Thomas Corrigan owned a retail grocery and liquor business in Newark, and the family's well-to-do status allowed Michael to pursue his educational interests. He attended [[St. Mary's College (Delaware)|St. Mary's College]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], from 1853\u20131855, [[Mount Saint Mary's University]] in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]] from 1855\u20131857, spent a year in Europe, and received his bachelor's degree from Mount Saint Mary's in 1859. He became a member of the first class at the [[Pontifical North American College|North American College]] in Rome, was ordained to the priesthood in September 1863 at the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|Basilica of St. John Lateran]], and received a doctorate of divinity in 1864.<ref name=Mooney>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04395a.htm Mooney, Joseph. \"Michael Augustine Corrigan.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 October 2015</ref>\n\nCorrigan returned to New Jersey in 1864, where he joined the faculty at [[Seton Hall University|Seton Hall College]] and the [[Immaculate Conception Seminary School of Theology|Immaculate Conception Seminary]], both in [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]], as professor of theology and history. He soon achieved a reputation within the hierarchy for sound scholarship, and he also provided pastoral care to Catholics in the Seton Hall vicinity. When [[Bernard J. McQuaid]] left Seton Hall in 1869 to assume his duties as bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Diocese of Rochester]], Corrigan succeeded him as college president and also became vicar general of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark|Diocese of Newark]].<ref name=Mooney/>\n\n==Bishop of Newark==\nCorrigan succeeded [[James Roosevelt Bayley]] as bishop of Newark, becoming the second ordinary of the diocese. He was consecrated bishop on May 4, 1873.<ref name=Mooney/> The diocese encompassed the entire state of [[New Jersey]] during Corrigan's tenure. He administered diocesan affairs during a time of rapid population growth, Roman Catholic institutional development, immigration from Ireland and Germany, and considerable urbanization in the northern part of the state.\n\n==Archbishop of New York==\nCorrigan was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop to [[John McCloskey|John Cardinal McCloskey]] of New York on October 1, 1880,<ref name=Grace>[https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/4845/John-Ireland-and-Michael-A-Corrigan.aspx Grace CVI, Madeline. \"John Ireland and Michael A. Corrigan\", ''OSV Newsweekly'', August 28, 2009]</ref> with the [[titular see]] of Petra, and succeeded to the archbishopric on October 10, 1885, serving as archbishop until his death.\n\nCorrigan's career in New York proved controversial on a number of levels. He aligned himself closely with his former mentor, [[Bernard J. McQuaid]] and has been considered one of the leaders of the \"conservative\" movement within the American Catholic hierarchy. He proved to be a strong supporter of [[national parish]]es<ref name=Grace/> and [[Catholic school|parochial schools]], a vocal opponent of [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], [[James Gibbons]] and other bishops who advocated \"[[Americanism (heresy)#Suppression of Americanism|Americanization]]\" within the Catholic Church.  Within the American hierarchy, he was the closest supporter of Pope Leo XIII on ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]''. He also proved unpopular with many bishops for his involvement in backstage intrigue at the Vatican.\n\nWithin the [[Archdiocese of New York]] his most serious controversy involved his conflict with Father [[Edward McGlynn]].  During the 1886 mayoral campaign in [[New York City]], the outspoken McGlynn supported [[Henry George]], the candidate of the [[Central Labor Union|United Labor Party]] who proved popular with labor organizers, radicals, socialists, and Irish nationalists. Corrigan himself had been very close to [[Tammany Hall]] and ordered McGlynn to refrain from politics. McGlynn refused, continued to clash with the bishop, and ultimately was removed as pastor of St. Stephen's Church in New York. McGlynn was summoned to Rome but refused on the grounds of ill health and was excommunicated in 1887. The censure was eventually lifted in 1892. This highly public scandal took its toll on Corrigan and contributed to his poor relationships with an influential group of New York intellectual priests. His greatest accomplishment probably involved the building of a new seminary, [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie]].\n\nIn 1897, [[Edgardo Mortara]] preached in St. Patrick's Cathedral [[New York City]], but the Archbishop of New York told the Holy See that he opposed Mortara's efforts to evangelize the Jews on the grounds that such efforts might embarrass the Church in the view of the [[United States]] government.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} He also had invited [[Mother Cabrini]] to New York, but had to withdraw his invitation. By then Mother Cabrini and her missionaries had already embarked on their sea voyage to New York.\n\nCorrigan slipped and fell when inspecting the excavation of the seminary in 1902. He contracted pneumonia during his convalescence and died. He was interred in the crypt under the altar of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]].\n\n{{Ordination\n| ordained deacon by   =\n| date of diaconal ordination =\n| place of diaconal ordination =\n| ordained priest by   = \n| date of priestly ordination = 19 September 1863\n| place of priestly ordination =\n| consecrated by       = [[John McCloskey]]\n| co-consecrators      = [[John Loughlin (bishop)|John Loughlin]]\n[[William George McCloskey]] \n| date of consecration = 4 May 1873\n| place of consecration =\n| elevated by          =\n| date of elevation    =\n\n| bishop 1             = [[Winand Michael Wigger]]\n| consecration date 1  = 1881\n| bishop 2             = [[Patrick Anthony Ludden]]\n| consecration date 2  = 1887\n| bishop 3             = [[Charles Edward McDonnell]]\n| consecration date 3  = 1892\n| bishop 4             = [[Henry Gabriels]]\n| consecration date 4  = 1892\n| bishop 5             = [[Thomas Martin Aloysius Burke]]\n| consecration date 5  = 1894\n| bishop 6             = [[James Augustine McFaul]]\n| consecration date 6  = 1894\n| bishop 7             = [[John Murphy Farley]]\n| consecration date 7  = 1895\n| bishop 8             = [[James Edward Quigley]]\n| consecration date 8  = 1897\n| bishop 9             = [[John J.

King [[Rama I]] made Rajakruluang the first governor of the area when establishing tighter connections with the [[Isan]] area. The main city was moved six times until in 1879 it reached its present-day location at Nuang Kaw. Khon Kaen was under the governance of Udon in the early period of Rattanakosin, c. 2450 BCE. [[The Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Program]], also known as the Lawa Project, an internationally recognized [[liver fluke]] control program, has its offices in the Ban Phai and Ban Haet Districts south of Khon Kaen city.\n\n==Geography==\nKhon Kaen occupies part of the [[Khorat Plateau]]. The [[Chi River|Chi]] and Phong Rivers flow through the province.\n\n==Symbols==\n{|\n|- valign=top\n||\n||The [[Seals of The Provinces of Thailand|seal of the province]] shows the ''stupa'' (tower) of [[Phra That Kham Kaen]], which is believed to contain relics of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. A tree is depicted on each side. One is a [[banyan]] tree (''Ficus benghalensis''), the other a [[Golden Shower Tree]] (''Cassia fistula''). The Thai name of the golden shower means 'providing support and preventing a decline', and it is also the provincial flower. The provincial tree is the pink shower tree (''[[Cassia bakeriana]]''), the Thai name of which translates as 'wishing tree'.\n|}\n\n==Culture==\n===Sinxay===\nThe mayor of Khon Kaen in 2005 chose [[Sinxay]] to be the new identity of the Khon Kaen and had finials designed representing Sinxay and his two brothers, Siho and Sangthong. the story of Sang Sinxay, one of the masterpieces of Lao literature written by Pang Kham in 1649, during the Ayutthaya period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.museum-press.com/content-\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e0b\u201c\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e19-4-5600-107946-1.html|title=\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e0b - \u201c\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\" \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27-\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e19}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|title       = Representations of characters from ''Sang Sinxay'' on lampposts in Khon Kaen\n|align       = left\n|footer      = \n|total_width = 600\n|text_align  = center\n|image1      = Sinxay Finial for a lamppost in Khon Kaen.jpg\n|width1      = 1062\n|height1     = 1103\n|caption1    = Lamppost finial depicting Sinxay\n|alt1        = \n|image2      = Siho Finials and Sticky Rice Baskets.jpg\n|width2      = 920\n|height2     = 1280\n|caption2    = Lamppost finial depicting Siho\n|alt2        = \n|image3      = Sangthong finial on Lamppost in Khon Kaen, Thailand.jpg\n|width3      = 1280\n|height3     = 888\n|caption3    = Lamppost finial depicting Sangthong\n|alt3        = \n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n===Provincial government===\n[[Image:Amphoe Khon Kaen.svg|thumb|250px|Map of 26 districts]]\nThe province is divided into 26 districts (''[[amphoe]]s'').

King [[Rama I]] made Rajakruluang the first governor of the area when establishing tighter connections with the [[Isan]] area. The main city was moved six times until in 1879 it reached its present-day location at Nuang Kaw. Khon Kaen was under the governance of Udon in the early period of Rattanakosin, c. 2450 BCE. [[The Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Program]], also known as the Lawa Project, an internationally recognized [[liver fluke]] control program, has its offices in the Ban Phai and Ban Haet Districts south of Khon Kaen city.\n\n==Geography==\nKhon Kaen occupies part of the [[Khorat Plateau]]. The [[Chi River|Chi]] and Phong Rivers flow through the province.\n\n==Symbols==\n{|\n|- valign=top\n||\n||The [[Seals of The Provinces of Thailand|seal of the province]] shows the ''stupa'' (tower) of [[Phra That Kham Kaen]], which is believed to contain relics of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. A tree is depicted on each side. One is a [[banyan]] tree (''Ficus benghalensis''), the other a [[Golden Shower Tree]] (''Cassia fistula''). The Thai name of the golden shower means 'providing support and preventing a decline', and it is also the provincial flower. The provincial tree is the pink shower tree (''[[Cassia bakeriana]]''), the Thai name of which translates as 'wishing tree'.\n|}\n\n==Culture==\n===Sinxay===\nThe mayor of Khon Kaen in 2005 chose [[Sinxay]] to be the new identity of the Khon Kaen and had finials designed representing Sinxay and his two brothers, Siho and Sangthong. the story of Sang Sinxay, one of the masterpieces of Lao literature written by Pang Kham in 1649, during the Ayutthaya period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.museum-press.com/content-\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e0b\u201c\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e19-4-5600-107946-1.html|title=\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e0b - \u201c\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\" \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27-\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e19}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|title       = Representations of characters from ''Sang Sinxay'' on lampposts in Khon Kaen\n|align       = left\n|footer      = \n|total_width = 600\n|text_align  = center\n|image1      = Sinxay Finial for a lamppost in Khon Kaen.jpg\n|width1      = 1062\n|height1     = 1103\n|caption1    = Lamppost finial depicting Sinxay\n|alt1        = \n|image2      = Siho Finials and Sticky Rice Baskets.jpg\n|width2      = 920\n|height2     = 1280\n|caption2    = Lamppost finial depicting Siho\n|alt2        = \n|image3      = Sangthong finial on Lamppost in Khon Kaen, Thailand.jpg\n|width3      = 1280\n|height3     = 888\n|caption3    = Lamppost finial depicting Sangthong\n|alt3        = \n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n===Provincial government===\n[[Image:Amphoe Khon Kaen.svg|thumb|250px|Map of 26 districts]]\nThe province is divided into 26 districts (''[[amphoe]]s'').

This unit of [[radiation exposure]] was named the [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] in honour of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who had died five years previously. At the 1937 meeting of the ICRU, this definition was extended to apply to [[gamma radiation]].<ref name=GM>{{cite conference\n|title = Dosimetry in Europe and the USSR\n|first1 = JH\n|last1 = Guill\n|first2 =John\n|last2 = Moteff\n|page = 64\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=czTi4G6-Hq8C&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=roentgen+redefinition#v=onepage&q=roentgen%20redefinition&f=false\n|conference = Symposium on Radiation Effects and Dosimetry - Third Pacific Area Meeting American Society for Testing Materials, October 1959, San Francisco, 12\u201316 October 1959\n|publisher = ASTM International\n|booktitle = Third Pacific Area Meeting Papers \u2014 Materials in Nuclear Applications |series=American Society Technical Publication |volume=276\n|lccn = 60014734\n|date = June 1960\n|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}</ref> This approach, although a great step forward in standardisation, had the disadvantage of not being a direct measure of the absorption of radiation, and thereby the ionisation effect, in various types of matter including human tissue, and was a measurement only of the effect of the X-rays in a specific circumstance; the ionisation effect in dry air.<ref name=Lovell4>{{cite book\n|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lK48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=roentgen+defined#v=onepage&q=roentgen%20defined&f=false\n|title = An introduction to Radiation Dosimetry\n|first1 = S\n|last1 = Lovell\n|year = 1979\n|chapter = 4: Dosimetric quantities and units\n|pages = 52\u201364\n|isbn = 0-521-22436-5\n|publisher = Cambridge University Press\n|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with [[William Valentine Mayneord]] and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a new unit of measure, dubbed the ''\"gram roentgen\"'' (symbol: gr) was proposed, and defined as \"that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation\".<ref name=\"Gupta2009\">{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=S.

The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim.

It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work.

Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily.

The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \"Viking Cave\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting [[edible bird's nest]]s.\n\nKo Phi Phi was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004]], when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sunset over a gypsy boat on Koh Phi Phi Island.jpg|thumb|Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi]]\nFrom archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]]. The original name for the islands was ''Pulau Api-Api'' ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the ''Pokok Api-Api'', or \"fiery tree\" ([[Avicennia marina|grey mangrove]]) which is found on the islands.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} southeast of Phuket and are part of [[Hat Nopparat Thara-Ko Phi Phi National Park]].

All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n;Ferry\nThere are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work.

Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily.

The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

{"title_page": "The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Marvel Graphic Novel}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[File:Marvel Collection Zombies.jpg|thumb|right|Issue 22, Volume 48: \"Marvel Zombies\"]]\n\n'''''The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection''''' (also referred to as '''''The Ultimate Graphic Novels Collection''''') is a fortnightly [[partwork]] [[magazine]] published by Hachette Partworks. The series is a collection of special edition [[hardback]] [[graphic novel]], collecting all the parts in a story-arc for one of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s best known superheroes, often a fan-favourite or \"important\" story from Marvel comics lore.\n\nThe series is published in the UK, Russia, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa by [[Hachette Partworks]], in Poland by Hachette Polska, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia by Panini Fascicule, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Per\u00fa and Chile by Editorial Salvat and in France and Germany by the French [[Hachette (publisher)|mother company]] of Hachette Collections.\nThe first English-language issue was published in December 2011 priced at \u00a32.99 (R29.95 in SA, $7.95 in AU) issue 2 was \u00a36.99 (R79.95 in SA, $12.95 in AU) and from issue 3 onwards it was its normal price of \u00a39.99 (R109.95 in SA, $19.95 in AU).\n\nThe series proved so successful for publisher Hachette Partworks that they launched a second series of 130 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks entitled ''[[The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection#Marvel.27s Mightiest Heroes|Marvel's Mightiest Heroes Graphic Novel Collection]]'' and a third (non-Marvel) series of 90 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks entitled ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', a fourth series of 100 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks called ''Transformers: The Definitive G1 Collection'' (featuring [[Transformers: Generation 1|Generation One]] strips from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] US and UK, [[Dreamwave]] and [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]) and a fifth series of 80 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks entitled ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]''. It also inspired a similar partwork [[line (comics)|line]] from [[DC Comics]] and Eaglemoss Collections, the ''[[DC Comics Graphic Novel Collection]]'' and one featuring ''[[Star Trek]]'' comics from the sixties up until modern comics called ''Star Trek Graphic Novel Collection'', and at the end of 2017 an even newer collection also by Eaglemoss ''[[DC Comics \u2013 The Legend Of Batman|DC Comics \u2013 The Legend Of Batman]]''\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that the collection would be re-released with alternative numbering.\n\n==Book content==\nAs well as the comic strip, each book features an introduction to the book, information on the character, writer and artist plus some of the artist's draft board sketches. 60 books are required to build up a panoramic picture on the spine<ref>[http://www.graphicnovelcollection.com/collection.html Image of Completed Collection]</ref> by artist [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]]. In April 2014, a flyer accompanying Issue 62 revealed the artwork by Dell'Otto had been extended to cover 120 volumes rather than the original 60.<ref>[http://www.mhtrek.net/lf/Untitled-1.jpg Image of Expanded Collection \u2013 Apr 2014]</ref>\n\nEach issue number of the collection is not the same as the books volume number (e.g. issue 1 is volume 21) as the volume number is the chronological release order of the original publication, whereas the issue number is the order in which they were released within this collection. Issue 1 was launched twice in the UK. Early subscribers to issue 1 (volume 21) may have received an edition with a different spine from those that subscribed to the subsequent launch. The panoramic artwork on the spine of this edition does not align with the volumes 20 or 22.\n\n===Magazine===\nThe first issue came with an extra magazine which contained information on the collection and short descriptions on some characters which will feature in the upcoming books. It also included some character history. The magazine also folded out into a giant poster depicting Marvel universe heroes drawn by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].\n\n==List of books==\nBelow is a list of the books from each issue in published date order.<ref>[http://www.hachettepartworks.com/marvel-ultimate-graphic-novels-2012 List of books at the publisher's website]</ref> Only the first six issues were officially announced, but each issue features a further reading section which advertised future books and their volume number, though not release number.<ref>[http://www.sidekickcast.com/?p=7644 Marvel Graphic Novel Collection Issue 12 review]</ref>  Early into the run, customer support provided a list of books to be published from issue seven onwards which was unverified, but proved to be accurate for sometime.<ref>[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=10162&PID=247129&SID=f81fac1329524d32e7ez5f2e7442a5cz#247129 Post on UXN Forums]</ref> The full list of issues was confirmed on the Hachette Partworks website but later removed as the order for some issues altered slightly.<ref name=backissues>[http://www.hachettepartworks.com/products/9340-marvel-graphic-novel-collection.aspx Hachette Partworks \u2013 Back Issues and related items]</ref>  Subsequently, it was announced via the collections official website that the set would continue for a further 60 issues. The release order for Issues 73\u2013120 was later verified via BookDepository.com<ref>[http://www.bookdepository.com/search/advanced?page=1&searchRefined=1&ieutf8=%E2%98%A0&searchAddedTerm=&searchTitle=&searchAuthor=&searchPublisher=Hachette-Partworks-Ltd&searchIsbn=&searchLang=&submit=Search&price=&availability=&format=&searchSortBy=pubdate_high_low]</ref> In April 2016, the May catalogue for PreviewsUK confirmed that an Issue 121 would be released as part of the original collection.<ref>PreviewsUK Catalogue \u2013 May16</ref> Subsequently, via the official Facebook page, it was confirmed that the original collection would now continue for a further 20 issues; therefore extending the set to 140 issues.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/HachetteMarvelGraphicNovels/posts/486711944860036?comment_id=487562874774943&notif_t=feed_comment_reply&notif_id=1461661535049874 Facebook confirmation of 2016 MGN extension]</ref> On May 9, 2017, in reply to a comment on the collection's facebook page, confirmation was made that the collection will now expand to 170 titles.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/HachetteMarvelCollections/posts/1574799115866047?comment_id=1576802912332334]</ref> On Dec 20th 2017, In reply to an email, a Facebook user was told that this has now been expanded, yet again with no prewarning to subscribers, to 200.<ref>[<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FHachetteMarvelCollections%2Fposts%2F1827339257278697&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]</ref>\n\nThe collection has been confirmed as being extended again to 220 issues, with zero notification, in reply to a query as to the end number on one of Hatchetts Facebook posts in July 2019. The exact phrasing was it is 'set' to run to 220, not that it will end at 220. \n\nHatchette have confirmed on April 7th via email that due to demand from the readers the collection will be extended beyond 220   \n\nThe table below contains the full list of issues as per the original printing of the collection beginning in December 2011.

However, the series was relaunched in January 2014 beginning with the same four issues.  However, this time the books built up a panoramic picture on the spine by artist [[Adi Granov]].  This means collectors who had purchased the original three volumes would have to purchase them again to complete the spine art.\n\nIn December 2015 the official Twitter account of the collection announced that the series has been extended for an additional forty issues.<ref>[https://twitter.com/WhosMightiest/status/684674315833454593 Tweet confirming extension of Marvel's Mightiest Heroes]</ref>\n\nThe series ended on 12 December 2018 after a total of 130 books.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===List of books===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"   \n|-\n!

The series is a collection of special edition [[hardback]] [[graphic novel]], collecting all the parts in a story-arc for one of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s best known superheroes, often a fan-favourite or \"important\" story from Marvel comics lore.\n\nThe series is published in the UK, Russia, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa by [[Hachette Partworks]], in Poland by Hachette Polska, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia by Panini Fascicule, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Per\u00fa and Chile by Editorial Salvat and in France and Germany by the French [[Hachette (publisher)|mother company]] of Hachette Collections.\nThe first English-language issue was published in December 2011 priced at \u00a32.99 (R29.95 in SA, $7.95 in AU) issue 2 was \u00a36.99 (R79.95 in SA, $12.95 in AU) and from issue 3 onwards it was its normal price of \u00a39.99 (R109.95 in SA, $19.95 in AU).\n\nThe series proved so successful for publisher Hachette Partworks that they launched a second series of 130 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks entitled ''[[The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection#Marvel.27s Mightiest Heroes|Marvel's Mightiest Heroes Graphic Novel Collection]]'' and a third (non-Marvel) series of 90 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks entitled ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', a fourth series of 100 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks called ''Transformers: The Definitive G1 Collection'' (featuring [[Transformers: Generation 1|Generation One]] strips from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] US and UK, [[Dreamwave]] and [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]) and a fifth series of 80 fortnightly graphic novel hardbacks entitled ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]''. It also inspired a similar partwork [[line (comics)|line]] from [[DC Comics]] and Eaglemoss Collections, the ''[[DC Comics Graphic Novel Collection]]'' and one featuring ''[[Star Trek]]'' comics from the sixties up until modern comics called ''Star Trek Graphic Novel Collection'', and at the end of 2017 an even newer collection also by Eaglemoss ''[[DC Comics \u2013 The Legend Of Batman|DC Comics \u2013 The Legend Of Batman]]''\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that the collection would be re-released with alternative numbering.\n\n==Book content==\nAs well as the comic strip, each book features an introduction to the book, information on the character, writer and artist plus some of the artist's draft board sketches. 60 books are required to build up a panoramic picture on the spine<ref>[http://www.graphicnovelcollection.com/collection.html Image of Completed Collection]</ref> by artist [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]]. In April 2014, a flyer accompanying Issue 62 revealed the artwork by Dell'Otto had been extended to cover 120 volumes rather than the original 60.<ref>[http://www.mhtrek.net/lf/Untitled-1.jpg Image of Expanded Collection \u2013 Apr 2014]</ref>\n\nEach issue number of the collection is not the same as the books volume number (e.g. issue 1 is volume 21) as the volume number is the chronological release order of the original publication, whereas the issue number is the order in which they were released within this collection. Issue 1 was launched twice in the UK. Early subscribers to issue 1 (volume 21) may have received an edition with a different spine from those that subscribed to the subsequent launch. The panoramic artwork on the spine of this edition does not align with the volumes 20 or 22.\n\n===Magazine===\nThe first issue came with an extra magazine which contained information on the collection and short descriptions on some characters which will feature in the upcoming books. It also included some character history. The magazine also folded out into a giant poster depicting Marvel universe heroes drawn by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].\n\n==List of books==\nBelow is a list of the books from each issue in published date order.<ref>[http://www.hachettepartworks.com/marvel-ultimate-graphic-novels-2012 List of books at the publisher's website]</ref> Only the first six issues were officially announced, but each issue features a further reading section which advertised future books and their volume number, though not release number.<ref>[http://www.sidekickcast.com/?p=7644 Marvel Graphic Novel Collection Issue 12 review]</ref>  Early into the run, customer support provided a list of books to be published from issue seven onwards which was unverified, but proved to be accurate for sometime.<ref>[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=10162&PID=247129&SID=f81fac1329524d32e7ez5f2e7442a5cz#247129 Post on UXN Forums]</ref> The full list of issues was confirmed on the Hachette Partworks website but later removed as the order for some issues altered slightly.<ref name=backissues>[http://www.hachettepartworks.com/products/9340-marvel-graphic-novel-collection.aspx Hachette Partworks \u2013 Back Issues and related items]</ref>  Subsequently, it was announced via the collections official website that the set would continue for a further 60 issues. The release order for Issues 73\u2013120 was later verified via BookDepository.com<ref>[http://www.bookdepository.com/search/advanced?page=1&searchRefined=1&ieutf8=%E2%98%A0&searchAddedTerm=&searchTitle=&searchAuthor=&searchPublisher=Hachette-Partworks-Ltd&searchIsbn=&searchLang=&submit=Search&price=&availability=&format=&searchSortBy=pubdate_high_low]</ref> In April 2016, the May catalogue for PreviewsUK confirmed that an Issue 121 would be released as part of the original collection.<ref>PreviewsUK Catalogue \u2013 May16</ref> Subsequently, via the official Facebook page, it was confirmed that the original collection would now continue for a further 20 issues; therefore extending the set to 140 issues.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/HachetteMarvelGraphicNovels/posts/486711944860036?comment_id=487562874774943&notif_t=feed_comment_reply&notif_id=1461661535049874 Facebook confirmation of 2016 MGN extension]</ref> On May 9, 2017, in reply to a comment on the collection's facebook page, confirmation was made that the collection will now expand to 170 titles.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/HachetteMarvelCollections/posts/1574799115866047?comment_id=1576802912332334]</ref> On Dec 20th 2017, In reply to an email, a Facebook user was told that this has now been expanded, yet again with no prewarning to subscribers, to 200.<ref>[<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FHachetteMarvelCollections%2Fposts%2F1827339257278697&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]</ref>\n\nThe collection has been confirmed as being extended again to 220 issues, with zero notification, in reply to a query as to the end number on one of Hatchetts Facebook posts in July 2019. The exact phrasing was it is 'set' to run to 220, not that it will end at 220. \n\nThe table below contains the full list of issues as per the original printing of the collection beginning in December 2011.

Although the first four titles were announced, only three were published and subscribers were told the series had been postponed.  However, the series was relaunched in January 2014 beginning with the same four issues.  However, this time the books built up a panoramic picture on the spine by artist [[Adi Granov]].  This means collectors who had purchased the original three volumes would have to purchase them again to complete the spine art.\n\nIn December 2015 the official Twitter account of the collection announced that the series has been extended for an additional forty issues.<ref>[https://twitter.com/WhosMightiest/status/684674315833454593 Tweet confirming extension of Marvel's Mightiest Heroes]</ref>\n\nThe series ended on 12 December 2018 after a total of 130 books.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===List of books===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"   \n|-\n!

[[First Nations]], the original inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area. Today there are few treaties, and the question of Aboriginal Title, long ignored, has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions.

The [[Definitions of Canadian borders#British Columbia|southern border of British Columbia]] was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as [[California]]. British Columbia's land area is {{convert|944735|km2|-2}}. [[British Columbia Coast|British Columbia's rugged coastline]] stretches for more than {{convert|27000|km}}, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. It is the only province in [[Canada]] that borders the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nBritish Columbia's capital is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], located at the southeastern tip of [[Vancouver Island]]. Only a narrow strip of Vancouver Island, from [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by [[temperate rainforest]].\nThe province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is at the confluence of the [[Fraser River]] and [[Georgia Strait]], in the mainland's southwest corner (an area often called the [[Lower Mainland]]). By land area, [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] is the largest city.

Terrain ranges from dry inland forests and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] valleys, to the range and canyon districts of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior]], to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the [[British Columbia Interior|Northern Interior]].

Other wine regions in British Columbia include the [[Cowichan Valley]] on Vancouver Island and the [[Fraser Valley]].\n\nThe Southern Interior cities of [[Kamloops]] and [[Penticton]] have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada (while higher elevations are cold and snowy), although their temperatures are often exceeded north of the [[Fraser Canyon]], close to the confluence of the Fraser and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers, where the terrain is rugged and covered with desert-type flora. Semi-desert grassland is found in large areas of the [[Interior Plateau]], with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones.\n\nThe northern, mostly mountainous, two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, except for the area east of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockies]], where the [[Peace River Country]] contains BC's portion of the [[Canadian Prairies]], centred at the city of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]].\n\nBritish Columbia is considered part of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadia bioregion]], along with the [[U.S. state|American states]] of [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] (western portion), [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |title=Pacific Northwest Washington Oregon British Columbia |publisher=Celebratebig.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222031254/http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cooltrails.com/ |title=Northwest Hiking Trails: Washington, Oregon, Idaho |publisher=Cooltrails.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119222550/http://www.cooltrails.com/ |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:British Columbia K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in British Columbia]]\n[[File:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|The [[Strait of Georgia]], near [[Vancouver]]]]\nBecause of the many mountain ranges and rugged coastline, British Columbia's climate varies dramatically across the province. \n\nCoastal southern British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate, influenced by the [[North Pacific Current]], which has its origins in the [[Kuroshio Current]]. [[Henderson Lake (British Columbia)|Henderson Lake]] on [[Vancouver Island]] receives an average of {{cvt|6,903|mm|in}} of rain annually, and some parts of the area are even classified as warm-summer [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], the northernmost occurrence in the world.

While it is thought [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, P\u00e9rez and Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the [[Pacific coast]], first made by [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] in 1513.\n\nThe explorations of [[James Cook]] in 1778 and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792\u201393 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of [[Dean Channel]] near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and other explorers\u2014notably [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], [[Samuel Black]], <!--also John Campbell and others but they're less well-known, though in some ways no less important; Black in particular-->and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]\u2014were primarily concerned with extending the [[fur trade]], rather than political considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.\n\nThe establishment of [[trading post]]s under the auspices of the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District was broadly defined as being south of 54\u00b040 north latitude, (the southern limit of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]]), north of Mexican-controlled California, and west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was, by the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], under the \"joint occupancy and use\" of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.\n\nThe major supply route was the [[York Factory Express]] between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Fort Vancouver]]. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St. John (established 1794); [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]] (1805); [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] (1805); [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]] (1806); [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (1807); Kamloops (1812); [[Fort Langley, British Columbia|Fort Langley]] (1827); [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843); [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include [[Vancouver, Washington]] ([[Fort Vancouver]]), formerly the \"capital\" of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, [[Colville, Washington]] and [[Walla Walla, Washington]] (old [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]]).\n\n[[File:Edward Gennys Fanshawe, Fort Rupert, Beaver Harbour, Vancouver's Island, July 23rd 1851 (Canada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Rupert]], Vancouver Island, 1851]]\nWith the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, modern-day British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the [[Thompson River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca District]], headquartered in [[Fort Chipewyan, Alberta|Fort Chipewyan]], in present-day Alberta.\n\nUntil 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of [[British North America]] under the [[de facto]] jurisdiction of HBC administrators; however, unlike [[Rupert's Land]] to the north and east, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern [[Columbia River drainage basin|Columbia Basin]] (within present day Washington and [[Oregon]]). In 1846, the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the territory along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Strait of Georgia]], with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, \"administered\" by individual HBC trading post managers.\n\n===Colony of British Columbia (1858\u201366)===\n{{Main|Colony of British Columbia (1858\u201366)|Richard Clement Moody}}\n\nWith the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial office]] to designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia. When news of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] reached London, Richard Clement Moody was hand-picked by the [[Colonial Office]], under [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire's \"bulwark in the farthest west\"<ref name=\"Donald J.

He was sworn in as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]] and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired [[Robert Burnaby]] as his personal secretary.\n\nIn British Columbia, Moody \"wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness\" and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, \"styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe\".<ref name=\"scott26\">{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Laura Elaine |title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |year=1983 |page=26}}</ref> Subsequent to the enactment of the ''Pre-emption Act'' of 1860, Moody settled the [[Lower Mainland]].

He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \"Mary Hill\" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated \"government reserves\", which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The ''Pre-emption Act'' did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.\n\nBy 1862, the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]]) up the [[Fraser Canyon]] to the prospecting region around [[Barkerville]]. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening [[sawmill]]s, and engaging in [[fishery|fishing]] and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of [[responsible government]] began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the [[New Westminster]] ''British Columbian'' and future [[Premier of British Columbia|premier]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]]. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally, the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor.\n\n===Later gold rushes===\n\nA series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] and [[Lillooet]], which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually [[Colony of British Columbia (1866\u201371)|succeeded in 1866]], when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] to form the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866\u201371)]], which was, in turn, succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1871.\n\n===Rapid growth and development===\n[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]] drives the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], November 7, 1885. Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]\n\nThe Confederation League, including such figures as [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]], and [[Robert Beaven]], led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). Several factors motivated this agitation, including the fear of annexation to the United States, the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush.\n\n[[File:Craigellachie (Gedenkstein).jpg|thumb|Memorial to the \"last spike\" in Craigellachie]]\nWith the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on July 20, 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled. The Treaty of Washington sent the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in 1871 and in 1903, the province's territory shrank again after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].\n\nPopulation in British Columbia continued to expand as the province's [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fishery|fishing]] sectors were developed. Mining activity was particularly notable throughout the Mainland, particularly in the [[Boundary Country]], in the [[Slocan Valley|Slocan]], in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]] around [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], the East Kootenay (the southeast corner of the province), the Fraser Canyon, the [[Cariboo District|Cariboo]], the [[Omineca Country|Omineca]] and the [[Cassiar Country|Cassiar]], so much so a common epithet for the Mainland, even after provincehood, was \"the Gold Colony\".<!--cite is the Akriggs, and Howay, and Ormsby, and others--> Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley, and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson River area, the Cariboo, the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]], and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.\n\nThe completion of the railway in 1885 was a huge boost to the province's economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, known as [[Gastown]], near the mouth of the [[Burrard Inlet]] was selected as the terminus of the railway, prompting the incorporation of the City as Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the [[Port of Vancouver]] spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], as the largest in [[Western Canada]]. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use\u2014specifically, its settlement and development\u2014were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources (such as the fishery).\n\n[[File:Statue of Queen Victoria, Victoria, Canada 02.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Statue of Queen Victoria (Victoria, British Columbia)|Statue of Queen Victoria]] outside the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]]]\nEstablishing a [[labor force|labour force]] to develop the province was problematic from the start, and British Columbia was the locus of immigration from Europe, China, Japan and India. The influx of a non-[[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation (much of it successful) to restrict the ability of [[Asian people]] to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of a [[Tax per head|head tax]]. This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. The subsequent [[Komagata Maru incident]] in 1914, where hundreds of Indians were denied entry into Vancouver, was also a direct result of the anti-Asian resentment at the time. By 1923, almost all [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese immigration had been blocked]] except for merchants, professionals, students and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the province continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line, the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk Pacific]], linking north-central British Columbia from the [[Yellowhead Pass]] through Prince George to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] was driven at [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]]. This opened up the [[British Columbia Coast|North Coast]] and the [[Bulkley Valley]] region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.\n\nIn [[World War I]], the province responded strongly to the call to assist the British Empire against its German foes in French and Belgian battlefields. About 55,570 of the 400,000 British Columbian residents, the highest per-capita rate in Canada, responded to the military needs. Horseriders from the province's Interior region and First Nations soldiers made contributions to Vimy Ridge and other battles. About 6,225 men from the province died in combat.<ref>British Columbia History magazine vol.48 no.2 Summer 2015, Book Review \u2013 From the West Coast to the Western Front: British Columbians and the Great War by Greg Dickson and Mark Forsythe</ref>\n\n===1920s to 1940s===\nWhen the men returned from the [[First World War]], they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hard-core drinking Vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war. Because of pressure from veterans, prohibition was quickly relaxed so the \"soldier and the working man\" could enjoy a drink, but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of \"soldier parties\" to represent their interests, variously named Soldier-Farmer, Soldier-Labour, and [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Farmer-Labour]] Parties. These formed the basis of the fractured labour-political spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties, including those who would eventually form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-operative Commonwealth]] and the early [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] splinter groups.\n[[File:Japanese internment camp in British Columbia.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Canadian internment|Internment camp]] for [[Japanese Canadians]] during [[World War II]]]]\n\nThe advent of [[prohibition in the United States]] created new opportunities, and many found employment or at least profit in cross-border liquor smuggling. Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this \"pirate economy\", although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. By the end of the 1920s, the end of prohibition in the U.S., combined with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], plunged the province into economic destitution during the 1930s. Compounding the already dire local economic situation, tens of thousands of men from colder parts of Canada swarmed into Vancouver, creating huge [[hobo]] jungles around [[False Creek]] and the Burrard Inlet [[Classification yard|rail yards]], including the old Canadian Pacific Railway mainline [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] through the heart of the [[Downtown Vancouver|city's downtown]] (at Hastings and Carrall). Increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts, an occupation of the main Post Office at [[Granville Street|Granville]] and [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of [[martial law]] on the docks for almost three years. A Vancouver contingent for the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] was organized and seized a train, which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a [[Gatling gun]] straddling the tracks at [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]; the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the Depression.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schroeder |first=Andreas |title=Carved From Wood; Mission, BC, 1861\u20131992'' |publisher=The Mission Foundation |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-55056-131-9}}</ref>\n\nThere were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce as never before.\n\nBritish Columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the Pacific Ocean to have close relations with [[East Asia]]. This closeness has often caused friction between cultures which has sometimes escalted into racist animosity towards those of Asian descent. This was most manifest during the Second World War when many people of [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese descent were relocated]] or interned in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior region]] of the province.\n\n===Coalition and the post-war boom===\n[[File:British Columbia Regiment 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own)|BC Regiment (DCOR)]], marching in [[New Westminster]], 1940]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the mainstream [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] and [[British Columbia Conservative Party|BC Conservative]] Parties of British Columbia united in a formal [[coalition government]] under new Liberal leader [[John Hart (Canadian politician)|John Hart]], who replaced [[Thomas Dufferin Pattullo|Duff Pattullo]] when the latter failed to win a majority in the [[1941 British Columbia general election|1941 election]]. While the Liberals won the most seats, they actually received fewer votes than the socialist [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). Pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival Conservatives led by [[Royal Maitland]] and was replaced by Hart, who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five Liberal and three Conservative ministers.<ref name=\"con\" /> The CCF was invited to join the coalition but refused.<ref name=\"con\" />\n\nThe pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of the Second World War was to prevent the CCF, which had won a surprise victory in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1944, from ever coming to power in British Columbia. The CCF's popular vote was high enough in the [[1945 British Columbia general election|1945 election]] that they were likely to have won three-way contests and could have formed government; however, the coalition prevented that by uniting the anti-[[socialism|socialist]] vote.<ref name=\"con\" /> In the post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the completion of [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] north of Prince George to the Peace River Block, a section called the John Hart Highway and also public hospital insurance.\n\nIn 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken over by [[Byron Ingemar Johnson]]. The Conservatives had wanted their new leader [[Herbert Anscomb]] to be premier, but the Liberals in the Coalition refused. Johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in British Columbia history (61%) in the [[1949 British Columbia general election|1949 election]]. This victory was attributable to the popularity of his government's spending programmes, despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power. During his tenure, major infrastructures continued to expand, such as the agreement with [[Rio Tinto Alcan|Alcan Aluminum]] to build the town of [[Kitimat, British Columbia|Kitimat]] with an aluminum smelter and the large [[Kemano Generating Station|Kemano Hydro Project]].<ref>{{Cite journal |date=June 1952 |title=Boom in the Big Triangle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA102 |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=102\u2013107/246}}</ref> Johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the 1948 flooding of the Fraser Valley, which was a major blow to that region and to the province's economy.\n\nOn February 13, 1950, a [[1950 British Columbia B-36 crash|Convair B-36B crashed]] in northern British Columbia after jettisoning a [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|Mark IV]] [[atomic bomb]].

I think; BC referenda/plebiscites need a history/list article of their own--> prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a [[Ranked voting systems|preferential ballot]]), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%.\n\nThe Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA [[W. A. C. Bennett]], formed a [[minority government]] backed by the Liberals and Conservatives (with 6 and 4 seats respectively). Bennett began a series of fiscal reforms, preaching a new variety of [[populism]] as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development, laying the ground for a [[1953 British Columbia general election|second election in 1953]] in which the new Bennett regime secured a majority of seats, with 38% of the vote. Secure with that majority, Bennett returned the province to the first-past-the-post system thereafter, which is still in use.\n\n===1952\u20131960s===\nWith the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked on a phase of rapid [[economic development]]. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.\n\nDuring these two decades, the government [[Nationalization|nationalized]] British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity [[BC Hydro]]. [[West Kootenay Power and Light]] remained independent of BC Hydro, being owned and operated by [[Cominco]], though tied into the regional power grid. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in\u2014among others\u2014the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Columbia, and [[Nechako River]] watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to [[Kemano]], was to supply power to the [[Alcan Inc.]] aluminum smelter at [[Kitimat]], and was not part of the provincial power grid but [[Independent Power Producers in British Columbia|privately owned]]). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the [[Columbia River Treaty]] between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established [[BC Ferries]] as a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]], to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system, also supported by federal grants as being part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.\n\nVancouver and Victoria became cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and ''haute cuisine'' chefs flocked to its scenery and warmer temperatures, with the cultural and entrepreneurial community bolstered by many [[Draft dodgers]] from the United States. Tourism also played a role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a boost to British Columbia's economy, primarily because of exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nPolitically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the [[labour movement]], sharpened as so-called [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by Social Credit\u2014in opposition to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between [[hippie]]s and [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver mayor]] [[Tom Campbell (Canadian politician)|Tom Campbell]] was particularly legendary, culminating in the [[Gastown riots]] of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nOn August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector, but BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871\u20131986 |work=Elections BC |year=1998 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614185856/http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2007 |access-date=April 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) government under [[Dave Barrett]]. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} although changes to the accounting system makes it likely some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its \"[[two sets of books]]\", as WAC Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three-year (\"Thousand Days\") period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]], a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.\n\nPerceptions the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the [[1975 British Columbia general election|1975 general election]]. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[Bill Bennett]], was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the [[Ministry of Forests]], reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP\u2014notably the creation of the [[Whistler, British Columbia|Resort Municipality of Whistler]], whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.\n\nAlso during the \"MiniWac\" regime (a reference to his father's acronym, WAC) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were \"privatized\" in a mass giveaway of shares in the [[British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation]], \"BCRIC\", with the \"Brick shares\" soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several [[megaproject]]s meant to stimulate the economy and win votes \u2013 unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of [[Expo 86]], to which was tied the construction of the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] and Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the [[Doman Scandal]], in which the premier and millionaire backer Herb Doman were investigated for insider-trading and [[securities fraud]]. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.\n\n[[File:Coquilhalla Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Coquihalla Highway]] was one of the legacies of the [[Expo 86]] [[world's fair]], though creation of the [[toll road|toll highway]] sparked controversy.]]\n\nAs the province entered a sustained [[recession]], Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Henry Pybus Bell-Irving]], was forced to call Bennett to [[Government House (British Columbia)|Government House]] to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]] no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, Bennett won an unexpected majority.\n\nAfter several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|House]] was finally called and in the [[speech from the throne]] the Socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed \"restraint\", which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to \"motherhood\" issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people.\n\nThis became known as the 1983 [[Solidarity Crisis]], from the name of the [[Solidarity Coalition]], a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour]] forming a separate organization of unions, [[Operation Solidarity]], under the direction of [[Jack Munro]], then-President of the [[International Woodworkers of America]] (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt a [[general strike]] would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at [[Pacific Press Publishing Association|Pacific Press]] ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Bryan |title=Solidarity: The Rise and Fall of an Opposition in British Columbia |publisher=New Star Books |year=1987 |location=Vancouver}}</ref>\n\nA tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party [[grande dame]] [[Grace McCarthy]], and the charismatic but eccentric [[Bill Vander Zalm]].\n\nBill Vander Zalm became the new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a [[conflict of interest]] scandal following the sale of [[Fantasy Gardens]], a Christian and [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]] [[Amusement park|theme park]] built by the Premier, to [[Tan Yu]], a [[Filipino Chinese]] gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor [[Faye Leung (businesswoman)|Faye Leung]] of a party in the \"Howard Hughes Suite\" on the top two floors of the [[Bayshore Inn]], where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a [[bag of money]] in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and [[Rita Johnston]] became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor [[Mike Harcourt]].\n\nIn 1988, [[David Lam (real estate entrepreneur)|David Lam]] was appointed as British Columbia's twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor, and was the province's first Lieutenant-Governor of Chinese origin.\n\n===1990s to present===\n{{update|type=section|date=August 2012}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\nJohnston lost the [[1991 British Columbia general election|1991 general election]] to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the province's growing [[tourism]] sector, although the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over \"[[Bingogate]]\"\u2014a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. [[Glen Clark]], a former president of the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour|BC Federation of Labour]], was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the [[Fast Ferry Scandal]] involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the Premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by [[Dan Miller (Canadian politician)|Dan Miller]] who was in turn followed by [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] following a leadership convention.\n\nIn the 2001 general election [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]'s BC Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the \"fast ferries\" project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of [[BC Rail]] to CN Rail. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] during a vacation in Hawaii, but he still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 general election against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the [[2009 British Columbia general election|2009 provincial election]], marking the first time in 23 years a premier has been elected to a third term.\n\nThe province won a bid to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver and Whistler. As promised in his 2002 re-election campaign, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell staged a non-binding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the Olympics. In February 2003, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wallechinsky |first=D. |title=The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics: 2010 Edition |last2=Loucky |first2=J. |year=2010 |page=12}}</ref>\n[[File:Christy Clark by Kris Krug 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Christy Clark was Premier of British Columbia from 2011 until 2017.]]\nAfter the Olympic joy had faded, Campbell's popularity started to fall. His management style, the implementation of the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) against election promises and the cancelling of the [[BC Legislature Raids|BC Rail corruption trial]] lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support. He would resign in November 2010 and call on the party to elect a new leader.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-premier-campbell-stepping-down-1.911669 |title=BC Premier Campbell stepping down |date=November 3, 2010 |access-date=May 22, 2014 |publisher=[[CBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2011, former Deputy Premier [[Christy Clark]] became leader of the Liberal Party. Though she was not a sitting MLA, she went on to win the seat left vacant by Campbell. For the next two years, she attempted to distance herself from the unpopularity of Campbell and forge an image for [[2013 British Columbia general election|the upcoming 2013 election]]. Among her early accomplishments were raising the minimum wage, creating a new statutory holiday in February called \"Family Day\", and pushing the development of BC's [[liquified natural gas]] industry. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP by a double-digit gap in the polls, but were able to achieve a surprise victory on election night, winning a majority and making Clark the first elected woman premier in BC history.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/christy-clark-leads-b-c-liberals-to-surprise-majority-1.1315526 |title=Christy Clark leads BC Liberals to surprise majority |date=May 15, 2013 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate [[David Eby]], she later won a by-election in the riding of [[Westside-Kelowna]]. Her government would go on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]].\n[[File:John Horgan 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|John Horgan has been Premier of British Columbia since 2017.]]\n\nIn [[2017 British Columbia general election|the 2017 election]], the NDP formed a minority government with the support of the Green Party through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence and supply agreement]]. The NDP and Green caucuses together control 44 seats, compared to the Liberals' 43. On July 18, 2017, NDP leader John Horgan was officially sworn in as premier of British Columbia. He was the province's first NDP premier in 16 years.\n\nBritish Columbia was also significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to [[China]]. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades,{{when|date=January 2019}} because of its natural environment, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but has been particularly true during periods of economic growth.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} British Columbia has moved from approximately 10% of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13% in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean the [[Greater Vancouver]] area now includes 51% of the province's population, followed by [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] with 8%. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.\n\nBy 2018, housing prices Vancouver were the second-least affordable in the world, behind only Hong Kong.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/hong-kong-housing-ranked-world-s-least-affordable-for-9th-year</ref> Many experts point to evidence of money-laundering from mainland China as a contributing factor. The high price of residential real estate has led to the implementation of an empty homes tax, a housing speculation and vacancy tax, and a foreign buyers' tax on housing.<ref>https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Gaming_Final_Report.pdf</ref>\n\nThe net number of people coming to BC from other [[province]]s has grown almost four times larger since 2012. BC was the largest net recipient of [[Interprovincial migration in Canada|interprovincial migrants in Canada]] in the first quarter of 2016 with half of the 5,000 people coming from [[Alberta]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/canadians-flock-to-b-c-in-search-of-jobs |title=Canadians flock to B.C. in search of jobs |last=Carman |first=Tara |date=August 5, 2016 |website=The Vancouver Sun |access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Canada British Columbia Density 2016.png|thumb|right|Population density of British Columbia]]\n{{Main|Demographics of British Columbia}}\n{{See also|List of cities in Canada#British Columbia|List of communities in British Columbia|List of municipalities in British Columbia}}\n\n=== Population ===\nWith an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2020, it is Canada's third-most populous province.\n{{Graph:Chart\n | width = 300\n | height= 200\n | type = line\n | interpolate = basis\n | xType = date\n | xAxisAngle = -40\n | yAxisTitle = Population\n | yGrid = yes\n | linewidth = 2\n | x = 1851, 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1975, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016\n | y = 55000, 51524, 36247, 49459, 98173, 178657, 392480, 524582, 694263, 817861, 1165210, 1398464, 1629082, 1873674, 2184620, 2466610, 2744467, 2883370, 3282061, 3724500, 3907738, 4113487, 4400057, 4648055\n | colors = #f47f28\n}}\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo62k.htm |title=Statistics Canada&nbsp;\u2013 Population |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519055145/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo62k.htm |archive-date=May 19, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060927/d060927a.htm |title=Canada's population |publisher=Statistics Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104230200/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060927/d060927a.htm |archive-date=November 4, 2008 |access-date=September 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Cities====\n[[File:Vancouver ib.jpg|thumb|The Vancouver skyline]]\n{{See also|List of cities in British Columbia|List of metropolitan areas in British Columbia|List of municipalities in British Columbia|List of regional districts of British Columbia}}\nHalf of all British Columbians live in the Metro Vancouver area, which includes Vancouver, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[New Westminster]], [[West Vancouver]], [[North Vancouver (city)]], [[North Vancouver (district municipality)]], [[Burnaby]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Port Coquitlam]], [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]], [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley (city)]], [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley (district municipality)]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Pitt Meadows]], [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Port Moody]], [[Anmore]], [[Belcarra]], [[Lions Bay, British Columbia|Lions Bay]] and [[Bowen Island]], with adjacent unincorporated areas (including the [[University Endowment Lands]]) represented in the regional district as the [[List of regional district electoral areas in British Columbia|electoral area]] known as [[Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A, British Columbia|Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A]].

Its climate encourages [[outdoor recreation]] and [[tourism]], though its economic mainstay has long been [[resource extraction]], principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city, serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average. While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada. The [[Interior of British Columbia|Northern Interior]] region has a [[subarctic climate]] with very cold winters. The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities, with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1 |title=Canadian climate normals 1981\u20132010 Vancouver International Airport |publisher=Environment Canada |access-date=October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBritish Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining.

In practice, this is usually the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|Chief Justice of British Columbia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBritish Columbia has an 87-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the [[plurality voting system]], though from 2003 to 2009 there was significant debate about switching to a [[single transferable vote]] system called [[BC-STV]]. The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios, what are officially part of the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]], of whom the premier is chair.\n\nThe province is governed by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (BC NDP) under Premier [[John Horgan]]. The 2017 provincial election saw the Liberal Party take 43 seats, the NDP take 41, and the [[British Columbia Green Party]] take 3. No party met the minimum of 44 seats for a majority, therefore leading to the first minority government since 1953. Following the election, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP, eventually announcing they would support the current NDP minority. Previously, the right-of-centre [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] governed the province for 16 years between 2001 and 2017, and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats. The legislature became more evenly divided between the Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 Liberal seats of 79) and 2009 (49 Liberal seats of 85) provincial elections. The NDP and its predecessor the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have ruled with majority governments in 1972\u20131975 and 1991\u20132001. The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. After a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39%), the party's vote share declined (2005 \u2013 9.17%, 2009 \u2013 8.09%, 2013 \u2013 8.13%) before increasing again to a record high of 16.84% at the 2017 election.\n\nThe British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been [[third party (politics)|third parties]] present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Green Party]] are the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.\n\nPrior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.\n\n[[File:BC-Legislative-Assembly-Chamber.jpg|thumb|The meeting chamber of the Legislative Assembly]]\nBritish Columbia is known for having politically active labour [[trade union|unions]] who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.\n\nBritish Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to [[McGowan's War]] in 1858\u201359). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the [[Robert Bonner (politician)|Robert Bonner]] Affair and the [[Fantasy Gardens]] scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era. NDP scandals included Bingogate, which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals plagued the 2001\u20132017 Liberal government, including Premier Gordon Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A Christmas Eve{{which|date=April 2015}} [[BC Legislature Raids|raid on the Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}{{Update inline|date=February 2020}} Campbell eventually resigned in late 2010 due to opposition to his government's plan to introduce a [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) and was replaced by [[Christy Clark]] as premier in a 2011 BC Liberal leadership election.\n\nBritish Columbia is underrepresented in the [[Senate of Canada]], leading Premier Christy Clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal government's reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use non-partisan criteria. Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December 3, 2015, Clark issued a statement that it did \"not address what's been wrong with the Senate since the beginning\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Gloria |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-setting-up-advisory-board-to-fill-empty-senate-seats/article27577333/ |title=Liberals to set up advisory board for Senate nominees, but BC won't take part |date=December 3, 2015 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=December 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe imbalance in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size.

The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around [[Cape Horn]] or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.\n\nUntil the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the [[Crowsnest Highway|Crowsnest Pass Highway]]), and later the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.\n\n===Roads and highways===\n{{Main|List of British Columbia provincial highways}}\n[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge from below.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] on [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] between Richmond and Delta]]\nBecause of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now [[controlled-access highway|freeways]] in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane [[arterial road|arterial highways]] with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.\n[[File:Highway 1, Burnaby.jpg|alt=|thumb|British Columbia Highway 1 near Brentwood, Burnaby]]\nA couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median [[traffic barrier]]s. [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] on [[Vancouver Island]] and Highway 97 through the [[Okanagan Valley]] are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from 50&nbsp;km/h to maximums just slightly lower than the principal [[grade-separated]] highways. Numerous [[traffic light]]s operate in place of [[interchange (road)|interchanges]] on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] and Infrastructure.<ref name=\"BC highways\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/tran/ |title=BC highways |work=BC ministry of transportation and infrastructure |year=2013 |access-date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: [[British Columbia provincial highway 3|BC Highway 3]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], the [[Vermilion Pass]] (Highway 93 in both [[British Columbia Highway 93|British Columbia]] and [[Alberta Highway 93|Alberta]]), the [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through [[Banff National Park]], the [[Yellowhead Highway]] (16) through [[Jasper National Park]], and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] through [[Dawson Creek]]. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running {{convert|2081|km|abbr=on}} from the British Columbia-Washington border at [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] north to [[Watson Lake, Yukon]] and which includes the British Columbia portion of the [[Alaska Highway]].\n\n===Public transit===\nPrior to 1979, surface [[public transport|public transit]] was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established [[BC Transit]] to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, now [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District, was established. Some smaller island communities, such as [[Gabriola Island]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gabriolacommunitybus.com/about/history/ |title=History: GERTIE: Gabriola's Environmentally Responsible Trans Island Express |website=GERTIE |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref> and, formerly, [[Pender Island]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://penderbus.org/about |title=About the Bus |website=Pender Island Community Bus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113210800/http://penderbus.org/about |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |title=Community Bus Pilot Project Ending |website=Pender Island Community Bus |publisher=Pender Island Community Bus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110235046/http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |archive-date=January 10, 2019 |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> operate routes independent of BC Transit or TransLink.

There is planning for an extension of the Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the [[University of British Columbia]]. Turnstiles have been added to all existing stations in the system. In the past, SkyTrain used a proof of payment honour system.

Two major routes through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway \u2013 the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], terminating at [[Prince Rupert]], and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], terminating at Vancouver.\n\nThe [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] provided rail services in Victoria and Vancouver between the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century.\n\nThe [[Pacific Great Eastern]] line supplemented this service, providing a north\u2013south route between interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] with [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]]. The E&N Railway, rebranded as [[Southern Railway of Vancouver Island]], formerly served the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island. Service along the route is now minimal. Vancouver Island was also host to the [[Englewood Railway|last logging railway in North America]] until its closure in 2017.\n\nCurrent passenger services in British Columbia are limited. [[Via Rail Canada]] operates six long distance trains on two lines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/VIARail_Timetable.pdf |title=Via Rail Timetable |website=Via Rail Canada |publisher=Via Rail Canada |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> Local services are limited to two regions, with [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] providing rapid transit and commuter services in the [[Lower Mainland]] and by the [[Seton Lake Indian Band]] South of [[Lillooet]] with the [[Kaoham Shuttle]].

It now operates 25 routes among the [[List of islands of British Columbia|islands of British Columbia]], as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the [[Washington State Ferries]] (between [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]]) and [[MV Coho|Black Ball Transport]] (between Victoria and [[Port Angeles, Washington]]). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the provincial government. Various other coastal ferries are operated privately.\n\nCommercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are at Vancouver, [[Roberts Bank]] (near [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]), [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], and Victoria.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 |title=International Shipping in British Columbia |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729172613/http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 |archive-date=July 29, 2013 |access-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/images/docs/BCPortsHandbook2014.pdf |title=''BC Ports handbook'' |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC}}</ref>\nOf these, the [[Port of Vancouver]] is the most important, being the largest in Canada and the most diversified in North America.\n\nVancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for [[cruise ship]]s. In 2007, a large maritime [[Containerization|container port]] was opened in [[Prince Rupert Port Authority|Prince Rupert]] with an inland sorting port in Prince George.\n\n===Air===\n{{Main|List of airports in British Columbia}}\nThere are over 200 airports throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the [[Vancouver International Airport]], the [[Victoria International Airport]], the [[Kelowna International Airport]], and the [[Abbotsford International Airport]], the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. {{As of|2017}}, Vancouver International Airport is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|2nd busiest airport]] in the country and the second biggest International Gateway on the west coast (after Los Angeles) with an estimated 17.9&nbsp;million travellers passing through in 2008.\n\n==Outdoor life==\n[[File:Whistler ice sailor.jpg|thumb|Ice sailing in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]]]\n[[File:Holland Point Shoreline Trail, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada 05.jpg|thumb|Shoreline Trail in Victoria]]\nGiven its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].\n\nWater sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. [[Sea kayak]]ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its [[fjord]]s. [[Whitewater]] [[rafting]] and [[kayak]]ing are popular on many inland rivers. [[Sailing]] and [[Windsurfing|sailboarding]] are widely enjoyed.\n\nIn winter, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] and [[telemark skiing]] are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] [[skiing]] has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the [[Columbia Mountains]]. [[Snowboarding]] has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] downhill events were held in [[Whistler Blackcomb]] area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.\n\nIn Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for [[jogging|joggers]] and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the [[Bicycle gearing|ten-speed]] bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust [[mountain bike]], trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. A 2016 poll on global biking website Pinkbike rated BC as the top destination mountain bikers would like to ride.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pinkbike.com/news/where-would-you-go-if-you-could-road-trip-anywhere-pinkbike-poll-2016.html |title=Where would you go, if you could road trip anywhere? \u2013 Pinkbike Poll |work=Pinkbike |access-date=March 2, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. [[Longboarding]] is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.\n\n[[Equestrianism|Horseback riding]] is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for [[trail riding]], often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.\n\nBritish Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[curling]], [[disc golf]], [[Ultimate Canada|Ultimate]] and [[figure skating]]. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and [[winter sport]]s.\n\nConsistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of [[Luxury resort|lodges]], [[chalet]]s, [[bed and breakfast]]s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.\n\nIn certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting [[ecotourism]] in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the [[WWOOF]] Canada program.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wwoof.ca/ |title=WWOOF&nbsp;\u2013 Willing Workers on Organic Farms, Canada}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:SFU Aerial.jpg|alt=|thumb|Aerial view of [[Simon Fraser University]] in Burnaby]]\n{{see also|Higher education in British Columbia}}\nPublic universities and colleges include:\n{{col div}}\n* [[University of British Columbia]]\n* [[Simon Fraser University]]\n* [[University of Victoria]]\n* [[University of Northern British Columbia]]\n* [[Vancouver Island University]]\n* [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]\n* [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]]\n* [[Thompson Rivers University]]\n* [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]]\n* [[Royal Roads University]]\n* [[Capilano University]]\n* [[University of the Fraser Valley]]\n* [[Douglas College]]\n* [[Camosun College]]\n* [[Langara College]]\n* [[Selkirk College]]\n* [[College of New Caledonia]]\n* [[College of the Rockies]]\n* [[Okanagan College]]\n* [[Coast Mountain College]]\n{{col div end}}\nIn September 2014 there were 11,000 international students in BC public K-12 schools and about 3,000 international students in other BC K-12 schools.<ref>Sherlock, Tracy. \"[https://vancouversun.com/business/school+shutdown+China+concerned/10193719/story.html BC school shutdown has China 'concerned'].\" ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''.

In 1871, British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada. Its [[Latin]] motto is ''Splendor sine occasu'' (\"Splendour without Diminishment\").\n\nThe capital of British Columbia is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|fifteenth-largest metropolitan region]] in Canada, named for [[Queen Victoria]], who ruled during the creation of the original colonies. The largest city is [[Vancouver]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Canada, the largest in [[Western Canada]], and the second-largest in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. In October 2013, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 (about 2.5&nbsp;million of whom were in [[Greater Vancouver]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Demography/PopulationEstimates.aspx |title=Population Estimates, British Columbia and Sub-Provincial |date=December 2012 |publisher=BC Stats |access-date=February 12, 2014}}</ref> The province is currently governed by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]], led by [[John Horgan]], in a minority government with the [[confidence and supply]] of the [[Green Party of British Columbia]]. Horgan became [[Premier (Canada)|premier]] as a result of a no-confidence motion on June 29, 2017.\n\nBritish Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871. [[First Nations]], the original inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area. Today there are few treaties, and the question of Aboriginal Title, long ignored, has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions. Notably, the [[Tsilhqot'in]] Nation has established Aboriginal title to a portion of their territory, as a result of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision in ''[[Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe province's name was chosen by [[Queen Victoria]], when the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858\u20131866)]], i.e., \"the Mainland\", became a British colony in 1858.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ged |year=1978 |title=The Naming of British Columbia |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=257\u2013263 |doi=10.2307/4048132 |jstor=4048132}}</ref> It refers to the [[Columbia District]], the British name for the territory drained by the [[Columbia River]], in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-[[Oregon Treaty]] [[Columbia Department]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].

The [[Definitions of Canadian borders#British Columbia|southern border of British Columbia]] was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as [[California]]. British Columbia's land area is {{convert|944735|km2|-2}}. [[British Columbia Coast|British Columbia's rugged coastline]] stretches for more than {{convert|27000|km}}, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. It is the only province in [[Canada]] that borders the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nBritish Columbia's capital is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], located at the southeastern tip of [[Vancouver Island]]. Only a narrow strip of Vancouver Island, from [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by [[temperate rainforest]].\nThe province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is at the confluence of the [[Fraser River]] and [[Georgia Strait]], in the mainland's southwest corner (an area often called the [[Lower Mainland]]). By land area, [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] is the largest city. [[Vanderhoof, British Columbia|Vanderhoof]] is near the geographic centre of the province.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm |title=Vanderhoof |publisher=Tourism BC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709215521/http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm |archive-date=July 9, 2011 |access-date=April 26, 2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Bcmap.png|alt=Outline map of British Columbia with significant cities and towns.|left|thumb|Outline map of British Columbia with significant cities and towns]]\nThe [[Coast Mountains]] and the [[Inside Passage]]'s many [[fjord|inlets]] provide some of British Columbia's renowned and spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and [[ecotourism]] industry. 75% of the province is mountainous (more than {{convert|1000|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]); 60% is forested; and only about 5% is arable.\n\nThe province's mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the Pacific Ocean. Terrain ranges from dry inland forests and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] valleys, to the range and canyon districts of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior]], to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the [[British Columbia Interior|Northern Interior]]. High mountain regions both north and south have [[Montane ecosystems#Subalpine zone|subalpine flora]]<ref name=\"Subalpine\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/Bro/bro55.pdf |title=The Ecology of the Engelmann Spruce \u2013 Subalpine Fir Zone |publisher=B.C.

Other wine regions in British Columbia include the [[Cowichan Valley]] on Vancouver Island and the [[Fraser Valley]].\n\nThe Southern Interior cities of [[Kamloops]] and [[Penticton]] have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada (while higher elevations are cold and snowy), although their temperatures are often exceeded north of the [[Fraser Canyon]], close to the confluence of the Fraser and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers, where the terrain is rugged and covered with desert-type flora. Semi-desert grassland is found in large areas of the [[Interior Plateau]], with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones.\n\nThe northern, mostly mountainous, two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, except for the area east of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockies]], where the [[Peace River Country]] contains BC's portion of the [[Canadian Prairies]], centred at the city of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]].\n\nBritish Columbia is considered part of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadia bioregion]], along with the [[U.S. state|American states]] of [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] (western portion), [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |title=Pacific Northwest Washington Oregon British Columbia |publisher=Celebratebig.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222031254/http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cooltrails.com/ |title=Northwest Hiking Trails: Washington, Oregon, Idaho |publisher=Cooltrails.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119222550/http://www.cooltrails.com/ |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:British Columbia K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in British Columbia]]\n[[File:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|The [[Strait of Georgia]], near [[Vancouver]]]]\nBecause of the many mountain ranges and rugged coastline, British Columbia's climate varies dramatically across the province. \n\nCoastal southern British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate, influenced by the [[North Pacific Current]], which has its origins in the [[Kuroshio Current]]. [[Henderson Lake (British Columbia)|Henderson Lake]] on [[Vancouver Island]] receives an average of {{cvt|6,903|mm|in}} of rain anually, and some parts of the area are even classified as warm-summer [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], the northernmost occurence in the world. In [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the annual average temperataure is {{cvt|11.2|C|F}}, the warmest in Canada.\n\nDue to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the climate of some of the interior valleys of the province is semi-arid with certain locations receiving less than {{convert|250|mm}} in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to {{convert|12|C|0}}, the mildest anywhere in Canada.\n\nThe valleys of the Southern Interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow, while those in the [[Cariboo]], in the [[British Columbia Interior#Central Interior|Central Interior]], are colder because of increased altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada.

While it is thought [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, P\u00e9rez and Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the [[Pacific coast]], first made by [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] in 1513.\n\nThe explorations of [[James Cook]] in 1778 and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792\u201393 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of [[Dean Channel]] near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and other explorers\u2014notably [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], [[Samuel Black]], <!--also John Campbell and others but they're less well-known, though in some ways no less important; Black in particular-->and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]\u2014were primarily concerned with extending the [[fur trade]], rather than political considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.\n\nThe establishment of [[trading post]]s under the auspices of the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District was broadly defined as being south of 54\u00b040 north latitude, (the southern limit of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]]), north of Mexican-controlled California, and west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was, by the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], under the \"joint occupancy and use\" of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.\n\nThe major supply route was the [[York Factory Express]] between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Fort Vancouver]]. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St. John (established 1794); [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]] (1805); [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] (1805); [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]] (1806); [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (1807); Kamloops (1812); [[Fort Langley, British Columbia|Fort Langley]] (1827); [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843); [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include [[Vancouver, Washington]] ([[Fort Vancouver]]), formerly the \"capital\" of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, [[Colville, Washington]] and [[Walla Walla, Washington]] (old [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]]).\n\n[[File:Edward Gennys Fanshawe, Fort Rupert, Beaver Harbour, Vancouver's Island, July 23rd 1851 (Canada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Rupert]], Vancouver Island, 1851]]\nWith the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, modern-day British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the [[Thompson River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca District]], headquartered in [[Fort Chipewyan, Alberta|Fort Chipewyan]], in present-day Alberta.\n\nUntil 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of [[British North America]] under the [[de facto]] jurisdiction of HBC administrators; however, unlike [[Rupert's Land]] to the north and east, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern [[Columbia River drainage basin|Columbia Basin]] (within present day Washington and [[Oregon]]). In 1846, the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the territory along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Strait of Georgia]], with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, \"administered\" by individual HBC trading post managers.\n\n===Colony of British Columbia (1858\u201366)===\n{{Main|Colony of British Columbia (1858\u201366)|Richard Clement Moody}}\n\nWith the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial office]] to designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia. When news of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] reached London, Richard Clement Moody was hand-picked by the [[Colonial Office]], under [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire's \"bulwark in the farthest west\"<ref name=\"Donald J.

He was sworn in as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]] and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired [[Robert Burnaby]] as his personal secretary.\n\nIn British Columbia, Moody \"wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness\" and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, \"styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe\".<ref name=\"scott26\">{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Laura Elaine |title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |year=1983 |page=26}}</ref> Subsequent to the enactment of the ''Pre-emption Act'' of 1860, Moody settled the [[Lower Mainland]].

He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \"Mary Hill\" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated \"government reserves\", which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The ''Pre-emption Act'' did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.\n\nBy 1862, the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]]) up the [[Fraser Canyon]] to the prospecting region around [[Barkerville]]. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening [[sawmill]]s, and engaging in [[fishery|fishing]] and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of [[responsible government]] began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the [[New Westminster]] ''British Columbian'' and future [[Premier of British Columbia|premier]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]]. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally, the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor.\n\n===Later gold rushes===\n\nA series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] and [[Lillooet]], which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually [[Colony of British Columbia (1866\u201371)|succeeded in 1866]], when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] to form the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866\u201371)]], which was, in turn, succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1871.\n\n===Rapid growth and development===\n[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]] drives the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], November 7, 1885. Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]\n\nThe Confederation League, including such figures as [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]], and [[Robert Beaven]], led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). Several factors motivated this agitation, including the fear of annexation to the United States, the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush.\n\n[[File:Craigellachie (Gedenkstein).jpg|thumb|Memorial to the \"last spike\" in Craigellachie]]\nWith the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on July 20, 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled. The Treaty of Washington sent the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in 1871 and in 1903, the province's territory shrank again after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].\n\nPopulation in British Columbia continued to expand as the province's [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fishery|fishing]] sectors were developed. Mining activity was particularly notable throughout the Mainland, particularly in the [[Boundary Country]], in the [[Slocan Valley|Slocan]], in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]] around [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], the East Kootenay (the southeast corner of the province), the Fraser Canyon, the [[Cariboo District|Cariboo]], the [[Omineca Country|Omineca]] and the [[Cassiar Country|Cassiar]], so much so a common epithet for the Mainland, even after provincehood, was \"the Gold Colony\".<!--cite is the Akriggs, and Howay, and Ormsby, and others--> Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley, and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson River area, the Cariboo, the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]], and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.\n\nThe completion of the railway in 1885 was a huge boost to the province's economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, known as [[Gastown]], near the mouth of the [[Burrard Inlet]] was selected as the terminus of the railway, prompting the incorporation of the City as Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the [[Port of Vancouver]] spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], as the largest in [[Western Canada]]. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use\u2014specifically, its settlement and development\u2014were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources (such as the fishery).\n\n[[File:Statue of Queen Victoria, Victoria, Canada 02.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Statue of Queen Victoria (Victoria, British Columbia)|Statue of Queen Victoria]] outside the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]]]\nEstablishing a [[labor force|labour force]] to develop the province was problematic from the start, and British Columbia was the locus of immigration from Europe, China, Japan and India. The influx of a non-[[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation (much of it successful) to restrict the ability of [[Asian people]] to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of a [[Tax per head|head tax]]. This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. The subsequent [[Komagata Maru incident]] in 1914, where hundreds of Indians were denied entry into Vancouver, was also a direct result of the anti-Asian resentment at the time. By 1923, almost all [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese immigration had been blocked]] except for merchants, professionals, students and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the province continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line, the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk Pacific]], linking north-central British Columbia from the [[Yellowhead Pass]] through Prince George to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] was driven at [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]]. This opened up the [[British Columbia Coast|North Coast]] and the [[Bulkley Valley]] region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.\n\nIn [[World War I]], the province responded strongly to the call to assist the British Empire against its German foes in French and Belgian battlefields. About 55,570 of the 400,000 British Columbian residents, the highest per-capita rate in Canada, responded to the military needs. Horseriders from the province's Interior region and First Nations soldiers made contributions to Vimy Ridge and other battles. About 6,225 men from the province died in combat.<ref>British Columbia History magazine vol.48 no.2 Summer 2015, Book Review \u2013 From the West Coast to the Western Front: British Columbians and the Great War by Greg Dickson and Mark Forsythe</ref>\n\n===1920s to 1940s===\nWhen the men returned from the [[First World War]], they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hard-core drinking Vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war. Because of pressure from veterans, prohibition was quickly relaxed so the \"soldier and the working man\" could enjoy a drink, but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of \"soldier parties\" to represent their interests, variously named Soldier-Farmer, Soldier-Labour, and [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Farmer-Labour]] Parties. These formed the basis of the fractured labour-political spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties, including those who would eventually form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-operative Commonwealth]] and the early [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] splinter groups.\n[[File:Japanese internment camp in British Columbia.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Canadian internment|Internment camp]] for [[Japanese Canadians]] during [[World War II]]]]\n\nThe advent of [[prohibition in the United States]] created new opportunities, and many found employment or at least profit in cross-border liquor smuggling. Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this \"pirate economy\", although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. By the end of the 1920s, the end of prohibition in the U.S., combined with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], plunged the province into economic destitution during the 1930s. Compounding the already dire local economic situation, tens of thousands of men from colder parts of Canada swarmed into Vancouver, creating huge [[hobo]] jungles around [[False Creek]] and the Burrard Inlet [[Classification yard|rail yards]], including the old Canadian Pacific Railway mainline [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] through the heart of the [[Downtown Vancouver|city's downtown]] (at Hastings and Carrall). Increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts, an occupation of the main Post Office at [[Granville Street|Granville]] and [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of [[martial law]] on the docks for almost three years. A Vancouver contingent for the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] was organized and seized a train, which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a [[Gatling gun]] straddling the tracks at [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]; the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the Depression.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schroeder |first=Andreas |title=Carved From Wood; Mission, BC, 1861\u20131992'' |publisher=The Mission Foundation |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-55056-131-9}}</ref>\n\nThere were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce as never before.\n\nBritish Columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the Pacific Ocean to have close relations with [[East Asia]]. This closeness has often caused friction between cultures which has sometimes escalted into racist animosity towards those of Asian descent. This was most manifest during the Second World War when many people of [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese descent were relocated]] or interned in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior region]] of the province.\n\n===Coalition and the post-war boom===\n[[File:British Columbia Regiment 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own)|BC Regiment (DCOR)]], marching in [[New Westminster]], 1940]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the mainstream [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] and [[British Columbia Conservative Party|BC Conservative]] Parties of British Columbia united in a formal [[coalition government]] under new Liberal leader [[John Hart (Canadian politician)|John Hart]], who replaced [[Thomas Dufferin Pattullo|Duff Pattullo]] when the latter failed to win a majority in the [[1941 British Columbia general election|1941 election]]. While the Liberals won the most seats, they actually received fewer votes than the socialist [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). Pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival Conservatives led by [[Royal Maitland]] and was replaced by Hart, who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five Liberal and three Conservative ministers.<ref name=\"con\" /> The CCF was invited to join the coalition but refused.<ref name=\"con\" />\n\nThe pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of the Second World War was to prevent the CCF, which had won a surprise victory in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1944, from ever coming to power in British Columbia. The CCF's popular vote was high enough in the [[1945 British Columbia general election|1945 election]] that they were likely to have won three-way contests and could have formed government; however, the coalition prevented that by uniting the anti-[[socialism|socialist]] vote.<ref name=\"con\" /> In the post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the completion of [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] north of Prince George to the Peace River Block, a section called the John Hart Highway and also public hospital insurance.\n\nIn 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken over by [[Byron Ingemar Johnson]]. The Conservatives had wanted their new leader [[Herbert Anscomb]] to be premier, but the Liberals in the Coalition refused. Johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in British Columbia history (61%) in the [[1949 British Columbia general election|1949 election]]. This victory was attributable to the popularity of his government's spending programmes, despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power. During his tenure, major infrastructures continued to expand, such as the agreement with [[Rio Tinto Alcan|Alcan Aluminum]] to build the town of [[Kitimat, British Columbia|Kitimat]] with an aluminum smelter and the large [[Kemano Generating Station|Kemano Hydro Project]].<ref>{{Cite journal |date=June 1952 |title=Boom in the Big Triangle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA102 |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=102\u2013107/246}}</ref> Johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the 1948 flooding of the Fraser Valley, which was a major blow to that region and to the province's economy.\n\nOn February 13, 1950, a [[1950 British Columbia B-36 crash|Convair B-36B crashed]] in northern British Columbia after jettisoning a [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|Mark IV]] [[atomic bomb]].

I think; BC referenda/plebiscites need a history/list article of their own--> prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a [[Ranked voting systems|preferential ballot]]), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%.\n\nThe Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA [[W. A. C. Bennett]], formed a [[minority government]] backed by the Liberals and Conservatives (with 6 and 4 seats respectively). Bennett began a series of fiscal reforms, preaching a new variety of [[populism]] as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development, laying the ground for a [[1953 British Columbia general election|second election in 1953]] in which the new Bennett regime secured a majority of seats, with 38% of the vote. Secure with that majority, Bennett returned the province to the first-past-the-post system thereafter, which is still in use.\n\n===1952\u20131960s===\nWith the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked on a phase of rapid [[economic development]]. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.\n\nDuring these two decades, the government [[Nationalization|nationalized]] British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity [[BC Hydro]]. [[West Kootenay Power and Light]] remained independent of BC Hydro, being owned and operated by [[Cominco]], though tied into the regional power grid. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in\u2014among others\u2014the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Columbia, and [[Nechako River]] watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to [[Kemano]], was to supply power to the [[Alcan Inc.]] aluminum smelter at [[Kitimat]], and was not part of the provincial power grid but [[Independent Power Producers in British Columbia|privately owned]]). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the [[Columbia River Treaty]] between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established [[BC Ferries]] as a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]], to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system, also supported by federal grants as being part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.\n\nVancouver and Victoria became cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and ''haute cuisine'' chefs flocked to its scenery and warmer temperatures, with the cultural and entrepreneurial community bolstered by many [[Draft dodgers]] from the United States. Tourism also played a role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a boost to British Columbia's economy, primarily because of exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nPolitically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the [[labour movement]], sharpened as so-called [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by Social Credit\u2014in opposition to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between [[hippie]]s and [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver mayor]] [[Tom Campbell (Canadian politician)|Tom Campbell]] was particularly legendary, culminating in the [[Gastown riots]] of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nOn August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector, but BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871\u20131986 |work=Elections BC |year=1998 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614185856/http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2007 |access-date=April 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) government under [[Dave Barrett]]. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} although changes to the accounting system makes it likely some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its \"[[two sets of books]]\", as WAC Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three-year (\"Thousand Days\") period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]], a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.\n\nPerceptions the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the [[1975 British Columbia general election|1975 general election]]. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[Bill Bennett]], was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the [[Ministry of Forests]], reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP\u2014notably the creation of the [[Whistler, British Columbia|Resort Municipality of Whistler]], whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.\n\nAlso during the \"MiniWac\" regime (a reference to his father's acronym, WAC) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were \"privatized\" in a mass giveaway of shares in the [[British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation]], \"BCRIC\", with the \"Brick shares\" soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several [[megaproject]]s meant to stimulate the economy and win votes \u2013 unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of [[Expo 86]], to which was tied the construction of the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] and Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the [[Doman Scandal]], in which the premier and millionaire backer Herb Doman were investigated for insider-trading and [[securities fraud]]. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.\n\n[[File:Coquilhalla Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Coquihalla Highway]] was one of the legacies of the [[Expo 86]] [[world's fair]], though creation of the [[toll road|toll highway]] sparked controversy.]]\n\nAs the province entered a sustained [[recession]], Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Henry Pybus Bell-Irving]], was forced to call Bennett to [[Government House (British Columbia)|Government House]] to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]] no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, Bennett won an unexpected majority.\n\nAfter several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|House]] was finally called and in the [[speech from the throne]] the Socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed \"restraint\", which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to \"motherhood\" issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people.\n\nThis became known as the 1983 [[Solidarity Crisis]], from the name of the [[Solidarity Coalition]], a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour]] forming a separate organization of unions, [[Operation Solidarity]], under the direction of [[Jack Munro]], then-President of the [[International Woodworkers of America]] (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt a [[general strike]] would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at [[Pacific Press Publishing Association|Pacific Press]] ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Bryan |title=Solidarity: The Rise and Fall of an Opposition in British Columbia |publisher=New Star Books |year=1987 |location=Vancouver}}</ref>\n\nA tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party [[grande dame]] [[Grace McCarthy]], and the charismatic but eccentric [[Bill Vander Zalm]].\n\nBill Vander Zalm became the new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a [[conflict of interest]] scandal following the sale of [[Fantasy Gardens]], a Christian and [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]] [[Amusement park|theme park]] built by the Premier, to [[Tan Yu]], a [[Filipino Chinese]] gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor [[Faye Leung (businesswoman)|Faye Leung]] of a party in the \"Howard Hughes Suite\" on the top two floors of the [[Bayshore Inn]], where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a [[bag of money]] in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and [[Rita Johnston]] became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor [[Mike Harcourt]].\n\nIn 1988, [[David Lam (real estate entrepreneur)|David Lam]] was appointed as British Columbia's twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor, and was the province's first Lieutenant-Governor of Chinese origin.\n\n===1990s to present===\n{{update|type=section|date=August 2012}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\nJohnston lost the [[1991 British Columbia general election|1991 general election]] to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the province's growing [[tourism]] sector, although the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over \"[[Bingogate]]\"\u2014a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. [[Glen Clark]], a former president of the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour|BC Federation of Labour]], was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the [[Fast Ferry Scandal]] involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the Premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by [[Dan Miller (Canadian politician)|Dan Miller]] who was in turn followed by [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] following a leadership convention.\n\nIn the 2001 general election [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]'s BC Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the \"fast ferries\" project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of [[BC Rail]] to CN Rail. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] during a vacation in Hawaii, but he still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 general election against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the [[2009 British Columbia general election|2009 provincial election]], marking the first time in 23 years a premier has been elected to a third term.\n\nThe province won a bid to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver and Whistler. As promised in his 2002 re-election campaign, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell staged a non-binding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the Olympics. In February 2003, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wallechinsky |first=D. |title=The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics: 2010 Edition |last2=Loucky |first2=J. |year=2010 |page=12}}</ref>\n[[File:Christy Clark by Kris Krug 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Christy Clark was Premier of British Columbia from 2011 until 2017.]]\nAfter the Olympic joy had faded, Campbell's popularity started to fall. His management style, the implementation of the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) against election promises and the cancelling of the [[BC Legislature Raids|BC Rail corruption trial]] lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support. He would resign in November 2010 and call on the party to elect a new leader.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-premier-campbell-stepping-down-1.911669 |title=BC Premier Campbell stepping down |date=November 3, 2010 |access-date=May 22, 2014 |publisher=[[CBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2011, former Deputy Premier [[Christy Clark]] became leader of the Liberal Party. Though she was not a sitting MLA, she went on to win the seat left vacant by Campbell. For the next two years, she attempted to distance herself from the unpopularity of Campbell and forge an image for [[2013 British Columbia general election|the upcoming 2013 election]]. Among her early accomplishments were raising the minimum wage, creating a new statutory holiday in February called \"Family Day\", and pushing the development of BC's [[liquified natural gas]] industry. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP by a double-digit gap in the polls, but were able to achieve a surprise victory on election night, winning a majority and making Clark the first elected woman premier in BC history.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/christy-clark-leads-b-c-liberals-to-surprise-majority-1.1315526 |title=Christy Clark leads BC Liberals to surprise majority |date=May 15, 2013 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate [[David Eby]], she later won a by-election in the riding of [[Westside-Kelowna]]. Her government would go on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]].\n[[File:John Horgan 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|John Horgan has been Premier of British Columbia since 2017.]]\n\nIn [[2017 British Columbia general election|the 2017 election]], the NDP formed a minority government with the support of the Green Party through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence and supply agreement]]. The NDP and Green caucuses together control 44 seats, compared to the Liberals' 43. On July 18, 2017, NDP leader John Horgan was officially sworn in as premier of British Columbia. He was the province's first NDP premier in 16 years.\n\nBritish Columbia was also significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to [[China]]. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades,{{when|date=January 2019}} because of its natural environment, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but has been particularly true during periods of economic growth.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} British Columbia has moved from approximately 10% of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13% in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean the [[Greater Vancouver]] area now includes 51% of the province's population, followed by [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] with 8%. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.\n\nBy 2018, housing prices Vancouver were the second-least affordable in the world, behind only Hong Kong.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/hong-kong-housing-ranked-world-s-least-affordable-for-9th-year</ref> Many experts point to evidence of money-laundering from mainland China as a contributing factor. The high price of residential real estate has led to the implementation of an empty homes tax, a housing speculation and vacancy tax, and a foreign buyers' tax on housing.<ref>https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Gaming_Final_Report.pdf</ref>\n\nThe net number of people coming to BC from other [[province]]s has grown almost four times larger since 2012. BC was the largest net recipient of [[Interprovincial migration in Canada|interprovincial migrants in Canada]] in the first quarter of 2016 with half of the 5,000 people coming from [[Alberta]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/canadians-flock-to-b-c-in-search-of-jobs |title=Canadians flock to B.C. in search of jobs |last=Carman |first=Tara |date=August 5, 2016 |website=The Vancouver Sun |access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Canada British Columbia Density 2016.png|thumb|right|Population density of British Columbia]]\n{{Main|Demographics of British Columbia}}\n{{See also|List of cities in Canada#British Columbia|List of communities in British Columbia|List of municipalities in British Columbia}}\n\n=== Population ===\nWith an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2020, it is Canada's third-most populous province.\n{{Graph:Chart\n | width = 300\n | height= 200\n | type = line\n | interpolate = basis\n | xType = date\n | xAxisAngle = -40\n | yAxisTitle = Population\n | yGrid = yes\n | linewidth = 2\n | x = 1851, 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1975, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016\n | y = 55000, 51524, 36247, 49459, 98173, 178657, 392480, 524582, 694263, 817861, 1165210, 1398464, 1629082, 1873674, 2184620, 2466610, 2744467, 2883370, 3282061, 3724500, 3907738, 4113487, 4400057, 4648055\n | colors = #f47f28\n}}\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo62k.htm |title=Statistics Canada&nbsp;\u2013 Population |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519055145/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo62k.htm |archive-date=May 19, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060927/d060927a.htm |title=Canada's population |publisher=Statistics Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104230200/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060927/d060927a.htm |archive-date=November 4, 2008 |access-date=September 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Cities====\n[[File:Vancouver ib.jpg|thumb|The Vancouver skyline]]\n{{See also|List of cities in British Columbia|List of metropolitan areas in British Columbia|List of municipalities in British Columbia|List of regional districts of British Columbia}}\nHalf of all British Columbians live in the Metro Vancouver area, which includes Vancouver, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[New Westminster]], [[West Vancouver]], [[North Vancouver (city)]], [[North Vancouver (district municipality)]], [[Burnaby]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Port Coquitlam]], [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]], [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley (city)]], [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley (district municipality)]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Pitt Meadows]], [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Port Moody]], [[Anmore]], [[Belcarra]], [[Lions Bay, British Columbia|Lions Bay]] and [[Bowen Island]], with adjacent unincorporated areas (including the [[University Endowment Lands]]) represented in the regional district as the [[List of regional district electoral areas in British Columbia|electoral area]] known as [[Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A, British Columbia|Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A]].

Its climate encourages [[outdoor recreation]] and [[tourism]], though its economic mainstay has long been [[resource extraction]], principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city, serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average. While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada. The [[Interior of British Columbia|Northern Interior]] region has a [[subarctic climate]] with very cold winters. The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities, with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1 |title=Canadian climate normals 1981\u20132010 Vancouver International Airport |publisher=Environment Canada |access-date=October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBritish Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining.

In practice, this is usually the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|Chief Justice of British Columbia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBritish Columbia has an 87-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the [[plurality voting system]], though from 2003 to 2009 there was significant debate about switching to a [[single transferable vote]] system called [[BC-STV]]. The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios, what are officially part of the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]], of whom the premier is chair.\n\nThe province is governed by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (BC NDP) under Premier [[John Horgan]]. The 2017 provincial election saw the Liberal Party take 43 seats, the NDP take 41, and the [[British Columbia Green Party]] take 3. No party met the minimum of 44 seats for a majority, therefore leading to the first minority government since 1953. Following the election, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP, eventually announcing they would support the current NDP minority. Previously, the right-of-centre [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] governed the province for 16 years between 2001 and 2017, and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats. The legislature became more evenly divided between the Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 Liberal seats of 79) and 2009 (49 Liberal seats of 85) provincial elections. The NDP and its predecessor the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have ruled with majority governments in 1972\u20131975 and 1991\u20132001. The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. After a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39%), the party's vote share declined (2005 \u2013 9.17%, 2009 \u2013 8.09%, 2013 \u2013 8.13%) before increasing again to a record high of 16.84% at the 2017 election.\n\nThe British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been [[third party (politics)|third parties]] present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Green Party]] are the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.\n\nPrior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.\n\n[[File:BC-Legislative-Assembly-Chamber.jpg|thumb|The meeting chamber of the Legislative Assembly]]\nBritish Columbia is known for having politically active labour [[trade union|unions]] who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.\n\nBritish Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to [[McGowan's War]] in 1858\u201359). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the [[Robert Bonner (politician)|Robert Bonner]] Affair and the [[Fantasy Gardens]] scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era. NDP scandals included Bingogate, which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals plagued the 2001\u20132017 Liberal government, including Premier Gordon Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A Christmas Eve{{which|date=April 2015}} [[BC Legislature Raids|raid on the Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}{{Update inline|date=February 2020}} Campbell eventually resigned in late 2010 due to opposition to his government's plan to introduce a [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) and was replaced by [[Christy Clark]] as premier in a 2011 BC Liberal leadership election.\n\nBritish Columbia is underrepresented in the [[Senate of Canada]], leading Premier Christy Clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal government's reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use non-partisan criteria. Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December 3, 2015, Clark issued a statement that it did \"not address what's been wrong with the Senate since the beginning\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Gloria |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-setting-up-advisory-board-to-fill-empty-senate-seats/article27577333/ |title=Liberals to set up advisory board for Senate nominees, but BC won't take part |date=December 3, 2015 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=December 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe imbalance in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size.

The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around [[Cape Horn]] or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.\n\nUntil the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the [[Crowsnest Highway|Crowsnest Pass Highway]]), and later the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.\n\n===Roads and highways===\n{{Main|List of British Columbia provincial highways}}\n[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge from below.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] on [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] between Richmond and Delta]]\nBecause of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now [[controlled-access highway|freeways]] in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane [[arterial road|arterial highways]] with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.\n[[File:Highway 1, Burnaby.jpg|alt=|thumb|British Columbia Highway 1 near Brentwood, Burnaby]]\nA couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median [[traffic barrier]]s. [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] on [[Vancouver Island]] and Highway 97 through the [[Okanagan Valley]] are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from 50&nbsp;km/h to maximums just slightly lower than the principal [[grade-separated]] highways. Numerous [[traffic light]]s operate in place of [[interchange (road)|interchanges]] on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] and Infrastructure.<ref name=\"BC highways\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/tran/ |title=BC highways |work=BC ministry of transportation and infrastructure |year=2013 |access-date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: [[British Columbia provincial highway 3|BC Highway 3]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], the [[Vermilion Pass]] (Highway 93 in both [[British Columbia Highway 93|British Columbia]] and [[Alberta Highway 93|Alberta]]), the [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through [[Banff National Park]], the [[Yellowhead Highway]] (16) through [[Jasper National Park]], and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] through [[Dawson Creek]]. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running {{convert|2081|km|abbr=on}} from the British Columbia-Washington border at [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] north to [[Watson Lake, Yukon]] and which includes the British Columbia portion of the [[Alaska Highway]].\n\n===Public transit===\nPrior to 1979, surface [[public transport|public transit]] was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established [[BC Transit]] to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, now [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District, was established. Some smaller island communities, such as [[Gabriola Island]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gabriolacommunitybus.com/about/history/ |title=History: GERTIE: Gabriola's Environmentally Responsible Trans Island Express |website=GERTIE |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref> and, formerly, [[Pender Island]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://penderbus.org/about |title=About the Bus |website=Pender Island Community Bus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113210800/http://penderbus.org/about |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |title=Community Bus Pilot Project Ending |website=Pender Island Community Bus |publisher=Pender Island Community Bus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110235046/http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |archive-date=January 10, 2019 |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> operate routes independent of BC Transit or TransLink.

There is planning for an extension of the Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the [[University of British Columbia]]. Turnstiles have been added to all existing stations in the system.

Two major routes through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway \u2013 the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], terminating at [[Prince Rupert]], and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], terminating at Vancouver.\n\nThe [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] provided rail services in Victoria and Vancouver between the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century.\n\nThe [[Pacific Great Eastern]] line supplemented this service, providing a north\u2013south route between interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] with [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]]. The E&N Railway, rebranded as [[Southern Railway of Vancouver Island]], formerly served the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island. Service along the route is now minimal. Vancouver Island was also host to the [[Englewood Railway|last logging railway in North America]] until its closure in 2017.\n\nCurrent passenger services in British Columbia are limited. [[Via Rail Canada]] operates six long distance trains on two lines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/VIARail_Timetable.pdf |title=Via Rail Timetable |website=Via Rail Canada |publisher=Via Rail Canada |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> Local services are limited to two regions, with [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] providing rapid transit and commuter services in the [[Lower Mainland]] and by the [[Seton Lake Indian Band]] South of [[Lillooet]] with the [[Kaoham Shuttle]].

It now operates 25 routes among the [[List of islands of British Columbia|islands of British Columbia]], as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the [[Washington State Ferries]] (between [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]]) and [[MV Coho|Black Ball Transport]] (between Victoria and [[Port Angeles, Washington]]). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the provincial government. Various other coastal ferries are operated privately.\n\nCommercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are at Vancouver, [[Roberts Bank]] (near [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]), [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], and Victoria.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 |title=International Shipping in British Columbia |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729172613/http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 |archive-date=July 29, 2013 |access-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/images/docs/BCPortsHandbook2014.pdf |title=''BC Ports handbook'' |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC}}</ref>\nOf these, the [[Port of Vancouver]] is the most important, being the largest in Canada and the most diversified in North America.\n\nVancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for [[cruise ship]]s. In 2007, a large maritime [[Containerization|container port]] was opened in [[Prince Rupert Port Authority|Prince Rupert]] with an inland sorting port in Prince George.\n\n===Air===\n{{Main|List of airports in British Columbia}}\nThere are over 200 airports throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the [[Vancouver International Airport]], the [[Victoria International Airport]], the [[Kelowna International Airport]], and the [[Abbotsford International Airport]], the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. {{As of|2017}}, Vancouver International Airport is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|2nd busiest airport]] in the country and the second biggest International Gateway on the west coast (after Los Angeles) with an estimated 17.9&nbsp;million travellers passing through in 2008.\n\n==Outdoor life==\n[[File:Whistler ice sailor.jpg|thumb|Ice sailing in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]]]\n[[File:Holland Point Shoreline Trail, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada 05.jpg|thumb|Shoreline Trail in Victoria]]\nGiven its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].\n\nWater sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. [[Sea kayak]]ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its [[fjord]]s. [[Whitewater]] [[rafting]] and [[kayak]]ing are popular on many inland rivers. [[Sailing]] and [[Windsurfing|sailboarding]] are widely enjoyed.\n\nIn winter, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] and [[telemark skiing]] are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] [[skiing]] has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the [[Columbia Mountains]]. [[Snowboarding]] has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] downhill events were held in [[Whistler Blackcomb]] area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.\n\nIn Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for [[jogging|joggers]] and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the [[Bicycle gearing|ten-speed]] bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust [[mountain bike]], trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. A 2016 poll on global biking website Pinkbike rated BC as the top destination mountain bikers would like to ride.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pinkbike.com/news/where-would-you-go-if-you-could-road-trip-anywhere-pinkbike-poll-2016.html |title=Where would you go, if you could road trip anywhere? \u2013 Pinkbike Poll |work=Pinkbike |access-date=March 2, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. [[Longboarding]] is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.\n\n[[Equestrianism|Horseback riding]] is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for [[trail riding]], often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.\n\nBritish Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[curling]], [[disc golf]], [[Ultimate Canada|Ultimate]] and [[figure skating]]. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and [[winter sport]]s.\n\nConsistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of [[Luxury resort|lodges]], [[chalet]]s, [[bed and breakfast]]s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.\n\nIn certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting [[ecotourism]] in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the [[WWOOF]] Canada program.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wwoof.ca/ |title=WWOOF&nbsp;\u2013 Willing Workers on Organic Farms, Canada}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:SFU Aerial.jpg|alt=|thumb|Aerial view of [[Simon Fraser University]] in Burnaby]]\n{{see also|Higher education in British Columbia}}\nPublic universities and colleges include:\n{{col div}}\n* [[University of British Columbia]]\n* [[Simon Fraser University]]\n* [[University of Victoria]]\n* [[University of Northern British Columbia]]\n* [[Vancouver Island University]]\n* [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]\n* [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]]\n* [[Thompson Rivers University]]\n* [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]]\n* [[Royal Roads University]]\n* [[Capilano University]]\n* [[University of the Fraser Valley]]\n* [[Douglas College]]\n* [[Camosun College]]\n* [[Langara College]]\n* [[Selkirk College]]\n* [[College of New Caledonia]]\n* [[College of the Rockies]]\n* [[Okanagan College]]\n* [[Coast Mountain College]]\n{{col div end}}\nIn September 2014 there were 11,000 international students in BC public K-12 schools and about 3,000 international students in other BC K-12 schools.<ref>Sherlock, Tracy. \"[https://vancouversun.com/business/school+shutdown+China+concerned/10193719/story.html BC school shutdown has China 'concerned'].\" ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''.
