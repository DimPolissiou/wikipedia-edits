The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Tom Hanks]], with [[Christopher Walken]], [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Nathalie Baye]] in supporting roles. The film is based on the life of [[Frank Abagnale]], who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed tons worth millions of dollars by posing as a [[Pan American World Airways]] pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] prosecutor. His foremost crime was [[check fraud]]; he became so highly skilled that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] later turned to him for help catching other check forgers.\n\nDevelopment for the film began in 1980 but dragged on until 1997, when Spielberg's [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] bought the film rights to [[Catch Me If You Can (book)|Abagnale's book]]. [[David Fincher]], [[Gore Verbinski]], [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]], [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] and [[Cameron Crowe]] were all considered to direct the film before Spielberg decided to direct it himself. Filming took place from February to May 2002. \n\nThe film opened on December 25, 2002 to critical and commercial success. At the [[75th Academy Awards]], Christopher Walken and John Williams were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/2003 |title=74th Academy Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=July 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not expand the plot summary any further. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. It already exceeds that.-->\nIn 1963, teenager [[Frank Abagnale]] lives in [[New Rochelle, New York]] with his father Frank Abagnale, Sr., and French mother, Paula. When Frank Sr. encounters tax problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], his family is forced to move from their large home to a small apartment. Paula carries on an affair with Jack Barnes, her husband's friend. Meanwhile, Frank has to transfer to public school and gets into trouble when he begins posing as a substitute French teacher on his first day there. Frank runs away when his parents divorce. Needing money, he turns to confidence scams to survive, and his cons grow bolder. He impersonates an airline pilot and forges [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] payroll checks. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, [[FBI]] agent Carl Hanratty begins tracking Frank. Carl finds Frank at a hotel, but Frank cons Carl into believing he is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent who is also after the fraudster, and escapes before Carl realizes that he was fooled.\n\nMeanwhile, Frank's cons now include impersonating a doctor and a lawyer. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital worker. He asks Brenda's attorney father for permission to marry her, and also wants his help with arranging to take the [[Louisiana State Bar Association|Louisiana State Bar]] exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda's engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window minutes before Carl reaches him. Before leaving, Frank asks Brenda to meet him at the Miami airport two days later. At the airport, Frank sees Brenda, but also spots plainclothes agents everywhere; realizing Brenda betrayed him, he escapes on a flight to Europe.\n\nCarl tracks down Frank in [[Montrichard]], France, the small town from which Frank's mother came. Carl arrests Frank and returns him to the U.S. Prior to landing, Carl informs Frank that Frank's father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane and goes to where his mother and stepfather live. As the police arrive, Frank surrenders. He is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum security prison. Carl occasionally visits him. During one visit, Carl shows Frank a check from a case he is working on, and Frank immediately identifies that the bank teller was involved. Carl then convinces the FBI to allow Frank to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI bank fraud unit. But Frank finds the work tedious and restrictive and misses his former life. One weekend, he attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is intercepted by Carl, who wants Frank to return to the FBI on Monday and assures Frank that no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl grows nervous when Frank has not yet arrived at the office. However, Frank eventually shows up, and they discuss their next case.\n\nThe ending credits reveal that Frank is real and has been married for 26 years, has three sons, lives in the Midwest and has maintained a friendship with Carl. He now earns millions of dollars as a bank security expert, has designed secure bank checks and has helped apprehend numerous counterfeiters.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:08catchme.jpg|right|thumb|Leonardo DiCaprio and the real [[Frank Abagnale]]]]\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Frank Abagnale]]\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Carl Hanratty, based on [[Joseph Shea (FBI agent)|Joseph Shea]]\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Frank Abagnale Sr.\n* [[Nathalie Baye]] as Paula Abagnale\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Brenda Strong\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Roger Strong\n* [[James Brolin]] as Jack Barnes\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as Carol Strong\n\n[[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]], [[Frank John Hughes]], and [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] portray FBI agents.

Spielberg \"wanted to continue to have that connection where Frank kept trying to please his father; by making him proud of him; by seeing him in the uniform, the Pan-American uniform.\" Abagnale praised the idea, saying, \"Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room and I would just think of my mom and dad and fantasize about getting them back together again, and cry.

The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Tom Hanks]], with [[Christopher Walken]], [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Nathalie Baye]] in supporting roles. The film is based on the life of [[Frank Abagnale]], who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a [[Pan American World Airways]] pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] prosecutor. His foremost crime was [[check fraud]]; he became so highly skilled that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] later turned to him for help catching other check forgers.\n\nDevelopment for the film began in 1980 but dragged on until 1997, when Spielberg's [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] bought the film rights to [[Catch Me If You Can (book)|Abagnale's book]]. [[David Fincher]], [[Gore Verbinski]], [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]], [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] and [[Cameron Crowe]] were all considered to direct the film before Spielberg decided to direct it himself. Filming took place from February to May 2002. \n\nThe film opened on December 25, 2002 to critical and commercial success. At the [[75th Academy Awards]], Christopher Walken and John Williams were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/2003 |title=74th Academy Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=July 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not expand the plot summary any further. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. It already exceeds that.-->\nIn 1963, teenager [[Frank Abagnale]] lives in [[New Rochelle, New York]] with his father Frank Abagnale, Sr., and French mother, Paula. When Frank Sr. encounters tax problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], his family is forced to move from their large home to a small apartment. Paula carries on an affair with Jack Barnes, her husband's friend. Meanwhile, Frank has to transfer to public school and gets into trouble when he begins posing as a substitute French teacher on his first day there. Frank runs away when his parents divorce. Needing money, he turns to confidence scams to survive, and his cons grow bolder. He impersonates an airline pilot and forges [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] payroll checks. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, [[FBI]] agent Carl Hanratty begins tracking Frank. Carl finds Frank at a hotel, but Frank cons Carl into believing he is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent who is also after the fraudster, and escapes before Carl realizes that he was fooled.\n\nMeanwhile, Frank's cons now include impersonating a doctor and a lawyer. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital worker. He asks Brenda's attorney father for permission to marry her, and also wants his help with arranging to take the [[Louisiana State Bar Association|Louisiana State Bar]] exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda's engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window minutes before Carl reaches him. Before leaving, Frank asks Brenda to meet him at the Miami airport two days later. At the airport, Frank sees Brenda, but also spots plainclothes agents everywhere; realizing Brenda betrayed him, he escapes on a flight to Europe.\n\nCarl tracks down Frank in [[Montrichard]], France, the small town from which Frank's mother came. Carl arrests Frank and returns him to the U.S. Prior to landing, Carl informs Frank that Frank's father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane and goes to where his mother and stepfather live. As the police arrive, Frank surrenders. He is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum security prison. Carl occasionally visits him. During one visit, Carl shows Frank a check from a case he is working on, and Frank immediately identifies that the bank teller was involved. Carl then convinces the FBI to allow Frank to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI bank fraud unit. But Frank finds the work tedious and restrictive and misses his former life. One weekend, he attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is intercepted by Carl, who wants Frank to return to the FBI on Monday and assures Frank that no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl grows nervous when Frank has not yet arrived at the office. However, Frank eventually shows up, and they discuss their next case.\n\nThe ending credits reveal that Frank is real and has been married for 26 years, has three sons, lives in the Midwest and has maintained a friendship with Carl. He now earns millions of dollars as a bank security expert, has designed secure bank checks and has helped apprehend numerous counterfeiters.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:08catchme.jpg|right|thumb|Leonardo DiCaprio and the real [[Frank Abagnale]]]]\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Frank Abagnale]]\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Carl Hanratty, based on [[Joseph Shea (FBI agent)|Joseph Shea]]\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Frank Abagnale Sr.\n* [[Nathalie Baye]] as Paula Abagnale\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Brenda Strong\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Roger Strong\n* [[James Brolin]] as Jack Barnes\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as Carol Strong\n\n[[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]], [[Frank John Hughes]], and [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] portray FBI agents.

However the ''Shirakumo'' class had four boilers and four funnels, and was closer to the 'special' three-funnel destroyer [[HMS Albatross (1898)|''Albatross'']] built for the Royal Navy. Both vessels had a [[flush deck]] design with a distinctive \"turtleback\" [[forecastle]] that was intended to clear water from the bow during high speed navigation, but was poorly designed for high waves or bad weather. The bridge and forward gun platform were barely raised above the bow, resulting in a wet conning position. More than half of the small hull was occupied by the boilers and the engine room. With fuel and weaponry, there was little space left for crew quarters, although slightly more than in the ''Murakumo'' class.\n\nAll were powered by [[steam engine|triple expansion steam engines]] for {{convert|7000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and had [[coal|coal-fired]] [[water-tube boiler]]s.

It shares borders with [[Western Australia]] to the west ([[129th meridian east]]), [[South Australia]] to the south ([[26th parallel south]]), and [[Queensland]] to the east ([[138th meridian east]]). To the north, the territory looks out to the [[Timor Sea]], the [[Arafura Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], including [[Western New Guinea]] and other [[Indonesia]]n islands. The NT covers {{convert|1349129|km2|0}}, making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and [[List of country subdivisions by area|the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world]]. It is sparsely populated, with a population of only 245,800,<ref name=ABSPop/> fewer than half as many people as [[Tasmania]].<ref name=ABSPop/>\n\nThe archaeological [[history of the Northern Territory]] begins over 40,000 years ago when [[Indigenous Australians]] settled the region. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Makassan traders]] began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepang]] from at least the 18th century onwards. The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824\u201328, 1838\u201349, and 1864\u201366), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Port Darwin]]. Today the economy is based on tourism, especially [[Kakadu National Park]] in the [[Top End]] and the [[Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park]] (Ayers Rock) in central Australia, and mining.\n\nThe capital and largest city is [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. The population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the [[Stuart Highway]]. The other major settlements are (in order of size) [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], [[Nhulunbuy]] and [[Tennant Creek]]. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known simply as \"Territorians\" and fully as \"Northern Territorians\", or more informally as \"Top Enders\" and \"Centralians\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thomas Baines, Thomas Baines with Aborigines near the mouth of the Victoria River, N.T, 1857.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Baines]] with Aborigines near the mouth of the [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].]]\n{{main|History of the Northern Territory}}\n[[Indigenous Australians]] have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory for at least 65,000 years,<ref name=\"Clarkson Jacobs Marwick Fullagar 2017 pp. 306\u2013310\">{{cite journal | last=Clarkson | first=Chris | last2=Jacobs | first2=Zenobia | last3=Marwick | first3=Ben | last4=Fullagar | first4=Richard | last5=Wallis | first5=Lynley | last6=Smith | first6=Mike | last7=Roberts | first7=Richard G. | last8=Hayes | first8=Elspeth | last9=Lowe | first9=Kelsey | last10=Carah | first10=Xavier | last11=Florin | first11=S.

The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial [[New South Wales]] from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of [[North Australia]]. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911. Under the administration of colonial South Australia, the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|overland telegraph]] was constructed between 1870 and 1872.\n\nFrom its establishment in 1869 the Port of Darwin was the major Territory supply for many decades.\n\nA railway was built between [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] between 1883 and 1889. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. [[Victoria River Downs Station|Victoria River Downs]] was at one time the largest [[cattle station]] in the world. Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]], Brocks Creek, Burundi, and copper was found at [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]].\n\nOn 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia and transferred to federal control. [[Alfred Deakin]] opined at this time \"To me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last.

This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The [[Bombing of Darwin]] occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin's World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.\n\nIn the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Records/a590549]{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2794315|title=Darwin and Northern Territory freight transport study|editor-first=|editor-last=Australia|date=30 April 1977|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|accessdate=30 April 2019|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)}}</ref> Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.\n\n[[Indigenous Australians]] had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the [[Gurindji strike|strike and walk off]] by the [[Gurindji people]] at [[Kalkaringi|Wave Hill Cattle Station]] in 1966. The federal government of [[Gough Whitlam#Prime Minister|Gough Whitlam]] set up [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|the Woodward Royal Commission]] in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Justice Woodward]]'s first report in July 1973 recommended that a [[Central Land Council]] and a [[Northern Land Council]] be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]] was eventually passed by the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977).\n\nIn 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical [[Cyclone Tracy]]. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately A$6.85 billion (2018 dollars),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|title=Inflation Calculator|access-date=19 July 2019|author=Reserve Bank of Australia}}</ref> and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.\n\nIn 1978 the territory was granted [[responsible government]], with a Legislative Assembly headed by a [[chief minister]]. The territory also publishes official notices in its own ''[[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette|Government Gazette]]''. The [[administrator of the Northern Territory]] is an official acting as the Queen's ''indirect'' representative in the territory.\n\nDuring 1995\u201396 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with [[Euthanasia in Australia#Legalisation in the Northern Territory|legal voluntary euthanasia]], until the Federal Parliament overturned [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|the legislation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|title=Select Committee on Euthanasia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302220134/http://nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|archivedate=2 March 2011|date=13 September 2007|publisher=Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory}}</ref>\nBefore the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr. [[Philip Nitschke]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Northern Territory 0216.svg|thumb|right|Northern Territory towns, settlements and [[List of highways in the Northern Territory|road network]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Northern Territory}}\n[[File:ISS036-E-029323 lrg.jpg|thumb|The northern coast of Australia is on the left with Melville Island in the lower right<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81847 |title=Fires around Darwin, Australia August 21, 2013 |website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>]]\nThere are many very small settlements scattered across the territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the [[Stuart Highway]], known to locals simply as \"the track\".\n\nThe Northern Territory is home to two spectacular natural rock formations, [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) and [[Kata Tjuta]] (The Olgas), which are sacred to the local Aboriginal peoples and which have become major tourist attractions.\n\nIn the northern part of the territory lies [[Kakadu National Park]], which features extensive [[wetland]]s and native wildlife. To the north of that lies the [[Arafura Sea]], and to the east lies [[Arnhem Land]], whose regional centre is [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]] on the Liverpool River delta.\nThere is an extensive series of river systems in the Northern Territory. These rivers include: the [[Alligator Rivers]], [[Daly River]], [[Finke River]], [[McArthur River]], [[Roper River]], [[Todd River]] and [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].

During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\n\nThe wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclones]] and [[monsoon]] rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when [[thunderstorms]] are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from {{convert|1800|to|2100|mm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe central region is the [[desert]] centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), and is [[semi-arid]] with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Seasons are more distinct in central Australia, with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost is recorded a few times a year. The region receives less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year.\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|48.3|C}} at [[Aputula, Northern Territory|Finke]] on 1 and 2 January 1960.

Based on the [[Westminster System]], it consists of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] which was created in 1974, replacing the [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]]. It also produces the [[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette]].\n\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.\n\nWhile this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated [[devolution]] of powers from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The [[Queen of Australia|Monarch]] is represented by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], who performs a role similar to that of a [[governors of the Australian states|state governor]].\n\nTwenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member [[Electoral district|electorates]].\n\nFor some years there has been [[Proposed Northern Territory statehood|agitation for full statehood]]. A [[1998 Northern Territory referendum|referendum]] of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a 'no' vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, as opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. But under the Australian Constitution, the federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three senators, rather than the 12 guaranteed to original states. (Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in [[New South Wales]] or [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister [[Shane Stone]], it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.<ref>{{cite video | title = ABC Lateline Discussion | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | medium = Current Affairs | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | location = Australia | airdate = 15 October 1998 | access-date = 10 February 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519013129/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | archive-date = 19 May 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Chief minister and cabinet===\nThe [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|chief minister]] is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a ''[[premier]]''). The chief minister is appointed by the [[administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]], who in normal circumstances appoints the leader of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The current chief minister is [[Michael Gunner]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. He replaced [[Adam Giles]] on 31 August 2016.\n\n===Administrator===\nThe Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978 under its own [[administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]] appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]]. The federal government, not the NT government, advises the governor-general on the appointment of the administrator, but by convention consults first with the Territory government. The current administrator is [[Vicki O'Halloran]].\n\n===Federal government===\n[[File:Children wave Australian flags during an Anzac Day parade in Palmerston, Australia, April 25, 2013, as U.S. Marines with the 1st Platoon, Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, Marine Rotational 130425-M-AL626-014.jpg|thumb|right|Children wave Australian flags during an [[Anzac Day]] parade in Palmerston]]\nThe Northern Territory is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] by two members in the House of Representatives and two members in the Senate. {{As of|2019|5}}, resulting from the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], [[Warren Snowdon]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) and [[Luke Gosling]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) serve in the House of Representatives, and [[Malarndirri McCarthy]] from the ALP and [[Sam McMahon]] from the [[Country Liberal Party]] serve in the Senate.\n\n===Local government===\nThe Northern Territory is divided into 17 [[Local government areas of the Northern Territory|local government areas]], including 11 shires and five municipalities. Shire, city and town councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Northern Territory parliament, such as road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.\n\n===Aboriginal land councils===\n[[File:Australia Aboriginal Culture 011.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal Australians own about 49% of the Northern Territory's land]]\n{{Further|Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory}}\n[[Aboriginal land council]]s in the Northern Territory are groups of Aboriginal landowners, set up under the ''[[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]''.\n\n=== Political parties ===\nThe two dominant political parties in the Northern Territory are the [[conservative]] [[Country Liberal Party]], and the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Australian Labor Party]]. Minor parties that are also active in the NT are the [[Northern Territory Greens]], [[Palmer United Party]] and [[Australia's First Nations Political Party]]. In the [[2016 Northern Territory general election]] only two CLP representatives were elected (MLAs Higgins and Finocchiaro) plus five independents. This makes the parliamentary status of the CLP as a major party a matter of conjecture.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of Australia}}\n[[File:ABS-3101.0-AustralianDemographicStatistics-EstimatedResidentPopulationStatesTerritories-EstimatedResidentPopulation-Persons-NorthernTerritory-A2060849W.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Estimated resident population since 1981]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:.5em; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  style=\"background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Population estimates<br />for the Northern Territory\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1901 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4,765\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1956 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19,556\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1961 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 44,481\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1974 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 102,924\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1976 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 97,090\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1981 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 122,616\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1991 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 165,493\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1996 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 181,843\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2002 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 200,019\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2006 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 192,900\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2011 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 211,945\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2016 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 228,833\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"  style=\"font-size:80%; background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics<br />(Est Resident Pop)\n|}\n\nThe population of the Northern Territory at the 2011 Australian census was 211,945,<ref name=2011census>[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/7?opendocument&navpos=220 2011 Census QuickStats: Northern Territory], Australian Bureau of Statistics, 9 August 2011.</ref> a 10 per cent increase from the 2006 census.

ABS statistics suggest that Indigenous Australians die about 11 years earlier than the average non-Indigenous Australian. There are Aboriginal communities in many parts of the territory, the largest ones being the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] near [[Uluru]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] near Alice Springs, the [[Luritja]] between those two, the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] further north, and the [[Yolngu]] in eastern [[Arnhem Land]].\n\nMore than 54% of Territorians live in Darwin, located in the territory's north ([[Top End]]).

It was entitled \"A Pilot Implementation of [[Internet]] access for Remote [[Aboriginal]] Communities in the \"[[Top End]]\" of Australia. Which involved implementing an internet and email access programmes, to the four remote aboriginal communities of Milikapiti, Port Keats (Karudu Numida), Titjikala and Pirlangimpi. The overall project was a success; however, it did expose some areas of concern, such as the lack line of quality in numerous communities throughout the territory. This resulted in an inability to provide internet services to these communities. An upgrade in telecommunications infrastructure was thought to be the answer to resolve this issue.\n\nA letter was sent to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Communications, Information Technologies and the Arts Committee by Minister of Corporate and Information Services by [[Peter Toyne]] on 18 June 2002, enquiring into the opportunity of providing wireless technology to all Territorians. The letter highlighted the high cost of expanding the existing terrestrial broadband infrastructure (particularly in remote areas) and compared it to the fast and cheaper alternative of a wireless network. However, to be consider viable the wireless technology would have to be proven to be reliable and affordable to all Australians.\n\nThe Remote Areas Telecommunications Strategy for 2003\u20132008 was commended to the [[Commonwealth Government]] by Toyne. It focuses on delivering better telecommunication services to the indigenous residents of remote communities. It will also make such telecommunication services reliable and affordable, so that all Territorians have the ability and opportunity to partake in the information age. The government hopes to achieve these goals through the following strategies:\n* Equitable access: by delivering broadband services to remote communities, at the same cost of (within two years of introduction) the same Broadband services being provided in urban areas of Australia, and by developing infrastructure in one hundred and twenty remote communities throughout the Northern Territory. To provide quality large capacity telecommunication services to these areas over the five year period from 2003 to 2008.\n* Driving Demand: By providing education on consumer rights and responsibilities to the indigenous residents of remote communities. Targeting the indigenous residents of these remote communities by providing culturally appropriate content and applications. Also by improving private sector and government services to these remote communities.\n* Partnerships: Securing funding Territory wide to provide solutions to telecommunication infrastructure. Collaborating with indigenous organisations to develop, culturally appropriate content and applications, which will be utilised in the remote communities.\n* Efficient Delivery: Reducing the telecommunications cost to government, by forming agreements with local and remote community councils. Combining their access and demand needs to provide affordable telecommunication services.\n* Community Delivery: By supplying constant assistance in the remote communities by way of an entity or organisation, that assists the residents of the communities with any problems or issues. This entity or organisation could also liaise with the government, private sector and telecommunications organisations.\n\n# 4. An article in the N.T. Business review dated 13 December 2007 by [[Anastasia Govan]]. Entitled \"Broadband debate the key to NT's future\". In which Govan writes\" Despite all the noise about broadband during the weeks of the recent federal election, high speed telecommunications remain an elusive pipe dream for most of the Northern Territory\" (2007 p.007) Broadband debate key to NT's future. The article addresses the fact that the residents of remote Territory communities (most of whom are indigenous Australians) have little or no ability to access basic internet services. Such internet services are readily available in other states and taken for granted by most Australians. The gap in the quality of telecommunication services provided to the remote communities (if any in some cases), compared to the standard provided\n\nIn metropolitan areas of Australia is only getting bigger. To rectify this problem a strategy utilising both optical and wireless technologies is needed. To delivery these high speed broadband services to all Australians. As Govan (2007 p.007) (Broadband key to NT's future) states \"This issue must be addressed in the next six to two months if we are to maintain our global Competitiveness\". Australian's reputation as a nation of innovators and problem solvers is in peril, unless changes to telecommunication infrastructure are created and implemented.-->\n\n==Sport==\n{{main|Sport in the Northern Territory}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Australian Aboriginal prehistoric sites]]\n* [[Crime in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Index of Australia-related articles]]\n* [[Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Northern Territory Police]]\n* [[List of highways in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Cities in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Towns in the Northern Territory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Hill, Ernestine. 1951.

To the north, the territory looks out to the [[Timor Sea]], the [[Arafura Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], including [[Western New Guinea]] and other [[Indonesia]]n islands. The NT covers {{convert|1349129|km2|0}}, making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and [[List of country subdivisions by area|the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world]]. It is sparsely populated, with a population of only 245,800,<ref name=ABSPop/> fewer than half as many people as [[Tasmania]].<ref name=ABSPop/>\n\nThe archaeological [[history of the Northern Territory]] begins over 40,000 years ago when [[Indigenous Australians]] settled the region. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Makassan traders]] began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepang]] from at least the 18th century onwards. The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824\u201328, 1838\u201349, and 1864\u201366), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Port Darwin]]. Today the economy is based on tourism, especially [[Kakadu National Park]] in the [[Top End]] and the [[Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park]] (Ayers Rock) in central Australia, and mining.\n\nThe capital and largest city is [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. The population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the [[Stuart Highway]]. The other major settlements are (in order of size) [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], [[Nhulunbuy]] and [[Tennant Creek]]. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known simply as \"Territorians\" and fully as \"Northern Territorians\", or more informally as \"Top Enders\" and \"Centralians\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thomas Baines, Thomas Baines with Aborigines near the mouth of the Victoria River, N.T, 1857.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Baines]] with Aborigines near the mouth of the [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].]]\n{{main|History of the Northern Territory}}\n[[Indigenous Australians]] have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory for at least 65,000 years,<ref name=\"Clarkson Jacobs Marwick Fullagar 2017 pp. 306\u2013310\">{{cite journal | last=Clarkson | first=Chris | last2=Jacobs | first2=Zenobia | last3=Marwick | first3=Ben | last4=Fullagar | first4=Richard | last5=Wallis | first5=Lynley | last6=Smith | first6=Mike | last7=Roberts | first7=Richard G. | last8=Hayes | first8=Elspeth | last9=Lowe | first9=Kelsey | last10=Carah | first10=Xavier | last11=Florin | first11=S.

The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial [[New South Wales]] from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of [[North Australia]]. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911. Under the administration of colonial South Australia, the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|overland telegraph]] was constructed between 1870 and 1872.\n\nFrom its establishment in 1869 the Port of Darwin was the major Territory supply for many decades.\n\nA railway was built between [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] between 1883 and 1889. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. [[Victoria River Downs Station|Victoria River Downs]] was at one time the largest [[cattle station]] in the world. Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]], Brocks Creek, Burundi, and copper was found at [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]].\n\nOn 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia and transferred to federal control. [[Alfred Deakin]] opined at this time \"To me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last.

This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The [[Bombing of Darwin]] occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin's World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.\n\nIn the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Records/a590549]{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2794315|title=Darwin and Northern Territory freight transport study|editor-first=|editor-last=Australia|date=30 April 1977|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|accessdate=30 April 2019|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)}}</ref> Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.\n\n[[Indigenous Australians]] had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the [[Gurindji strike|strike and walk off]] by the [[Gurindji people]] at [[Kalkaringi|Wave Hill Cattle Station]] in 1966. The federal government of [[Gough Whitlam#Prime Minister|Gough Whitlam]] set up [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|the Woodward Royal Commission]] in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Justice Woodward]]'s first report in July 1973 recommended that a [[Central Land Council]] and a [[Northern Land Council]] be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]] was eventually passed by the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977).\n\nIn 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical [[Cyclone Tracy]]. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately A$6.85 billion (2018 dollars),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|title=Inflation Calculator|access-date=19 July 2019|author=Reserve Bank of Australia}}</ref> and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.\n\nIn 1978 the territory was granted [[responsible government]], with a Legislative Assembly headed by a [[chief minister]]. The territory also publishes official notices in its own ''[[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette|Government Gazette]]''. The [[administrator of the Northern Territory]] is an official acting as the Queen's ''indirect'' representative in the territory.\n\nDuring 1995\u201396 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with [[Euthanasia in Australia#Legalisation in the Northern Territory|legal voluntary euthanasia]], until the Federal Parliament overturned [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|the legislation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|title=Select Committee on Euthanasia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302220134/http://nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|archivedate=2 March 2011|date=13 September 2007|publisher=Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory}}</ref>\nBefore the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr. [[Philip Nitschke]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Northern Territory 0216.svg|thumb|right|Northern Territory towns, settlements and [[List of highways in the Northern Territory|road network]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Northern Territory}}\n[[File:ISS036-E-029323 lrg.jpg|thumb|The northern coast of Australia is on the left with Melville Island in the lower right<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81847 |title=Fires around Darwin, Australia August 21, 2013 |website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>]]\nThere are many very small settlements scattered across the territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the [[Stuart Highway]], known to locals simply as \"the track\".\n\nThe Northern Territory is home to two spectacular natural rock formations, [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) and [[Kata Tjuta]] (The Olgas), which are sacred to the local Aboriginal peoples and which have become major tourist attractions.\n\nIn the northern part of the territory lies [[Kakadu National Park]], which features extensive [[wetland]]s and native wildlife. To the north of that lies the [[Arafura Sea]], and to the east lies [[Arnhem Land]], whose regional centre is [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]] on the Liverpool River delta.\nThere is an extensive series of river systems in the Northern Territory. These rivers include: the [[Alligator Rivers]], [[Daly River]], [[Finke River]], [[McArthur River]], [[Roper River]], [[Todd River]] and [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]].

During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\n\nThe wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclones]] and [[monsoon]] rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when [[thunderstorms]] are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from {{convert|1800|to|2100|mm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe central region is the [[desert]] centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), and is [[semi-arid]] with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Seasons are more distinct in central Australia, with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost is recorded a few times a year. The region receives less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year.\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|48.3|C}} at [[Aputula, Northern Territory|Finke]] on 1 and 2 January 1960.

Based on the [[Westminster System]], it consists of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] which was created in 1974, replacing the [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]]. It also produces the [[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette]].\n\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.\n\nWhile this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated [[devolution]] of powers from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The [[Queen of Australia|Monarch]] is represented by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], who performs a role similar to that of a [[governors of the Australian states|state governor]].\n\nTwenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member [[Electoral district|electorates]].\n\nFor some years there has been [[Proposed Northern Territory statehood|agitation for full statehood]]. A [[1998 Northern Territory referendum|referendum]] of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a 'no' vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, as opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. But under the Australian Constitution, the federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three senators, rather than the 12 guaranteed to original states. (Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in [[New South Wales]] or [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister [[Shane Stone]], it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.<ref>{{cite video | title = ABC Lateline Discussion | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | medium = Current Affairs | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | location = Australia | airdate = 15 October 1998 | access-date = 10 February 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519013129/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm | archive-date = 19 May 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Chief minister and cabinet===\nThe [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|chief minister]] is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a ''[[premier]]'').

It was entitled \"A Pilot Implementation of [[Internet]] access for Remote [[Aboriginal]] Communities in the \"[[Top End]]\" of Australia. Which involved implementing an internet and email access programmes, to the four remote aboriginal communities of Milikapiti, Port Keats (Karudu Numida), Titjikala and Pirlangimpi. The overall project was a success; however, it did expose some areas of concern, such as the lack line of quality in numerous communities throughout the territory. This resulted in an inability to provide internet services to these communities. An upgrade in telecommunications infrastructure was thought to be the answer to resolve this issue.\n\nA letter was sent to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Communications, Information Technologies and the Arts Committee by Minister of Corporate and Information Services by [[Peter Toyne]] on 18 June 2002, enquiring into the opportunity of providing wireless technology to all Territorians. The letter highlighted the high cost of expanding the existing terrestrial broadband infrastructure (particularly in remote areas) and compared it to the fast and cheaper alternative of a wireless network. However, to be consider viable the wireless technology would have to be proven to be reliable and affordable to all Australians.\n\nThe Remote Areas Telecommunications Strategy for 2003\u20132008 was commended to the [[Commonwealth Government]] by Toyne. It focuses on delivering better telecommunication services to the indigenous residents of remote communities. It will also make such telecommunication services reliable and affordable, so that all Territorians have the ability and opportunity to partake in the information age. The government hopes to achieve these goals through the following strategies:\n* Equitable access: by delivering broadband services to remote communities, at the same cost of (within two years of introduction) the same Broadband services being provided in urban areas of Australia, and by developing infrastructure in one hundred and twenty remote communities throughout the Northern Territory. To provide quality large capacity telecommunication services to these areas over the five year period from 2003 to 2008.\n* Driving Demand: By providing education on consumer rights and responsibilities to the indigenous residents of remote communities. Targeting the indigenous residents of these remote communities by providing culturally appropriate content and applications. Also by improving private sector and government services to these remote communities.\n* Partnerships: Securing funding Territory wide to provide solutions to telecommunication infrastructure. Collaborating with indigenous organisations to develop, culturally appropriate content and applications, which will be utilised in the remote communities.\n* Efficient Delivery: Reducing the telecommunications cost to government, by forming agreements with local and remote community councils. Combining their access and demand needs to provide affordable telecommunication services.\n* Community Delivery: By supplying constant assistance in the remote communities by way of an entity or organisation, that assists the residents of the communities with any problems or issues. This entity or organisation could also liaise with the government, private sector and telecommunications organisations.\n\n# 4. An article in the N.T. Business review dated 13 December 2007 by [[Anastasia Govan]]. Entitled \"Broadband debate the key to NT's future\". In which Govan writes\" Despite all the noise about broadband during the weeks of the recent federal election, high speed telecommunications remain an elusive pipe dream for most of the Northern Territory\" (2007 p.007) Broadband debate key to NT's future. The article addresses the fact that the residents of remote Territory communities (most of whom are indigenous Australians) have little or no ability to access basic internet services. Such internet services are readily available in other states and taken for granted by most Australians. The gap in the quality of telecommunication services provided to the remote communities (if any in some cases), compared to the standard provided\n\nIn metropolitan areas of Australia is only getting bigger. To rectify this problem a strategy utilising both optical and wireless technologies is needed. To delivery these high speed broadband services to all Australians. As Govan (2007 p.007) (Broadband key to NT's future) states \"This issue must be addressed in the next six to two months if we are to maintain our global Competitiveness\". Australian's reputation as a nation of innovators and problem solvers is in peril, unless changes to telecommunication infrastructure are created and implemented.-->\n\n==Sport==\n{{main|Sport in the Northern Territory}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Australian Aboriginal prehistoric sites]]\n* [[Crime in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Index of Australia-related articles]]\n* [[Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Northern Territory Police]]\n* [[List of highways in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Cities in the Northern Territory]]\n* [[:Category:Towns in the Northern Territory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Hill, Ernestine. 1951.
