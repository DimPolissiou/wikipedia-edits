Charles was a gas engineer and inventor, born in Bedford, Bedfordshire on 23 March 1846.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nOn 17 December 1891, Samuel Rowbottom, of 82 Abbey Road, Derby, applied for a patent for his Automatic Tea Making Apparatus, the patent being granted in 1892. It used a clockwork alarm clock, a [[gas ring]] and [[pilot light]]. There is a photograph in existence of Rowbottom displaying his Automatic Tea Maker on an exhibition stand. Although there is no evidence that he commercially produced his tea maker, the concept he invented of using the steam from boiling water to force the water out through a tube into the teapot is still in use today.\n\nOn 7 April 1902, a patent for a teasmade was registered by gunsmith Frank Clarke of Birmingham, England. He called it \"An Apparatus Whereby a Cup of Tea or Coffee is Automatically Made\" and it was later marketed as \"A Clock That Makes Tea!\". However, his original machine and all rights to it were purchased from [[Albert E Richardson]], a clockmaker from Ashton-under-Lyne.\n\nOn 2 May 1932, George Absolom submitted an application for a patent on his invention, an electric automatic tea maker. The patent (number 400672) was passed on 2 November 1933. This invention was manufactured and marketed as the Teesmade.<ref name=\"Teesmade\"/>\n\nThe word \"teesmade\" was initiated by George Absolom Sr and predates the use of the word \"teasmade\" by about four years. George Absolom Sr. applied for a Registered Design using the name Teesmade, but this was not accepted by the Patent Office on the grounds that the unit was not made on the River Tees and that this might confuse the public. After he became ill and confined to his home in Chichester, his wife Blanche-Clementine Absolom took up a lengthy legal battle with the chambers of the Messrs Lovelace and Catwell who represented George Absolom Sr. in his own fight for a patent. Switching lawyers, she turned on her old lawyers for failing to represent her in the fiercer manner. She won the case, despite it dragging on for years due to poor funding on both sides. Geographic trademarks were invariably refused at this time, and indeed the Patent Office passed legislation to forbid them in 1938 (this legislation has since been relaxed). Although the name could not be formally protected, from 1932 onwards George Absolom Sr's son, George Edward Absolom continued to trade as Teesmade Co. Goblin were in no position to object, as the name had the indisputable advantage of prior use.\n\nA similar electric teamaker was patented by William Hermann Brenner Thornton in association with Goblin in 1933, shortly after Absolom's patent.<ref name=\"Thornton-1933\"/>\n\nGoblin's next model, also invented by William Hermann Brenner Thornton, was patented in 1934 and was manufactured from 1936.

Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded. During a 22-year growth period from 1945 to 1967, fifteen high schools were opened.\n\n;Philadelphia\n*[[Archbishop Ryan High School]], established 1966\n*[[Father Judge High School]], established 1954; administered by the [[Oblates of St. Francis de Sales]]\n*[[J.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jachts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most notable  of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is also important. \n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a [[Displacement\u2013length ratio|displacement to length ratio]] (D/L) of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Engine ===\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Auxilliary diesel yacht engine]]\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Target shaft horsepower for the engine per unit of displacement is related to hull speed per square root of waterline length all to the third power. Choice of engines is also a function of target propellor speed at cruise.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cumberlidge, Peter.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69013578|title=How to install a new diesel engine|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-224-3|edition=2nd ed|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=69013578}}</ref> A  {{Convert|31|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} sailboat might have a {{Convert|13|hp|kW|abbr=|adj=on}} engine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sailingmagazine.net/article-permalink-1464.html|title=Hunter 31|last=Liscio|first=David|date=May 5, 2014|website=Sailing Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> whereas a {{Convert|55|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} sailboat might have a {{Convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=|adj=on}} engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nautorswan.com/yachts/models/swan54/|title=Swan 54 Specification|last=|first=|date=|website=Nautor|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Systems ===\nElectrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jachts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most notable  of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is also important. \n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a [[Displacement\u2013length ratio|displacement to length ratio]] (D/L) of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Engine ===\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Auxilliary diesel yacht engine]]\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

They are often called hieroglyphs due to the iconic shapes of many of the glyphs, a pattern superficially similar to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Fifteen examples of distinct writing systems have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macri |first1=Martha J. |title=\"Maya and Other Mesoamerican Scripts,\" in The World's Writing Systems |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford |location=England |pages=172\u2013182}}</ref> The limits of archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was the earliest and hence the fore-bearer from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postconquest transcriptions in the [[Latin script]].\n\n== Pre-Classic and Classic Period ==\nIn Mesoamerica, writing emerged during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-classic Period]], with Zapotec and Maya writing flourishing during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Period|Classic Period]].\n\n=== Olmec writing ===\n{{Main|Cascajal block}}\n\n[[File:Cascajal-text.svg|thumb|right|upright|The 62 glyphs of the [[Cascajal block]]]]\n\nEarly [[Olmec]] ceramics show representations of something that may be codices, suggesting that [[amatl]] bark codices, and by extension well-developed writing, existed in Olmec times.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} It was also long thought that many of the glyphs present on Olmec monumental sculpture, such as those on the so-called \"Ambassador Monument\" (La Venta Monument 13), represented an early Olmec script. This suspicion was reinforced in 2002 by the announcement of the discovery of [[San_Andr\u00e9s_(Mesoamerican_site)#Indications_of_an_Olmec_writing_system|similar glyphs]] at [[San Andres (Mesoamerican site)|San Andres]].<ref>https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5600/1984/tab-figures-data</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, a report published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] announced the discovery of the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Cascajal block]], a writing-tablet-sized block of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 characters unlike any yet seen in Mesoamerica. This block was discovered by locals in the [[Olmec heartland]] and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 [[Common Era|BCE]] based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica.\n\n=== Zapotec writing ===\n[[File:C\u00f3dice_Vindobonensis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Line 37 of the C\u00f3dice Vindobonensis or Yuta Tnoho]]\nAnother candidate for earliest writing system in Mesoamerica is the writing system of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] culture. Rising in the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic era]] after the decline of the Olmec civilization, the Zapotecs of present-day Oaxaca built an empire around [[Monte Alban]]. On a few monuments at this archaeological site, archaeologists have found extended text in a glyphic script. Some signs can be recognized as calendric information but the script as such remains undeciphered. Read in columns from top to bottom, its execution is somewhat cruder than that of the later Classic Maya and this has led epigraphers to believe that the script was also less phonetic than the largely syllabic Maya script. These are, however, speculations.\n\nThe earliest known monument with Zapotec writing is a \"Danzante\" stone, officially known as Monument 3, found in [[San Jose Mogote]], [[Oaxaca]]. It has a relief of what appears to be a dead and bloodied captive with two glyphic signs between his legs, probably representing his name. First dated to 500\u2013600 BCE, this was earlier considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. However doubts have been expressed as to this dating and the monument may have been reused. The Zapotec script went out of use only in the late Classic period.\n\n=== Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script ===\n{{Main|Epi-Olmec script}}\n\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|right|Detail showing glyphs from 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] currently located at the Museum of Anthropology of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 162 CE. The other columns are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]\n\nA small number of artifacts found in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] show examples of another early Mesoamerican writing system. They can be seen to contain calendric information but are otherwise undeciphered. The longest of these texts are on [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] and the [[Tuxtla Statuette]]. The writing system used is very close to the Maya script, using affixal glyphs and Long Count dates, but is read only in one column at a time as is the Zapotec script. It has been suggested that this Isthmian or [[Epi-Olmec script]] is the direct predecessor of the Maya script, thus giving the Maya script a non-Maya origin. Another artifact with Epi-Olmec script is the Chiapa de Corzo stela which is the oldest monument of the Americas inscribed with its own date: the [[Maya calendar#Long Count|Long Count]] on the stela dates it to 36 BCE.\n\nIn a 1997 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman put forward a decipherment of Epi-Olmec. The following year, however, their interpretation was disputed by Stephen Houston and [[Michael D. Coe]], who unsuccessfully applied Justeson and Kaufman's decipherment system against epi-Olmec script from the back of a hitherto unknown mask. The matter remains under dispute.\n\n=== Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy\u00fa scripts ===\n\nIn the highland Maya archaeological sites of [[Abaj Takalik]] and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] writing has been found dating to [[Izapa]] culture. It is likely that in this area in late Pre-Classic times an ancient form of a [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] was spoken, and the inscriptions found here may be in such a language rather than a Maya one. Some glyphs in this scripts are readable as they are identical to Maya glyphs but the script remains undeciphered. The advanced decay and destruction of these archaeological sites make it improbable that more monuments with these scripts will come to light making possible a decipherment.\n\n=== Maya writing ===\n{{Main|Maya script}}\n\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Maya glyphs in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], Mexico]]\n\nMaya writing is attested from the mid-preclassic period in the center of Pet\u00e9n in the Maya lowlands, and lately scholars have suggested that the earliest Maya inscriptions may in fact be the oldest of Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 200\u2013300 BCE. Early examples include the painted inscriptions at the caves of [[Naj Tunich]] and La Cobanerita in [[El Pet\u00e9n]], [[Guatemala]]. The most elaborate inscriptions are considered to be those at classic sites like [[Palenque]], [[Cop\u00e1n]] and [[Tikal]].\n\nThe [[Maya script]] is generally considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system, mostly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it has been partially deciphered. In Maya writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs have been documented, with some 75% having been deciphered. Around 7000 texts in Maya script have been documented.\n\nMaya writing first developed as only utilizing logograms, but later included the use of phonetic complements in order to differentiate between the semantic meanings of the logograms and for context that allows for syllabic spelling of words.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=L. |last2=Kaufman |first2=T. |date=1985 |title=Maya Linguistics: Where Are We Now? |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=187\u2013198 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.14.100185.001155}}</ref>\n\nPost-classic inscriptions are found at the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in sites such as [[Chich\u00e9n Itza]] and [[Uxmal]] but the style is not nearly as accomplished as the classic Maya inscriptions.\n\n=== Other potential Mesoamerican writing systems ===\n\nAt least two other potential writing systems have been found in Mesoamerica: The Tlatilco cylinder seal was found during the time frame of the Olmec occupation of Tlatilco, and appears to contain a non-pictographic script. The Chiapa de Corzo cylinder seal found at that location in Mexico also appears to be an example of an unknown Mesoamerican script.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelley |first1=David H. |title=A Cylinder Seal from Tlatilco |journal=American Antiquity |date=1966 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=744\u201346|doi=10.2307/2694503 |jstor=2694503}}</ref>\n\nCertain iconographic elements in [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacano]] art have also been considered as a potential script,<ref name=\":0\">Taube, Karl A.

Other post-classic cultures such as the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]] did not have fully developed writing systems, but instead used [[semasiographic]] writing.\n\n=== Mixtec writing ===\n{{Main|Mixtec writing}}\n[[File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela_5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stela 5 from Abaj Takalik]]\nThe Mixtec writing emerged during the 13th century, much later than the systems previously mentioned. Mixtec is a [[Semasiography|semasiographic]] system that was used by the pre-Hispanic [[Mixtec]]s. Many of its characteristics were later adopted by the Mexica and Mixteca-Puebla writing systems. The origin of the Mixteca-Puebla is the subject of debate amongst experts. The [[Mixtec writing|Mixtec writing system]] consisted of a set of figurative signs and symbols that served as guides for storytellers as they recounted legends. These storytellers were usually priests and other members of the Mixtec upper class.\n\nMixtec writing has been categorized as being a mixture of pictorial and logographic, rather than a complete logogram system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kubler|first=George|date=1974|title=Review of Picture Writing from Ancient Southern Mexico: Mixtec Place Signs and Maps|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=76|issue=3|pages=670\u2013672|doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.3.02a00840|jstor=674740}}</ref>\n\nMixtec writing has been preserved through various archaeological artifacts that have survived the passage of time and the destruction of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pohl|first=John M.

This suspicion was reinforced in 2002 by the announcement of the discovery of [[San_Andr\u00e9s_(Mesoamerican_site)#Indications_of_an_Olmec_writing_system|similar glyphs]] at [[San Andres (Mesoamerican site)|San Andres]].<ref>https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5600/1984/tab-figures-data</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, a report published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] announced the discovery of the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Cascajal block]], a writing-tablet-sized block of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 characters unlike any yet seen in Mesoamerica. This block was discovered by locals in the [[Olmec heartland]] and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 [[Common Era|BCE]] based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica.\n\n=== Zapotec writing ===\n[[File:C\u00f3dice_Vindobonensis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Line 37 of the C\u00f3dice Vindobonensis or Yuta Tnoho]]\nAnother candidate for earliest writing system in Mesoamerica is the writing system of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] culture. Rising in the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic era]] after the decline of the Olmec civilization, the Zapotecs of present-day Oaxaca built an empire around [[Monte Alban]]. On a few monuments at this archaeological site, archaeologists have found extended text in a glyphic script. Some signs can be recognized as calendric information but the script as such remains undeciphered. Read in columns from top to bottom, its execution is somewhat cruder than that of the later Classic Maya and this has led epigraphers to believe that the script was also less phonetic than the largely syllabic Maya script. These are, however, speculations.\n\nThe earliest known monument with Zapotec writing is a \"Danzante\" stone, officially known as Monument 3, found in [[San Jose Mogote]], [[Oaxaca]]. It has a relief of what appears to be a dead and bloodied captive with two glyphic signs between his legs, probably representing his name. First dated to 500\u2013600 BCE, this was earlier considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. However doubts have been expressed as to this dating and the monument may have been reused. The Zapotec script went out of use only in the late Classic period.\n\n=== Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script ===\n{{Main|Epi-Olmec script}}\n\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|right|Detail showing glyphs from 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] currently located at the Museum of Anthropology of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 162 CE. The other columns are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]\n\nA small number of artifacts found in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] show examples of another early Mesoamerican writing system. They can be seen to contain calendric information but are otherwise undeciphered. The longest of these texts are on [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] and the [[Tuxtla Statuette]]. The writing system used is very close to the Maya script, using affixal glyphs and Long Count dates, but is read only in one column at a time as is the Zapotec script. It has been suggested that this Isthmian or [[Epi-Olmec script]] is the direct predecessor of the Maya script, thus giving the Maya script a non-Maya origin. Another artifact with Epi-Olmec script is the Chiapa de Corzo stela which is the oldest monument of the Americas inscribed with its own date: the [[Maya calendar#Long Count|Long Count]] on the stela dates it to 36 BCE.\n\nIn a 1997 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman put forward a decipherment of Epi-Olmec. The following year, however, their interpretation was disputed by Stephen Houston and [[Michael D. Coe]], who unsuccessfully applied Justeson and Kaufman's decipherment system against epi-Olmec script from the back of a hitherto unknown mask. The matter remains under dispute.\n\n=== Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy\u00fa scripts ===\n\nIn the highland Maya archaeological sites of [[Abaj Takalik]] and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] writing has been found dating to [[Izapa]] culture. It is likely that in this area in late Pre-Classic times an ancient form of a [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] was spoken, and the inscriptions found here may be in such a language rather than a Maya one. Some glyphs in this scripts are readable as they are identical to Maya glyphs but the script remains undeciphered. The advanced decay and destruction of these archaeological sites make it improbable that more monuments with these scripts will come to light making possible a decipherment.\n\n=== Maya writing ===\n{{Main|Maya script}}\n\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Maya glyphs in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], Mexico]]\n\nMaya writing is attested from the mid-preclassic period in the center of Pet\u00e9n in the Maya lowlands, and lately scholars have suggested that the earliest Maya inscriptions may in fact be the oldest of Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 200\u2013300 BCE. Early examples include the painted inscriptions at the caves of [[Naj Tunich]] and La Cobanerita in [[El Pet\u00e9n]], [[Guatemala]]. The most elaborate inscriptions are considered to be those at classic sites like [[Palenque]], [[Cop\u00e1n]] and [[Tikal]].\n\nThe [[Maya script]] is generally considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system, mostly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it has been partially deciphered. In Maya writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs have been documented, with some 75% having been deciphered. Around 7000 texts in Maya script have been documented.\n\nMaya writing first developed as only utilizing logograms, but later included the use of phonetic complements in order to differentiate between the semantic meanings of the logograms and for context that allows for syllabic spelling of words.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=L. |last2=Kaufman |first2=T. |date=1985 |title=Maya Linguistics: Where Are We Now? |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=187\u2013198 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.14.100185.001155}}</ref>\n\nPost-classic inscriptions are found at the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in sites such as [[Chich\u00e9n Itza]] and [[Uxmal]] but the style is not nearly as accomplished as the classic Maya inscriptions.\n\n=== Other potential Mesoamerican writing systems ===\n\nTwo other potential writing systems have been found in Mesoamerica. The Tlatilco cylinder seal was found during the time frame of the Olmec occupation of Tlatilco, and appears to contain a non-pictographic script. The Chiapa de Corzo cylinder seal found at that location in Mexico also appears to be an example of an unknown Mesoamerican script.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelley |first1=David H. |title=A Cylinder Seal from Tlatilco |journal=American Antiquity |date=1966 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=744\u201346|doi=10.2307/2694503 |jstor=2694503}}</ref>\n\nCertain iconographic elements in [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacano]] art are considered as a potential script,<ref name=\":0\">Taube, Karl A.

Other post-classic cultures such as the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]] did not have fully developed writing systems, but instead used [[semasiographic]] writing.\n\n=== Mixtec writing ===\n{{Main|Mixtec writing}}\n[[File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela_5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stela 5 from Abaj Takalik]]\nThe Mixtec writing emerged during the 13th century, much later than the systems previously mentioned. Mixtec is a [[Semasiography|semasiographic]] system that was used by the pre-Hispanic [[Mixtec]]s. Many of its characteristics were later adopted by the Mexica and Mixteca-Puebla writing systems. The origin of the Mixteca-Puebla is the subject of debate amongst experts. The [[Mixtec writing|Mixtec writing system]] consisted of a set of figurative signs and symbols that served as guides for storytellers as they recounted legends. These storytellers were usually priests and other members of the Mixtec upper class.\n\nMixtec writing has been categorized as being a mixture of pictorial and logographic, rather than a complete logogram system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kubler|first=George|date=1974|title=Review of Picture Writing from Ancient Southern Mexico: Mixtec Place Signs and Maps|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=76|issue=3|pages=670\u2013672|doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.3.02a00840|jstor=674740}}</ref>\n\nMixtec writing has been preserved through various archaeological artifacts that have survived the passage of time and the destruction of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pohl|first=John M.

The story was allegedly inspired by the discovery of unusually warm water in Antarctica in 1947. It starred [[Jock Mahoney]] and [[Shirley Patterson]] and was directed by [[Virgil W. Vogel]]. The film is notable for its low-budget special effects, which include men in dinosaur suits, puppets and [[monitor lizard]]s standing in for dinosaurs. [[William Reynolds (actor)|William Reynolds]] recalled the studio spent so much money on their mechanical dinosaur that they could not afford to shoot the film in colour as they first planned.<ref>There's Always Tomorrow</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA small crew led by Commander Harold Roberts and reporter Maggie Hathaway are on an expedition into [[Antarctica]] for the [[United States Navy]]. During a [[Sikorsky H-5|helicopter]] flight, they are called back to their ship via radio because of an unexpected storm approaching. At first they try to fly around the storm, but low on fuel, they fly into the storm, where they almost collide in mid-air with a man-sized [[pterosaur]]. Their rotor breaks and unable to stay in the air they start to descend, and are surprised when they end up landing well below [[sea-level]] in a warm [[volcanic crater]]. Inside, they discover a steamy tropical jungle populated by living [[dinosaur]]s, giant flesh-eating plants, and fresh human footprints. The crew encounter many dangers and perils in the jungle in a fight for survival.\n\nThe crew meet Hunter, the lone survivor of a plane crash from the 1947 expedition. He has learned to survive in this land with the aid of a [[conch]] that drives off the animals and by raiding the dinosaurs' nests. He offers the remains of his airplane to repair the helicopter, but only if the crew agree to leave Maggie with him. The crew refuses, but they also know that after 25 days their ship will have to leave before the Antarctic winter sets in. Unsuccessful in finding the remains of the plane, hidden by Hunter, the crew debate leaving Maggie, or forcing the information out of Hunter by torture. Commander Roberts refuses to sink to either low. Maggie is later attacked by an [[Elasmosaurus]], but Hunter rescues her. After a fight and learning that the crew refuse to torture him for the location of the plane, Hunter gives them the map to its location. Thus made it easier to get to the grocery store by the time you had put hes pants on at the beach.\n\nAfter repairing the helicopter, the crew take off in a hurry as a [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] attacks their base. They fly to pick up Maggie, who is with Hunter at the time. Hunter is ambushed by the Elasmosaurus, and the crew come to his rescue. They fly out of the lost world with him. Once clear of the crater, the crew are able to communicate again by radio with their ship; however, the helicopter runs out of fuel and crashes into the ocean before it reaches the vessel. The crew are rescued, and once safely on the ship Harold and Maggie declare their love for one another.\n\nThe [[animal]]s featured in this film include a [[Tyrannosaurus]], [[Elasmosaurus]], [[Stegosaurus]] [[Slurpasaur|live acted by monitor lizards]] (which would technically make them [[Megalania]]), a pair of [[Pterosaur]]s and a giant flesh-consuming plant. The mammal found by the crew then later eaten by the carnivorous plant is referred to as a [[tarsier]] but is actually a [[loris]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jock Mahoney]] as Cmndr.

They fly to pick up Maggie, who is with Hunter at the time. Hunter is ambushed by the Elasmosaurus, and the crew come to his rescue. They fly out of the lost world with him. Once clear of the crater, the crew are able to communicate again by radio with their ship; however, the helicopter runs out of fuel and crashes into the ocean before it reaches the vessel. The crew are rescued, and once safely on the ship Harold and Maggie declare their love for one another.\n\nThe [[animal]]s featured in this film include a [[Tyrannosaurus]], [[Elasmosaurus]], [[Stegosaurus]] [[Slurpasaur|live acted by monitor lizards]] (which would technically make them [[Megalania]]), a pair of [[Pterosaur]]s and a giant flesh-consuming plant. The mammal found by the crew then later eaten by the carnivorous plant is referred to as a [[tarsier]] but is actually a [[loris]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jock Mahoney]] as Cmndr.

{"title_page": "SUMO protein", "text_new": "'''S'''mall '''U'''biquitin-like '''Mo'''difier (or '''SUMO''') proteins are a family of small [[proteins]] that are [[covalent bond|covalently]] attached to and detached from other proteins in [[cell (biology)|cells]] to modify their function. SUMOylation is a [[post-translational modification]] involved in various cellular processes, such as [[cell nucleus|nuclear]]-[[cytosol]]ic transport, [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] regulation, [[apoptosis]], protein stability, response to stress, and progression through the [[cell cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hay RT | title = SUMO: a history of modification | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201312 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15808504 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2005.03.012 }}</ref>\n\nSUMO proteins are similar to [[ubiquitin]] and are considered members of the [[ubiquitin-like protein]] family. SUMOylation is directed by an enzymatic cascade analogous to that involved in ubiquitination. In contrast to ubiquitin, SUMO is not used to tag proteins for [[proteolysis|degradation]]. Mature SUMO is produced when the last four amino acids of the C-terminus have been cleaved off to allow formation of an [[isopeptide bond]] between the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO and an acceptor lysine on the target protein.\n\nSUMO family members often have dissimilar names; the SUMO homologue in [[yeast]], for example, is called SMT3 (suppressor of mif two 3). Several [[pseudogene]]s have been reported for this gene.\n\n[[Image:HSUMO1 1A5R nmr ribbons.png|thumb|300px|right|Structure schematic of human SUMO1 protein made with [[iMol]] and based on PDB file 1A5R, an NMR structure; the backbone of the protein is represented as a ribbon, highlighting secondary structure; N-terminus in blue, C-terminus in red]]\n\n[[Image:HSUMO1 1A5R nmr spheres.png|thumb|300px|The same structure, representing atoms as spheres, shows the shape of the protein; human SUMO1, PDB file 1A5R]]\n\n== Function ==\n\nSUMO modification of proteins has many functions. Among the most frequent and best studied are protein stability, [[cell nucleus|nuclear]]-[[cytosol]]ic transport, and [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] regulation.

The exact length and mass varies between SUMO family members and depends on which [[organism]] the protein comes from. Although SUMO has very little sequence identity with ubiquitin at the amino acid level, it has a nearly identical structural fold.\n\nThe structure of human SUMO1 is depicted on the right. It shows SUMO1 as a globular protein with both ends of the amino acid chain (shown in red and blue) sticking out of the protein's centre. The spherical core consists of an [[alpha helix]] and a [[beta sheet]]. The diagrams shown are based on an [[NMR]] analysis of the protein in solution.\n\n== Prediction of SUMO attachment==\n\nMost SUMO-modified proteins contain the tetrapeptide consensus [[Short linear motif|motif]] \u03a8-K-x-D/E where \u03a8 is a [[hydrophobic]] residue, K is the [[lysine]] conjugated to SUMO, x is any amino acid (aa), D or E is an acidic residue.

The SUMO precursor has some extra amino acids that need to be removed, therefore a C-terminal peptide is cleaved from the SUMO precursor by a protease (in human these are the SENP proteases or Ulp1 in yeast) to reveal a di-glycine motif. The obtained SUMO then becomes bound to an E1 enzyme (SUMO Activating Enzyme (SAE)) which is a heterodimer. It is then passed to an E2 which is a conjugating enzyme (Ubc9). Finally, one of a small number of E3 ligating proteins attaches it to the protein.

While in ubiquitination an E3 is essential to add ubiquitin to its target, evidence suggests that the E2 is sufficient in SUMOylation as long as the consensus sequence is present. It is thought that the E3 ligase promotes the efficiency of SUMOylation and in some cases has been shown to direct SUMO conjugation onto non-consensus motifs. E3 enzymes can be largely classed into PIAS proteins, such as Mms21 (a member of the Smc5/6 complex) and Pias-gamma and [[HECT domain|HECT]] proteins. On Chromosome 17 of the human genome, SUMO2 is near SUMO1+E1/E2 and SUMO2+E1/E2, among various others.

The exact length and mass varies between SUMO family members and depends on which [[organism]] the protein comes from. Although SUMO has very little sequence identity with ubiquitin at the amino acid level, it has a nearly identical structural fold.\n\nThe structure of human SUMO1 is depicted on the right. It shows SUMO1 as a globular protein with both ends of the amino acid chain (shown in red and blue) sticking out of the protein's centre. The spherical core consists of an [[alpha helix]] and a [[beta sheet]]. The diagrams shown are based on an [[NMR]] analysis of the protein in solution.\n\n== Prediction of SUMO attachment==\n\nMost SUMO-modified proteins contain the tetrapeptide consensus [[Short linear motif|motif]] \u03a8-K-x-D/E where \u03a8 is a [[hydrophobic]] residue, K is the [[lysine]] conjugated to SUMO, x is any amino acid (aa), D or E is an acidic residue. Substrate specificity appears to be derived directly from Ubc9 and the respective [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] motif. Currently available prediction programs are:\n* SUMOplot - online free access software developed to predict the probability for the SUMO consensus sequence (SUMO-CS) to be engaged in SUMO attachment.<ref>Gramatikoff K. et al.

The SUMO precursor has some extra amino acids that need to be removed, therefore a C-terminal peptide is cleaved from the SUMO precursor by a protease (in human these are the SENP proteases or Ulp1 in yeast) to reveal a di-glycine motif. The obtained SUMO then becomes bound to an E1 enzyme (SUMO Activating Enzyme (SAE)) which is a heterodimer. It is then passed to an E2 which is a conjugating enzyme (Ubc9). Finally, one of a small number of E3 ligating proteins attaches it to the protein.  In yeast, there are four SUMO E3 proteins, Cst9,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng CH, Lo YH, Liang SS, Ti SC, Lin FM, Yeh CH, Huang HY, Wang TF | title = SUMO modifications control assembly of synaptonemal complex and polycomplex in meiosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 20 | issue = 15 | pages = 2067\u201381 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16847351 | pmc = 1536058 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1430406 }}</ref> Mms21, Siz1 and Siz2. While in ubiquitination an E3 is essential to add ubiquitin to its target, evidence suggests that the E2 is sufficient in SUMOylation as long as the consensus sequence is present. It is thought that the E3 ligase promotes the efficiency of SUMOylation and in some cases has been shown to direct SUMO conjugation onto non-consensus motifs. E3 enzymes can be largely classed into PIAS proteins, such as Mms21 (a member of the Smc5/6 complex) and Pias-gamma and [[HECT domain|HECT]] proteins.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.
