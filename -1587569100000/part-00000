If anyone must use it, they would be held accompanied.\n\nAt first, the designers of word processing systems combined existing technologies with emerging ones to develop stand-alone equipment, creating a new business distinct from the emerging world of the personal computer.  The concept of word processing arose from the more general ''data'' processing, which since the 1950s had been the application of computers to business administration.<ref>W.A.

The term \u201cword processing\u201d itself was created in the 1950s by [[Ulrich Steinhilper]], a German IBM typewriter sales executive.  However, it did not make its appearance in 1960s office management or computing literatures, though many of the ideas, products, and technologies to which it would later be applied were already well known. But by 1971 the term was recognized by the ''New York Times''<ref> W.D. Smith, \u201cLag Persists for Business Equipment,\u201d New York Times, 26 Oct. 1971, pp. 59-60.</ref> as a business \"buzz word\".  Word processing paralleled the more general \"data processing\", or the application of computers to business administration.\n\nThus by 1972 discussion of word processing was common in publications devoted to business office management and technology, and by the mid-1970s the term would have been familiar to any office manager who consulted business periodicals.\n\n== Electromechanical and electronic word processing ==\nBy the late 1960s, IBM had developed the [[IBM MT/ST]] (Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typewriter).  This was a model of the IBM Selectric typewriter from the earlier part of this decade, but built into its own desk, and integrated with magnetic tape recording and playback facilities, with controls and a bank of electrical relays. The MT/ST automated word wrap, but it had no screen.  This device allowed rewriting text that had been written on another tape and you could collaborate (send the tape to another person for them to edit or make a copy).  It was a revolution for the word processing industry.  In 1969 the tapes were replaced by magnetic cards. These memory cards were introduced in the side of an extra device that accompanied the MT/ST, able to read and record the work.\n\nIn the early 1970s, word processing then became computer-based (although only with single-purpose hardware) with the development of several innovations.  Just before the arrival of the [[personal computer]] (PC), IBM developed the [[floppy disk]].  Also in the early 1970s word-processing systems with a [[CRT screen]] display editing were designed. \n\nAt this time these stand-alone word processing systems were designed, built, and marketed by several pioneering companies. Linolex Systems was founded in 1970 by James Lincoln and Robert Oleksiak. Linolex based its technology on microprocessors, floppy drives and software.  It was a computer-based system for application in the word processing businesses and it sold systems through its own sales force. With a base of installed systems in over 500 sites, Linolex Systems sold 3 million units in 1975 \u2014 a year before the [[Apple computer]], was released.<ref> Linolex Systems, Internal Communications & Disclosure in 3M acquisition, The Petritz Collection, 1975.</ref>. \n\nAt that time, the Lexitron Corporation also produced a series of dedicated word-processing microcomputers. Lexitron was the first to use a full-sized video display screen (CRT) in its models by 1978. Lexitron also used 5{{fraction|1|4}} inch floppy diskettes, which became the standard in the personal computer field. The program disk was inserted in one drive, and the system [[booted up]]. The data diskette was then put in the second drive. The operating system and the word processing program were combined in one file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ricomputermuseum.org/Home/equipment/lexitron-vt1200|title=Lexitron VT1200 - RICM|website=Ricomputermuseum.org|accessdate=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103030112/http://www.ricomputermuseum.org/Home/equipment/lexitron-vt1200|archive-date=3 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>.\n\nAnother of the early word processing adopters was Vydec, which created in 1973 the first modern text processor, the \u201cVydec Word Processing System\u201d.

The Wang displayed text on a CRT screen, and incorporated virtually every fundamental characteristic of word processors as we know them today, a true office machine, affordable by organizations such as medium-sized law firms, and easily learned and operated by secretarial staff.  \n\nThe phrase \"word processor\" rapidly came to refer to CRT-based machines similar to Wang's. Numerous machines of this kind emerged, typically marketed by traditional office-equipment companies such as IBM, Lanier (AES Data machines - re-badged), CPT, and NBI. All were specialized, dedicated, proprietary systems, with prices in the $10,000 range. Cheap general-purpose personal computers were still the domain of hobbyists.\n\n== Word processing software ==\n{{main|Word processor program}}\nThe final step in word processing came with the advent of the personal computer in the late 1970s and 1980s and with the subsequent creation of word processing software. Word processing systems that would create much more complex and capable text were developed and prices began to fall, making them more accessible to the public.{{explain|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first word processing program for personal computers ([[microcomputer]]s) was [[Electric Pencil]], from [[Michael Shrayer Software]], which went on sale in December of 1976. In 1978 [[WordStar]] appeared and because of its many new features soon dominated the market. However, WordStar was written for the early [[CP/M]] (Control Program\u2013Micro) operating system, and by the time it was rewritten for the newer [[MS-DOS]] (Microsoft Disk Operating System), it was obsolete. [[WordPerfect]] and its competitor [[Microsoft Word]] replaced it as the main word processing programs during the MS-DOS era, although there were less successful programs such as [[XyWrite]]. \n\nMost early word processing software required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys such as \"copy\" or \"bold\". Moreover, CP/M lacked cursor keys; for example WordStar used the E-S-D-X-centered \"diamond\" for cursor navigation. However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, and the value added to the latter by software such as \u201c[[killer app]]\u201d spreadsheet applications, e.g. [[VisiCalc]] and [[Lotus 1-2-3]], were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software became serious competition for the dedicated machines and soon dominated the market.\n\nThen in the late 1980s innovations such as the advent of [[Laser printing|laser printers]], a \"typographic\" approach to word processing ([[WYSIWYG]] - What You See Is What You Get), using bitmap displays with multiple fonts (pioneered by the [[Xerox Alto]] computer and [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] word processing program), and graphical user interfaces such as \u201ccopy and paste\u201d (another [[Xerox PARC]] innovation, with the [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy]] word processor). These were popularized by [[MacWrite]] on the Apple Macintosh in 1983, and [[Microsoft Word]] on the IBM PC in 1984. These were probably the first true WYSIWYG word processors to become known to many people. \nOf particular interest also is the standardization of [[TrueType]] fonts used in both Macintosh and Windows PCs. While the publishers of the operating systems provide TrueType typefaces, they are largely gathered from traditional typefaces converted by smaller font publishing houses to replicate standard fonts. A demand for new and interesting fonts, which can be found free of copyright restrictions, or commissioned from font designers, occurred.\n\nThe growing popularity of the Windows operating system in the 1990s later took [[Microsoft Word]] along with it. Originally called \"Microsoft Multi-Tool Word\", this program quickly became a synonym for \u201cword processor\u201d.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of word processors]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{commons|Word processors}}\n\n{{word processors}}\n[[Category:Broad-concept articles]]\n[[Category:Word processors|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Computer program used for writing and editing documents}}\n[[File:TOSHIBA JW-10.JPG|thumb|Toshiba JW-10 stand-alone word processor, released 1978]]\n[[File:Wordstar Screenshot.png|thumb|[[WordStar]], released 1978]]\n[[File:WordPerfectX3.png|thumb|[[WordPerfect]], first released for minicomputers in 1979 and later ported to microcomputers]]\n[[File:LibreOffice 6.2 screenshot.png|thumb|[[LibreOffice Writer]], one of the most popular [[free and open-source]] word processors]]\n\nA '''word processor''' ('''WP''')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J_iAWQ5n914C|title=Computerworld|first=I.

Originally called \"Microsoft Multi-Tool Word\", this program quickly became a synonym for \u201cword processor\u201d.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of word processors]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{commons|Word processors}}\n\n{{word processors}}\n[[Category:Broad-concept articles]]\n[[Category:Word processors|*]]\n", "name_user": "98.254.166.166", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBackground)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor"}

and author.<ref name=\"ISFDB\">{{isfdb name|id=405|name=Don D'Ammassa}}</ref><ref name=\"Clute\">[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/dammassa_don Clute, John. \"Don D'Ammassaa.\"] Article in ''SFE: The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''.</ref> He is chiefly known for his numerous reviews, written over a period of more than thirty years.<ref name=\"Clute\"/> He writes as Don D'Ammassa.<ref name=\"ISFDB\"/><ref name=\"Clute\"/>\n\n==Writing career==\nD'Ammassa first made a name for himself as a fan writer in the 1970s; he was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer]] for 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1986, and his [[fanzine]] ''Mythologies'' was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]] for 1977 and 1985. His career as both critic and professional author began in the early 1980s. A long-time reviewer for ''[[Science Fiction Chronicle]]'', his reviews have also appeared in other venues, and many are compiled on his website ''Critical Mass''. According to [[John Clute]], his assessments are \"noted for ... fairness and generosity, and for the extremely wide range of texts he has covered.\" His broad knowledge of speculative and adventure fiction are reflected in his ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (2005), ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction'' (2006) and ''Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction'' (2009).<ref name=\"Clute\"/>\n\nAs a short story writer D'Ammassa has produced a substantial body of horror stories and relatively fewer science fiction and fantasy tales. His longer works are more evenly divided between these genres. His more recent novels \"convey a sense that he is systematically traversing the worlds of twentieth century sf in order to pay tribute from a more recent perspective to the worlds and modes typical of the form.\"<ref name=\"Clute\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Series===\n====Sandor Dyle====\n*''Scarab'' (2004)\n*''Narcissus'' (2007)\n\n====Wanda Coyne====\n*''The Maltese Gargoyle'' (2015)\n*''The Hippogriff of the Baskervilles'' (2016)\n*''Ten Little Homunculi'' (2017)\n\n===Other novels===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Blood Beast'' (1988; rewritten as ''The Gargoyle'' (2011))\n*''Servants of Chaos (2002)\n*''Haven'' (2004)\n*''Dead of Winter'' (2007)\n*''The Kaleidoscope'' (2015)\n*''The Sinking Island'' (2015)\n*''Caverns of Chaos'' (2015)\n*''Living Things'' (2015)\n*''Perilous Pursuits'' (2015)\n*''Wormdance'' (2015)\n*''Carbon Copies'' (2015) \n*''Multiplicity'' (2015)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Collections===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Translation Station'' (2011)\n*''That Way Madness Lies'' (2015)\n*''Little Evils'' (2015)\n*''Passing Death'' (2015)\n*''Elaborate Lies: Tales of Fantasy'' (2015)\n*''Date with the Dark'' (2015)\n*''Sandcastles'' (2015)\n*''The Devil Is in the Details'' (2015)\n*''Alien & Otherwise'' (2015)\n*''Shadows Over R'lyeh'' (2015)\n*''Phantom of the Space Opera'' (2015)\n*''More Shadows Over R'lyeh'' (2017) \n{{div col end}}\n\n===Short stories===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*\"Automatic Success\" (1982)\n*\"Love Charm\" (1985)\n*\"The Hatchetman\" (1989)\n*\"Literally Speaking\" (1990)\n*\"Little Evils\" (1991)\n*\"Strange Developments\" (1991)\n*\"The Guard Tower\" (1991)\n*\"The Splicer\" (1991)\n*\"Wake Up Call\" (1991)\n*\"Shadow Over R'lyeh\" (1991)\n*\"Context\" (1992)\n*\"The Dead Beat Society\" (1992)\n*\"Homework\" (1992)\n*\"Cleansing Agent\" (1993)\n*\"Friday Nights at Home\" (1993)\n*\"Puppets\" (1993)\n*\"Subterrine -
