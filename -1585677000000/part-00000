Among the approximately 12 people he converted was Thomas G. Aslan, who later made contact with [[John Nevins Andrews]] and helped him prepare a Romanian-language paper. Visits in the mid-1880s from [[George I. Butler]], president of the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]], and [[Bourdeau brothers|Augustin C. Bourdeau]], an evangelist, followed these initial contacts.<ref name=\"land252\"/><ref name=\"Pope186\">Pope, p. 186</ref> In 1890 [[Ludwig R. Conradi]] entered [[Transylvania]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], in search of converts. As a result of Conradi's efforts, by the mid-1890s several individuals in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] had converted to Adventism. Meanwhile, in 1892 Conradi organized several [[ethnic German]] Adventists who had recently moved from the [[Russian Empire]] to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] into a church. Eventually these Adventists settled in Viile Noi, a neighbourhood of [[Constan\u0163a]].<ref name=\"land252\"/>\n\nJohann F. Ginter, an evangelist from Russia, moved to [[Bucharest]] in 1904 and soon converted several individuals, among them Peter Paulini (a medical student) and \u015etefan Demetrescu (a [[Romanian Army]] officer), who then attended the [[Friedensau Adventist University|Adventist training school]] in [[M\u00f6ckern]], [[German Empire|Germany]]. By the time Paulini and Demetrescu returned to Romania, the government had expelled Ginter, but the newly trained Romanian Adventists were ready to take his place. Conferences organized beginning in 1907 and the Romanian Union Conference formed in 1919 with about 2,000 members. Starting in 1908 Romanian Adventists had their publications printed by the [[Hamburg]] press in Germany, but in 1920 they established the Adventist Publishing House in Bucharest. Three years later the Romanian Union Training School opened in Bucharest but moved to [[T\u00e2rn\u0103veni|Dicios\u00e2nmartin]] in 1926 and then [[Bra\u015fov]] in 1931.<ref name=\"land252\">Land, p.252</ref> The Conference registered as a religious association in 1928,<ref name=\"Pope186\"/> but during the period of [[Greater Romania]], it functioned in semi-legality, sometimes permitted to function and at other times banned.<ref name=\"culte\"/> In 1930 there were 7,700 (or 16,100<ref name=\"culte\">{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.culte.gov.ro/biserica-adventista-de-ziua-a-saptea \"Biserica Adventist\u0103 de Ziua a \u015eaptea\" (\"The Seventh-day Adventist Church\")], at the [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], [http://www.culte.ro/ Under-Secretariat for Culture and Religious Affairs]; accessed December 28, 2011</ref>) members, 65 ministers and 290 houses of prayer.<ref name=\"Pope186\"/>\n\nAt the start of [[World War II]], there were some 13,000 (or 25,000<ref name=\"Pope186\"/>) Adventists in Romania. In 1941, as [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] troops entered Romania, the [[Wehrmacht]] confiscated the training school building and completely closed the institution the next year (''see also [[Romania during World War II]]'').<ref name=\"land252\"/> At the end of that year the [[Ion Antonescu|Antonescu]] regime closed all Adventist churches and imprisoned church leaders, but meetings continued in secret. The school (as well as the churches) opened again in 1944 and beginning in 1950 operated under the name Romanian Theological Seminary. Meanwhile, the publishing house closed in 1942, opening again in 1944 until taken over by the government three years later.

The church leadership was reluctant to complain about state interference if it meant losing any of its \"privileges\", which included travel to conferences abroad by 1980.

Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the [[Australian Regular Army]] and 35 days for members of the [[Australian Army Reserve]]. In basic training recruits are taught drill, weapons and workplace safety, basic equipment maintenance, marksmanship, fieldcraft, radio use and defensive/offensive operations.\n\n===Regional Force Surveillance Units===\nTraining for recruits in the [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]]s usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army. For instance, [[NORFORCE]] recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats. Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population, and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case.\n\n===Royal Military College Duntroon===\nRecruit Training for officers in the Australian Army (known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training) takes place at [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC). The ICT is conducted for approximately seven weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training, military history, leadership, strategic studies and other such skills at section, platoon and company levels. Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and, if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants (pronounced Left-tenant). The overall full-time officer training course at RMC is 18 months long.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:RMC Sandhurst 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets compete in the prestigious Sandhurst Competition.]]\nCentralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940, and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada, recruit training had been done by individual units or depots.\n\nThe [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|unified into one service]], the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968. The Canadian Forces Training System, a unified system for all the services, was devised and remains in place today.\n\nMost non-commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force (full-time) participate in the 10-week [[Basic Military Qualification]] (BMQ) at [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]. Regular Force officers complete their 15-week [[Basic Military Officer Qualification]] (BMOQ) at CFLRS as well, before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training.\n\nAfter basic training, personnel are trained in the specialty of their \"environment\". Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five-week sea environment training course; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course, while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase (now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification-Land); while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training.\n\nReservists, particularly the Army Reserve, may conduct basic and trades training part-time, generally alternating weekends with their own units. Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force, many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force. Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ/SQ combined course (Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification) during the summer. Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division [[Borden, Ontario]] equivalent to Regular Force BMQ, at [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]]. Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Qu\u00e9bec (a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training). Navy trains its personnel in [[seamanship]], [[firefighting]], damage control and other skills after BMQ, in the Naval Environmental Training Program (NETP) in either [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is a degree-granting university. The [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] is a Canadian military academy located on the site of [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)]],\n\n== China ==\n{{Main|Military education and training in China}}\n\n==Denmark==\nThe [[Danish Army]] conducts the HBU (H\u00e6rens Basisuddannelse, Army Basic Training course) at 8 bases around the country. The course lasts four months, and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence, and on recruiting for the army's international missions, and for the NCO-schools. The recruits are technically conscripts, but during recession years, many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU.\n\n==Finland==\nTraining lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total. All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training (''peruskoulutuskausi''), which is essentially the same for all servicemen. It includes assault rifle ([[Rk 62|RK-62]]/[[Rk 95 Tp|RK-95]]) marksman training, few other basic weapon training, battle training, short field medic training and camping skills. At the end of this training, all men are promoted to their first military rank. After this, specialized training is given depending on the person (5,5\u201311,5 months). The NCO trainees go to AUK (NCO school) and become corporals or sergeants, from which some are selected to [[Reserve Officer School|RUK (Reserve officer school)]] and become second lieutenants. The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months.\n\n==France==\nIn the French army, the \"Formation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Initiale\" (FGI) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang (CFIM). There are 10 CFIM in the country. Prior to this course, new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get issued gear, complete administrative documents and a final medical exam before starting training => in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve.\n\nAfter completing the 12 week FGI course, recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate (say BCT graduation) and are considered as private 2nd class. After one week of leave, they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 Initiale (FSI) => MOS training.\n\nAfter FGI+FSI, they can start training with their platoon for external deployment.

Rather than \"breaking\" the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression, German basic training generally tries to \"mold\" a recruit's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Greece==\nWhile until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based, since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted, which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted. While initially training of the two institutions was shared, it has since then diverged, and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased.\n\nProfessional Enlisted, signing 7-year contracts, are called once per year. They go through a 14-week initial training, which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony, and an 8-week combat course.

At the end of those two-days, if fit for service, recruits are assigned to a position in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].\n\nA few months later, recruits start an 18-week (23-week for special forces) boot camp ({{lang-de|Rekrutenschulen}}; {{lang-fr|\u00e9cole de recure}}; {{lang-it|scuola reclute}}) during which they are allowed to go home on week-ends. There are two boot camp start per year : January (Winter) and June (Summer). During the recruitment process, recruits can choose whether they would like to serve during summer or winter.\n\nIn the first seven weeks of boot camp, recruits receive \"General Basic Instruction\" ({{lang-de|Allgemeine Grundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction de base g\u00e9n\u00e9rale}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base generale}}). During this period, recruits are instructed by their [[sergeants]] to [[military tactics]], the use of [[weaponry]] (including [[Stgw 90|SIG SG 550]]) and other equipment, [[marksmanship]], self-defense skills, buddy- and self- aid, [[CBRN defense]], basic survival skills, etc. Recruits are also educated to military life, including how to speak to their superiors, how to clean their weapons and combat shoes, how to clean the barracks, etc. During this period, recruits practice sport on a daily basis, including [[foot drill]], running, team sports, push-ups, etc. And a few kilometers march (up to 50&nbsp;km) some weeks.\n\nThe second phase of six weeks is devoted to ''function-specific basic instructions'' ({{lang-de|Funktionsgrundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr| Instruction de base sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la fonction}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base alla funzione}}), where recruits learn skills specific to their job.\n\nIn the third phase, called \"instruction in formation\" ({{lang-de|Verbandsausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction en formation}}; {{lang-it| Istruzione di reparto}}), [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]] and [[battalion]]s are formed.<ref>{{cite web |title=D\u00e9roulement de l'\u00e9cole |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508153626/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |archive-date=8 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{See also|Selection and Training in the British Army}}British armed forces recruits train in two phases. Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months, bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability. Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role. Infantry training is an exception, combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months.\n\nThe [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]] manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments.\n\nThe first six weeks of training are the most demanding. Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time.\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, recruit training in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is called [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]] (BCT); U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS (11 Series, 19 series, 13 series, 12 series) undergo One Station Unit Training (OSUT) which involves BCT, Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training (such as Bradley, or Mortar School, or Gunnery) all in one. In the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] it is called [[Basic Military Training]] (BMT). In the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] it is called \"Recruit Training\" (commonly known as Boot Camp).\n\nSome services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training. The Army typically issues the [[Army Service Ribbon]] (issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training), and the Air Force presents the [[Air Force Training Ribbon]] and the [[Airman's coin|Airman's Coin]]. The Marine Corps issue the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines. The Navy replaces the \"RECRUIT\" ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the \"NAVY\" ball cap upon successful completion of \"Battle Stations\". The United States Coast Guard's recruit training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap.\n\nFor honor graduates of basic training, the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy present a [[Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon]]. The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay-grade (up to a maximum of E-3).\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Army===\n[[File:Drill-push.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army recruits being instructed]]\n{{Main|United States Army Basic Training}}\n\nIn the [[United States Army]], recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military [[Military Occupational Specialty]], or MOS, which is selected upon enlistment.\n\nInitial Entry Training (IET) is divided into two parts, which commonly take place at two different locations, depending on the chosen MOS:\n*Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is a ten-week training cycle. This period does not include \"Reception Week\" during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies (troops for cavalry).\n*Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS. The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year.\n*Several MOSs (mainly combat arms) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which can last up to 22 weeks. The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle, including drill instructors.  Essentially, OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training, especially for Infantry OSUT, which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle, although in greater detail. Infantry OSUT is conducted at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, and lasts up to 22 weeks as of 2019.\nThe U.S. Army has four sites for BCT:\n*[[Fort Benning]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]\n*[[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n*[[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in [[St. Robert, Missouri]]\n*[[Fort Sill]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]\n\nDuring Basic Combat Training, Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including: Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM), land navigation, patrolling, securing and defending a position, drill and ceremony, fireteam formations and assaults, communications and use of AN/PRC-119 radio, combat lifesaving skills, 9-line medevac, reporting intelligence, hand grenades, Claymore mines, M203/M320 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), M240B machine gun, M2 .50 caliber machine gun, MK-19, and AT-4 anti-tank weapon. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, the Confidence Course, conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles, physical training, and Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP), a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, and a number of others.<ref>[[Combatives#Modern Army Combatives]]</ref> Recruits are trained to adopt the Army \"Warrior Ethos\", and to memorize and live by the [[Soldier's Creed]].\n\nBCT is divided into three phases. During Phase I, (also known as \"Red Phase\") recruits are subject to \"Total Control,\" meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants. The first week of training is commonly referred to as \"Hell Week,\" due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits. Marches are common throughout basic training. Recruits are sent to the \"gas chamber\" during Phase I, as part of training for defensive chemical warfare. They are also introduced to their standard-issue weapon, the [[M16A2 rifle]], the [[M16A4]] rifle, or [[M4 carbine]].\n\nIn Phase II (also known as \"White Phase\") soldiers begin actually firing weapons, starting with the rifle or carbine ([[M4A1]]). Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades (such as the M67 fragmentation grenade) and grenade launchers (such as the M203). Recruits are then familiarized with the [[bayonet]], anti-tank/armor weaponry and other heavy weapons. The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time. Additionally, Phase II includes continual, intense PT, along with drill and ceremony training. At the conclusion of Phase II, Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained.\n\nPhase III or \"Blue Phase,\" is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases. A final PT test is administered during the first week. Recruits who fail are frequently retested, often up until the morning of their cycle's graduation. If they do not pass, then they are recycled to another platoon that is in an earlier phase of the training cycle until they meet the fitness standards. The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). Usually, a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category (pushups, sit-ups, and 2 mile run) to pass, but in Basic Combat Training, only 50 points are required; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT. During Blue Phase, the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive \"bivouac\" and FTX ([[Field Training Exercise]]s) as nighttime combat operations. Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans, etc.\n\nUpon completion of Basic Combat Training, a recruit is now a soldier, and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment, as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS-specific duties under fire.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\n{{Main|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}\n[[File:Marine-drill-instructor.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructor works with enlistees, or individuals who have not left yet for recruit training.

Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol, physical training, [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program|MCMAP]] training, academic classes, initial drill, a series inspection, and the confidence course. West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase. Phase two is completely in the field at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] for west coast recruits, with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle, and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations, land navigation, and hikes. For east coast recruits, phase two is swim qualification, rifle qualification, and Team Week, a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail. Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill, final inspection, more PT and confidence courses, and graduation. During third phase, west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event. Parris Island recruits finish with field training, final drill and inspection, the Crucible, and graduation. Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training, if in a different order.

Upon completion, Marines proceed to their MOS-specific school.\n\nIn Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), [[infantry]] [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|MOS]] (03XX) Marines receive 59 days of training in infantry skills, including advanced marksmanship, combat patrolling, land navigation, and a wide array of other infantry skills. Upon completion of ITB, newly qualified Marine infantrymen proceed to their assigned units.\n\n===U.S. Navy===\n[[File:Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|In March 2002, a U.S. Navy Recruit Division Commander conducts \"Instructional Training\" to correct substandard performance during boot camp.]]\n{{Main|Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois}}\nThe [[United States Navy]] currently operates boot camp at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], near [[North Chicago, Illinois]]. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example, 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the [[M9 pistol]] and [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the [[M16 rifle|M16]] in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various \"A\" Schools located across the United States\u2014where they begin training to receive their [[List of United States Navy ratings|ratings]] (jobs)\u2014or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.\n\nThe Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego, California; Orlando, Florida; Meridian, Mississippi; and [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Port Deposit (Bainbridge), Maryland]]. From 1942 to 1946\u2014during and immediately following World War II\u2014the Navy had two additional training sites: Naval Training Station (USNTS) Sampson (renamed [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in 1950), near Seneca Lake, New York, where over 400,000 recruits were trained, and [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho.\n\n===U.S. Air Force===\n[[File:Air Force Military Training Instructor.jpg|thumb|upright|A formation of USAF airmen]]\n{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}\nThe U.S. Air Force's Basic Military Training (BMT) is eight and a half weeks long, as they do not count the first week (\"Week 0\"). BMT is 63 calendar days long. It is conducted at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formerly, trainees were referred to as \"Airman\" from day one of BMT. This has been changed; now, personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman's Coin Ceremony in the eighth week of training, when they receive their Airman's Coin.  Trainees receive military instruction (including the Air Force core values, flight and individual drill, and living area inspections), academic classes (covering topics such as Air Force history, dress and appearance, military customs and courtesies, ethics, security, and alcohol/drug abuse prevention and treatment), and field training (including protection against biological and chemical attack, basic marksmanship on the [[M4 carbine]] as well as self-aid buddy care).  Following BMT, Airmen go to a technical school (or 'tech school') where they learn the specifics of their [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC), which is equivalent to the MOS ([[Military Occupational Specialty]]) in the Army and Marines, the Navy's NEC (Naval Enlisted Classification) code, or the Coast Guard's ratings.\n\nAll non-prior-service enlistees are required to complete BMT, including those enlisting in the [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]]. Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active-duty counterparts. Credit can be given on a case-by-case basis for enlistees with college credit, Eagle Scouts and service in the [[Civil Air Patrol]] qualify for promotion to E-2 ([[Airman]]) or E-3 ([[Airman First Class]]) upon graduation from BMT. The stripes are not worn until graduation, though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade.\n\nLackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force's entire history. From 1950 to 1956, 300,000 airmen received BMT at [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in New York.  In 1951, [[Parks Air Force Base]] in [[Dublin, California]] became a BMT center, with training beginning in March 1952. BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959. For a brief time between 1966 and 1968, the Air Force operated a second BMT at [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo Air Force Base]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].\n\nUnlike the Army and Navy, but like the Marine Corps (throughout boot camp) and Coast Guard (during the first section of boot camp), trainees are required to refer to all Airmen, enlisted and NCO's as well as commissioned and warrant officers, as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\". Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement: \"Sir/Ma'am, Trainee (the recruit's surname) reports as ordered\".\n\nAn additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1, 2008, extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks. BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|title=BMT extended, NCOs to learn new languages|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=1 January 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717031836/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|archivedate=17 July 2012}}</ref> In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks. Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks, however, the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman's Week, which is designed to transition trainees to technical training.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard===\n[[File:USCG Basic Training.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs a recruit during basic training.]]\nRecruit training for the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is held at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|title=USCG Recruit Training|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526231653/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|archive-date=26 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Coast Guard base on Government Island (now known as [[Coast Guard Island]]) [[Alameda, California]] was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982. The official standard recruit training cycle lasts eight weeks. A limited number of recruits may face reversion to earlier weeks of training should they exhibit egregious deficiencies in attitude and/or aptitude.\n  \nAs an alternate for those recruits possessing prior military service or civilian job skills, Coast Guard recruit basic training offers an abbreviated route to completion of basic training with the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training program (DEPOT) \"The goal of the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training Course is to produce petty officers who on the basis of their civilian professions, prior military experience, or a combination of both\" are otherwise duly qualified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|title=DEPOT|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711191210/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCoast Guard boot camp covers basic seamanship, drill, military bearing and firefighting. The U.S. Coast Guard is unique among the armed services in that it fires the [[SIG Sauer P229|SIG Sauer P229R]] pistol as well as the [[M16 rifle]] during the training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|title=Military Life|last=Military.com|accessdate=1 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106114450/http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|archive-date=6 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Coast Guard is a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], rather than the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], it is by law and tradition a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As with all military personnel, Coast Guardsmen are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). Due to the Coast Guard's unique mission set \u2013 including [[CONUS]] and [[CONUS#CONUS/OCONUS|OCONUS]] defense operations, search and rescue and maritime law enforcement \u2013 there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and military bearing. Due to its unusual, diverse and difficult mission, the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards. As an example, the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard Academy]] is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates rather than congressional appointment.\n\nDuring their time at Cape May, recruits are subjected to the usual \"boot camp\" atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation. Recruits must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders. The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits (SR; E-1). Unique to the Coast Guard among the armed services, recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice/Fireman Apprentice (SA/FA; E-2) or Seaman/Fireman (SN/FN; E-3) upon graduation\u2014the difference generally based on level of higher education the graduate possesses. Coast Guard drill instructors are called \"company commanders\" and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8). Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits.\n\nAfter completing boot camp, recruits can select their rating and then attend an \"A\" school. Few graduates go straight to \"A\" school; most spend up to a year in the fleet as \"non-rates\". \"A\" school is a long-term technical school providing specific instruction about a rating. The \"A\" schools last two to six months and usually occur at [[Training Center Yorktown|TRACEN Yorktown]], [[Yorktown, Virginia]] or [[Training Center Petaluma|TRACEN Petaluma]], [[Petaluma, California]]. Aviation related ratings train at the Aviation Technical Training Center at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City]], [[North Carolina]]. Some ratings have an available on-the-job apprenticeship training option known as \"striking\" instead of attending an \"A\" school.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military education and training]]\n*[[Milling (military training exercise)|Milling]] - military training exercise\n*[[Military Academy]]\n*[[Officer Candidate School]]\n*[[Resocialization]]\n*[[Psychological conditioning]]\n*[[Military recruitment]]\n*[[Military service]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* USAREC (2003).

Some nations operate both volunteer and conscription systems simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words-1|title=Louder than words: An agenda for action to end state use of child soldiers|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206214053/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words-1|archive-date=2017-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nRecruit training differs according to [[military branch]]:\n* [[Army]] and [[Marine Corps]] recruits are normally trained in basic [[marksmanship]] with individually assigned [[weapon]]s, field maintenance of weapons, [[physical fitness]] training, [[first aid]], and basic survival techniques.\n* [[Navy]] and [[Coast Guard]] training usually focuses on water survival training, physical fitness, basic seamanship, and such skills as shipboard [[firefighting]], basic [[engineering]], and signals.\n* [[Air force]] training usually includes physical fitness training, military and classroom instructions, and field training in basic marksmanship and first aid.\nThe training further differs according to military role:\n\nRecruits for [[close combat]] roles (e.g. [[infantry]] are trained to fight at [[Close quarters combat|close quarters]], including with a [[bayonet]]; training for these positions is normally more vigorous and aggressive than that for other roles (e.g. [[Military logistics|logistics]]).\n\n== Australia ==\n{{Main|Australian Army Recruit Training}}\nMost of the recruit training in the [[Australian Army]] is currently held at [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] (ARTC) at [[Kapooka]], near [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]]. Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the [[Australian Regular Army]] and 35 days for members of the [[Australian Army Reserve]]. In basic training recruits are taught drill, weapons and workplace safety, basic equipment maintenance, marksmanship, fieldcraft, radio use and defensive/offensive operations.\n\n===Regional Force Surveillance Units===\nTraining for recruits in the [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]]s usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army. For instance, [[NORFORCE]] recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats. Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population, and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case.\n\n===Royal Military College Duntroon===\nRecruit Training for officers in the Australian Army (known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training) takes place at [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC). The ICT is conducted for approximately seven weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training, military history, leadership, strategic studies and other such skills at section, platoon and company levels. Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and, if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants (pronounced Left-tenant). The overall full-time officer training course at RMC is 18 months long.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:RMC Sandhurst 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets compete in the prestigious Sandhurst Competition.]]\nCentralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940, and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada, recruit training had been done by individual units or depots.\n\nThe [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|unified into one service]], the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968. The Canadian Forces Training System, a unified system for all the services, was devised and remains in place today.\n\nMost non-commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force (full-time) participate in the 10-week [[Basic Military Qualification]] (BMQ) at [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]. Regular Force officers complete their 15-week [[Basic Military Officer Qualification]] (BMOQ) at CFLRS as well, before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training.\n\nAfter basic training, personnel are trained in the specialty of their \"environment\". Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five-week sea environment training course; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course, while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase (now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification-Land); while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training.\n\nReservists, particularly the Army Reserve, may conduct basic and trades training part-time, generally alternating weekends with their own units. Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force, many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force. Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ/SQ combined course (Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification) during the summer. Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division [[Borden, Ontario]] equivalent to Regular Force BMQ, at [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]]. Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Qu\u00e9bec (a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training). Navy trains its personnel in [[seamanship]], [[firefighting]], damage control and other skills after BMQ, in the Naval Environmental Training Program (NETP) in either [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is a degree-granting university. The [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] is a Canadian military academy located on the site of [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)]],\n\n== China ==\n{{Main|Military education and training in China}}\n\n==Denmark==\nThe [[Danish Army]] conducts the HBU (H\u00e6rens Basisuddannelse, Army Basic Training course) at 8 bases around the country. The course lasts four months, and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence, and on recruiting for the army's international missions, and for the NCO-schools. The recruits are technically conscripts, but during recession years, many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU.\n\n==Finland==\nTraining lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total. All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training (''peruskoulutuskausi''), which is essentially the same for all servicemen. It includes assault rifle ([[Rk 62|RK-62]]/[[Rk 95 Tp|RK-95]]) marksman training, few other basic weapon training, battle training, short field medic training and camping skills. At the end of this training, all men are promoted to their first military rank. After this, specialized training is given depending on the person (5,5\u201311,5 months). The NCO trainees go to AUK (NCO school) and become corporals or sergeants, from which some are selected to [[Reserve Officer School|RUK (Reserve officer school)]] and become second lieutenants. The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months.\n\n==France==\nIn the French army, the \"Formation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Initiale\" (FGI) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang (CFIM). There are 10 CFIM in the country. Prior to this course, new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get issued gear, complete administrative documents and a final medical exam before starting training => in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve.\n\nAfter completing the 12 week FGI course, recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate (say BCT graduation) and are considered as private 2nd class. After one week of leave, they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 Initiale (FSI) => MOS training.\n\nAfter FGI+FSI, they can start training with their platoon for external deployment. Usually, Private 1st class rank is earned after 6 to 12 month of time in service.\n\nFor some units (mountain troops - airborne), there is also during first year a Formation d'Adaptation (FA)  for basic mountain training (2 \u00d7 2 weeks) or parachute school (3 weeks)\n\nContent of FGI is the following one:\n\nDrills,\nFirst aid and chemical warfare,\nPT and obstacle course,\nFirst weapon qualification (FAMAS, pistol and grenade), \nSignals,\nBasic field and infantry training (even if not MOS11B later on),\nPresentation of French army, soldiers duties and reports.\n\n==Germany==\nThe Allgemeine Grundausbildung (AGA) (i.e. ''general basic training'') of the [[Bundeswehr]] covers the first three months of military service.\n\nThe contents of the \"Allgemeine Grundausbildung\" includes\n\n* Formal training (ranks, flags, orders and other fundamentals)\n* Weapon Drill and Basic Combat training for all soldiers (Rifle, Pistol and machine gun drills are mandatory for every soldier)\n* Theoretical Courses about Democracy and legal regulations\n* Sports: the Basic Fitness Test (BFT) and the German Sports Badge (DSA)\n* Guard duty training (ATB SichSdt)\n* First Aid\n\nA notable peculiarity of German basic training is rooted in German military tradition that prefers initiative to obedience. Rather than \"breaking\" the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression, German basic training generally tries to \"mold\" a recruit's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Greece==\nWhile until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based, since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted, which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted. While initially training of the two institutions was shared, it has since then diverged, and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased.\n\nProfessional Enlisted, signing 7-year contracts, are called once per year. They go through a 14-week initial training, which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony, and an 8-week combat course. After that period they proceed to specialty training which can last from 4 to 42 weeks.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&la=1|title=\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd - \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u039c\u0398-\u0395\u03a0\u039f\u03a0|website=www.army.gr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628072348/http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&la=1|archive-date=2015-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConscripted enlisted, serving a 9-month obligation, are called 6 times per year. They report to various recruit camps spread over the country. The first week is the reception week, followed by a 3-week basic soldier training course, which ends with the oathing ceremony. Depending on their awarded specialty the conscript recruits are then transferred to specialty training camps or to operational units. In the operational units the recruits go through a 3-week 'advanced' recruit training course, followed occasionally (depending on whether they have already received specialty training or not), by a 2 to 6 week specialty training course, conducted by the unit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==India==\n{{Main|Military academies in India}}\nThe Indian military services have established numerous and distinguished academies and staff colleges across India for the purpose of training professional soldiers in new generation military sciences, warfare command and strategy, and associated technologies.\n\n==Israel==\n{{Main|Tironut}}\nThe recruit training of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (called '''''tironut''''' in Hebrew) varies depending on the unit: virtually every unusual unit completes a different training course. Recruits are certified as riflemen after the completion of the training, while most non-combat units train in all-army bases for the certification of Rifleman 02. Individuals who want to become officers must apply to be trained at a facility in the Negev desert called \"Bahad One\" (abbreviation of \"Basis Hadracha\", Instruction Base).\n\n==Pakistan==\n{{Main|Pakistan Military Academy}}\nThe Pakistan Military Academy (or '''PMA''') is a [[Military Academy]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. It is located at [[Kakul]] in [[Abbottabad]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The Pakistan Military Academy is analogous to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[West Point]] or [[Tironut]] and undertakes training of the prospective officers of Pakistan Army. The academy has four training battalions and sixteen companies. A Cadet is trained and passed out as an officer of the Pakistan Army in 2 years.\n\nEnlisted Men undertake training at the Regimental Center of their chosen regiment.\n\n== Russia ==\n{{Main|Military academies in Russia}}\n\n==Singapore==\n{{update|section|date=July 2011}}\n{{Main|National Service in Singapore}}\nNational Service (NS) in Singapore is compulsory for all able-bodied male citizens and second generation permanent residents who have reached the age of 18.

Following basic training specialized training would be carried out at Regimental Training Centres.\n\nBasic training for new recruits of the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] which is approximately six months are conducted at  ''Advanced Naval Training Center'', SLNS 'Nipuna'; ''Naval Artificer Training Institute'', SLNS 'Thakshila', Welisara; and at Naval Recruit Training Centres at several shore establishments . This basic training will be followed by ''on-the-job'' training on-board fleet units and at shore establishments. Combat Training School at SLNS 'Pandukabaya' conducts combat training for [[Sri Lanka Navy#Naval Patrolmen|Naval Patrolmen]].\n\nBasic training for airmen of the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] is handled by the Training Wing of the [[SLAF Diyatalawa]]. This is followed by secularized training at '' Advanced & Specialized Trade Training School''.\n\n== Sweden ==\nSince conscription ended in [[Sweden]] in 2010 (reintroduced in 2017), all recruits who seek employment within the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] have to go through ''Grundl\u00e4ggande Milit\u00e4r Utbildning'' (GMU) (Basic Military Training) for three months.\n\nSince conscription was reintroduced in 2017, all recruits who seek employment in the Swedish Armed Forces have to go through ''Grundutbildning'' (GU) (Basic Training), which consists of two parts; ''Grundl\u00e4ggande Milit\u00e4r Utbildning''  (GMU) (Basic Military Training) that lasts for 3 months and aims to provide every recruit with the same foundation for continued military service, and ''Befattningsutbildning'' (Specialization Education) for between 1\u201311 months depending on specialization.\n\nThere is also a shorter volunteer training program for people who seek service within the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard]] called GU-F. GU-F training takes only 14 days, but following a completed GU-F, a guardsman may go through additional training in order to specialize within the Home Guard.\n\nBasic training as part of GU as well as GU-F usually takes place at any of the [[Swedish Army]] training units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|title=Grundutbildning|last=F\u00f6rsvarsmakten|website=F\u00f6rsvarsmakten|language=sv-SE|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011154520/http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|archive-date=2016-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Switzerland ==\n[[Switzerland]] has mandatory military service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4rdienst}}; {{lang-fr|service militaire}}; {{lang-it|servizio militare}}) in the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Army]] for all able-bodied male [[Swiss citizen|citizens]], who are [[conscription|conscripted]] when they reach the [[age of majority]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Conscrits et recrues |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut.html |language=French |publisher=[[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports]] |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502061315/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut.html |archive-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though women may volunteer for any position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Femmes dans l'arm\u00e9e |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/fda.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502010612/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/fda.html |archive-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Conscripts make up the majority of the manpower in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"basics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation.parsys.68630.downloadList.58401.DownloadFile.tmp/02armeegrundgliederung20090401en.pdf|title=The basic organisation of the Swiss Armed Forces|publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200504/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation.parsys.68630.downloadList.58401.DownloadFile.tmp/02armeegrundgliederung20090401en.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=12 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 19, all male Swiss nationals must attend the two-day recruitment process in one of the six recruitment centres spread across Switzerland ([[Aarau]], [[Payerne]], [[Sumiswald]], [[Monte Ceneri]], [[R\u00fcti, Z\u00fcrich|R\u00fcti]], [[Mels]]).

During this period, recruits are instructed by their [[sergeants]] to [[military tactics]], the use of [[weaponry]] (including [[Stgw 90|SIG SG 550]]) and other equipment, [[marksmanship]], self-defense skills, buddy- and self- aid, [[CBRN defense]], basic survival skills, etc. Recruits are also educated to military life, including how to speak to their superiors, how to clean their weapons and combat shoes, how to clean the barracks, etc. During this period, recruits practice sport on a daily basis, including [[foot drill]], running, team sports, push-ups, etc. And a few kilometers march (up to 50&nbsp;km) some weeks.\n\nThe second phase of six weeks is devoted to ''function-specific basic instructions'' ({{lang-de|Funktionsgrundausbildung}}; {{lang-fr| Instruction de base sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la fonction}}; {{lang-it|Istruzione di base alla funzione}}), where recruits learn skills specific to their job.\n\nIn the third phase, called \"instruction in formation\" ({{lang-de|Verbandsausbildung}}; {{lang-fr|Instruction en formation}}; {{lang-it| Istruzione di reparto}}), [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]] and [[battalion]]s are formed.<ref>{{cite web |title=D\u00e9roulement de l'\u00e9cole |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |language=French |publisher=Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports |accessdate=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508153626/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/fr/home/militaerdienst/rekrut/rs/schulablauf.html |archive-date=8 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{See also|Selection and Training in the British Army}}British armed forces recruits train in two phases. Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months, bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability. Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role. Infantry training is an exception, combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months.\n\nThe [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]] manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments.\n\nThe first six weeks of training are the most demanding. Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time.\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, recruit training in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is called [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]] (BCT); U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS (11 Series, 19 series, 13 series, 12 series) undergo One Station Unit Training (OSUT) which involves BCT, Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training (such as Bradley, or Mortar School, or Gunnery) all in one. In the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] it is called [[Basic Military Training]] (BMT). In the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] it is called \"Recruit Training\" (commonly known as Boot Camp).\n\nSome services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training. The Army typically issues the [[Army Service Ribbon]] (issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training), and the Air Force presents the [[Air Force Training Ribbon]] and the [[Airman's coin|Airman's Coin]]. The Marine Corps issue the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines. The Navy replaces the \"RECRUIT\" ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the \"NAVY\" ball cap upon successful completion of \"Battle Stations\". The United States Coast Guard's recruit training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap.\n\nFor honor graduates of basic training, the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy present a [[Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon]]. The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay-grade (up to a maximum of E-3).\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Army===\n[[File:Drill-push.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army recruits being instructed]]\n{{Main|United States Army Basic Training}}\n\nIn the [[United States Army]], recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military [[Military Occupational Specialty]], or MOS, which is selected upon enlistment.\n\nInitial Entry Training (IET) is divided into two parts, which commonly take place at two different locations, depending on the chosen MOS:\n*Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is a ten-week training cycle. This period does not include \"Reception Week\" during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies (troops for cavalry).\n*Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS. The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year.\n*Several MOSs (mainly combat arms) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which can last up to 22 weeks. The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle, including drill instructors.  Essentially, OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training, especially for Infantry OSUT, which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle, although in greater detail. Infantry OSUT is conducted at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, and lasts up to 22 weeks as of 2019.\nThe U.S. Army has four sites for BCT:\n*[[Fort Benning]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]\n*[[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n*[[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in [[St. Robert, Missouri]]\n*[[Fort Sill]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]\n\nDuring Basic Combat Training, Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including: Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM), land navigation, patrolling, securing and defending a position, drill and ceremony, fireteam formations and assaults, communications and use of AN/PRC-119 radio, combat lifesaving skills, 9-line medevac, reporting intelligence, hand grenades, Claymore mines, M203/M320 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), M240B machine gun, M2 .50 caliber machine gun, MK-19, and AT-4 anti-tank weapon. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, the Confidence Course, conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles, physical training, and Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP), a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, and a number of others.<ref>[[Combatives#Modern Army Combatives]]</ref> Recruits are trained to adopt the Army \"Warrior Ethos\", and to memorize and live by the [[Soldier's Creed]].\n\nBCT is divided into three phases. During Phase I, (also known as \"Red Phase\") recruits are subject to \"Total Control,\" meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants. The first week of training is commonly referred to as \"Hell Week,\" due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits. Marches are common throughout basic training. Recruits are sent to the \"gas chamber\" during Phase I, as part of training for defensive chemical warfare. They are also introduced to their standard-issue weapon, the [[M16A2 rifle]], the [[M16A4]] rifle, or [[M4 carbine]].\n\nIn Phase II (also known as \"White Phase\") soldiers begin actually firing weapons, starting with the rifle or carbine ([[M4A1]]). Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades (such as the M67 fragmentation grenade) and grenade launchers (such as the M203). Recruits are then familiarized with the [[bayonet]], anti-tank/armor weaponry and other heavy weapons. The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time. Additionally, Phase II includes continual, intense PT, along with drill and ceremony training. At the conclusion of Phase II, Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained.\n\nPhase III or \"Blue Phase,\" is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases. A final PT test is administered during the first week. Recruits who fail are frequently retested, often up until the morning of their cycle's graduation. If they do not pass, then they are recycled to another platoon that is in an earlier phase of the training cycle until they meet the fitness standards. The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). Usually, a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category (pushups, sit-ups, and 2 mile run) to pass, but in Basic Combat Training, only 50 points are required; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT. During Blue Phase, the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive \"bivouac\" and FTX ([[Field Training Exercise]]s) as nighttime combat operations. Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans, etc.\n\nUpon completion of Basic Combat Training, a recruit is now a soldier, and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment, as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS-specific duties under fire.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\n{{Main|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}\n[[File:Marine-drill-instructor.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructor works with enlistees, or individuals who have not left yet for recruit training.

Since the 1990s, they are referred to as \"(the) recruit(s)\" alone until they earn the title of Marine.\n\nMarine Corps Recruit Training (MCRT) is a 13-week program that is divided up into three four-week phases and further broken down into individual training days.<ref name=\"mcrt-1\">\n{{cite web\n | url =http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/recruit-training\n | title =Recruit Training\n | website =Marines\n | access-date =2016-12-19\n | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161219185749/http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/recruit-training/\n | archive-date =2016-12-19\n | url-status =live\n }}\n</ref> While there are 69 individual training days, recruits also go through pre- and post-training processing where recruits are afforded relatively little freedom. Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol, physical training, [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program|MCMAP]] training, academic classes, initial drill, a series inspection, and the confidence course. West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase. Phase two is completely in the field at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] for west coast recruits, with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle, and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations, land navigation, and hikes. For east coast recruits, phase two is swim qualification, rifle qualification, and Team Week, a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail. Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill, final inspection, more PT and confidence courses, and graduation. During third phase, west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event. Parris Island recruits finish with field training, final drill and inspection, the Crucible, and graduation. Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training, if in a different order. An important part of this process is training recruits to adopt and live by the motto, \"Every Marine a rifleman\".<ref>{{citation_needed|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion, recruits proceed to receive further training at the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|School of Infantry (SOI)]].

Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, conducting marches, physical training, and Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. Upon completion of Marine Combat Training, the Marine is to have gained the knowledge and ability to operate in a combat environment as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her primary duties under fire.<ref>[[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry]]</ref> (The main contrast with Army recruit training is that nearly identical training is integrated into Basic Combat Training, so there is no follow-on school.) Upon completion, Marines proceed to their MOS-specific school.\n\nIn Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), [[infantry]] [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|MOS]] (03XX) Marines receive 59 days of training in infantry skills, including advanced marksmanship, combat patrolling, land navigation, and a wide array of other infantry skills. Upon completion of ITB, newly qualified Marine infantrymen proceed to their assigned units.\n\n===U.S. Navy===\n[[File:Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|In March 2002, a U.S. Navy Recruit Division Commander conducts \"Instructional Training\" to correct substandard performance during boot camp.]]\n{{Main|Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois}}\nThe [[United States Navy]] currently operates boot camp at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], near [[North Chicago, Illinois]]. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example, 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the [[M9 pistol]] and [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the [[M16 rifle|M16]] in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various \"A\" Schools located across the United States\u2014where they begin training to receive their [[List of United States Navy ratings|ratings]] (jobs)\u2014or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.\n\nThe Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego, California; Orlando, Florida; Meridian, Mississippi; and [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Port Deposit (Bainbridge), Maryland]]. From 1942 to 1946\u2014during and immediately following World War II\u2014the Navy had two additional training sites: Naval Training Station (USNTS) Sampson (renamed [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in 1950), near Seneca Lake, New York, where over 400,000 recruits were trained, and [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho.\n\n===U.S. Air Force===\n[[File:Air Force Military Training Instructor.jpg|thumb|upright|A formation of USAF airmen]]\n{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}\nThe U.S. Air Force's Basic Military Training (BMT) is eight and a half weeks long, as they do not count the first week (\"Week 0\"). BMT is 63 calendar days long. It is conducted at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formerly, trainees were referred to as \"Airman\" from day one of BMT. This has been changed; now, personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman's Coin Ceremony in the eighth week of training, when they receive their Airman's Coin.  Trainees receive military instruction (including the Air Force core values, flight and individual drill, and living area inspections), academic classes (covering topics such as Air Force history, dress and appearance, military customs and courtesies, ethics, security, and alcohol/drug abuse prevention and treatment), and field training (including protection against biological and chemical attack, basic marksmanship on the [[M4 carbine]] as well as self-aid buddy care).  Following BMT, Airmen go to a technical school (or 'tech school') where they learn the specifics of their [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC), which is equivalent to the MOS ([[Military Occupational Specialty]]) in the Army and Marines, the Navy's NEC (Naval Enlisted Classification) code, or the Coast Guard's ratings.\n\nAll non-prior-service enlistees are required to complete BMT, including those enlisting in the [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]]. Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active-duty counterparts. Credit can be given on a case-by-case basis for enlistees with college credit, Eagle Scouts and service in the [[Civil Air Patrol]] qualify for promotion to E-2 ([[Airman]]) or E-3 ([[Airman First Class]]) upon graduation from BMT. The stripes are not worn until graduation, though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade.\n\nLackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force's entire history. From 1950 to 1956, 300,000 airmen received BMT at [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in New York.  In 1951, [[Parks Air Force Base]] in [[Dublin, California]] became a BMT center, with training beginning in March 1952. BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959. For a brief time between 1966 and 1968, the Air Force operated a second BMT at [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo Air Force Base]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].\n\nUnlike the Army and Navy, but like the Marine Corps (throughout boot camp) and Coast Guard (during the first section of boot camp), trainees are required to refer to all Airmen, enlisted and NCO's as well as commissioned and warrant officers, as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\". Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement: \"Sir/Ma'am, Trainee (the recruit's surname) reports as ordered\".\n\nAn additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1, 2008, extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks. BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|title=BMT extended, NCOs to learn new languages|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=1 January 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717031836/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|archivedate=17 July 2012}}</ref> In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks. Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks, however, the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman's Week, which is designed to transition trainees to technical training.\n{{clear}}\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard===\n[[File:USCG Basic Training.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs a recruit during basic training.]]\nRecruit training for the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is held at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|title=USCG Recruit Training|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526231653/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|archive-date=26 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Coast Guard base on Government Island (now known as [[Coast Guard Island]]) [[Alameda, California]] was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982. The official standard recruit training cycle lasts eight weeks. A limited number of recruits may face reversion to earlier weeks of training should they exhibit egregious deficiencies in attitude and/or aptitude.\n  \nAs an alternate for those recruits possessing prior military service or civilian job skills, Coast Guard recruit basic training offers an abbreviated route to completion of basic training with the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training program (DEPOT) \"The goal of the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training Course is to produce petty officers who on the basis of their civilian professions, prior military experience, or a combination of both\" are otherwise duly qualified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|title=DEPOT|accessdate=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711191210/http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCoast Guard boot camp covers basic seamanship, drill, military bearing and firefighting. The U.S. Coast Guard is unique among the armed services in that it fires the [[SIG Sauer P229|SIG Sauer P229R]] pistol as well as the [[M16 rifle]] during the training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|title=Military Life|last=Military.com|accessdate=1 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106114450/http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|archive-date=6 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Coast Guard is a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], rather than the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], it is by law and tradition a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As with all military personnel, Coast Guardsmen are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). Due to the Coast Guard's unique mission set \u2013 including [[CONUS]] and [[CONUS#CONUS/OCONUS|OCONUS]] defense operations, search and rescue and maritime law enforcement \u2013 there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and military bearing. Due to its unusual, diverse and difficult mission, the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards. As an example, the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard Academy]] is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates rather than congressional appointment.\n\nDuring their time at Cape May, recruits are subjected to the usual \"boot camp\" atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation. Recruits must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders. The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits (SR; E-1). Unique to the Coast Guard among the armed services, recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice/Fireman Apprentice (SA/FA; E-2) or Seaman/Fireman (SN/FN; E-3) upon graduation\u2014the difference generally based on level of higher education the graduate possesses. Coast Guard drill instructors are called \"company commanders\" and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8). Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits.\n\nAfter completing boot camp, recruits can select their rating and then attend an \"A\" school. Few graduates go straight to \"A\" school; most spend up to a year in the fleet as \"non-rates\". \"A\" school is a long-term technical school providing specific instruction about a rating. The \"A\" schools last two to six months and usually occur at [[Training Center Yorktown|TRACEN Yorktown]], [[Yorktown, Virginia]] or [[Training Center Petaluma|TRACEN Petaluma]], [[Petaluma, California]]. Aviation related ratings train at the Aviation Technical Training Center at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City]], [[North Carolina]]. Some ratings have an available on-the-job apprenticeship training option known as \"striking\" instead of attending an \"A\" school.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military education and training]]\n*[[Milling (military training exercise)|Milling]] - military training exercise\n*[[Military Academy]]\n*[[Officer Candidate School]]\n*[[Resocialization]]\n*[[Psychological conditioning]]\n*[[Military recruitment]]\n*[[Military service]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* USAREC (2003).

1720s manuscript with the five arias does not name the instruments for which it is scored: these are assumed to be [[string section|strings]], that is [[violin]]s (vl), [[viola]] (va) and [[basso

The [[soprano clef]] for the singer indicates a soprano voice for all arias. They are in different [[key (music)|key]]s, and all of them are da capo arias. The fourth aria, that is \"{{Lang|de|Bist du bei mir|italic=no}}\", is in E-flat major (although notated with only two flats at the clef), and has the most extended instrumentation: first violin (vl1), second violin (vl2), viola and continuo. It is also the only aria with a [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] indicator: {{lang|it|semper piano}} (soft throughout). Apart from the second aria, which seems to be an addition to the 7th scene of the 3rd act, all texts of the five arias score correspond with passages of the libretto of 1718, thus the lyrics of these arias can be coupled with the characters of the [[dramatis personae]] of the opera.{{sfn|Gl\u00f6ckner et al.|2002|pp=173\u2013174}}<ref name=\"SBBmanuscript\">[http://resolver.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/SBB00019D7700000000 (Sammelhandschrift) 11 Geistliche Ges\u00e4nge] at [[Berlin State Library]] website, [http://resolver.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/SBB00019D7700000129 pp.&nbsp;129\u2013131].</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Extant arias of St\u00f6lzel's ''Diomedes''{{sfn|Gl\u00f6ckner et al.|2002|pp=173\u2013174}}<ref name=\"11SacredSongsRISM\">[https://opac.rism.info/search?id=469080800 Collection: 11 Sacred songs] at [[RISM]] website.</ref> \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" | text incipit\n! scope=\"col\" | character\n! scope=\"col\" | scene\n! scope=\"col\" | signature\n! scope=\"col\" | instruments\n|-\n| {{0}}1.\n| Es ist die Ursach' meines Leidens\n| Diomedes\n| data-sort-value=\"II 11\" | Act&nbsp;II, sc.&nbsp;11\n| [[F&nbsp;major]]; {{music|time|3|4}}\n| vl va bc<ref>{{RISM|469080807}}.</ref>\n|-\n| {{0}}2.\n| Geht ihr K\u00fcsse geht ihr Blicke\n| Mosthenes\n| data-sort-value=\"III 07\" | Act&nbsp;III, sc.&nbsp;7\n| [[G&nbsp;major]]; {{music|time|3|8}}\n| vl bc<ref>{{RISM|469080808}}.</ref>\n|-\n| {{0}}3.\n| Mein Gl\u00fccke steht in deinen H\u00e4nden\n| Copele\n| data-sort-value=\"II 06\" | Act&nbsp;II, sc.&nbsp;6\n| [[A&nbsp;major]]; {{music|time|3|4}}\n| vl va bc<ref>{{RISM|469080809}}.</ref>\n|-\n| {{0}}4.\n| '''Bist du bei mir geh ich mit Freuden'''\n| Diomedes\n| data-sort-value=\"III 08\" | Act&nbsp;III, sc.&nbsp;8\n| [[E\u266d&nbsp;major]]; {{music|time|3|4}}\n| vl1 vl2 va bc<ref name=\"BdbmRISM\" />\n|-\n| {{0}}5.\n| Sage mir doch wertes Gl\u00fccke\n| Desania\n| data-sort-value=\"I 05\" | Act&nbsp;I, sc.&nbsp;5\n| [[A&nbsp;minor]]; {{music|time|3|8}}\n| vl va bc<ref>{{RISM|469080811}}.</ref>\n|}\n\n===Anna Magdalena Bach's ''Notenb\u00fcchlein''===\n{{see also|Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach}}\n[[Anna Magdalena Wilcke]] was an accomplished vocalist when she married Johann Sebastian Bach in 1721, around which time she was hired as a singer by his employer at [[K\u00f6then (Anhalt)|K\u00f6then]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA216 216]}}{{sfn|Yearsley|2019|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8bGhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19 XIX]}} A year later, her first notebook was started: it contains, as far as extant, only keyboard music, most of it written down by Johann Sebastian.{{sfn|Yearsley|2019|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8bGhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19 XIX\u2013XXI]}}{{sfn|1.

The fourth aria, that is \"{{Lang|de|Bist du bei mir|italic=no}}\", is in E-flat major (although notated with only two flats at the clef), and has the most extended instrumentation: first violin (vl1), second violin (vl2), viola and continuo.

Originally built and owned by the Charlotte and South Carolina Railway in 1852 was acquired by the Southern Railway in 1892. Trains continue to operate on the R-Line today and are all operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway. Trains Historically ran from Augusta, GA to Downtown Charlotte direct without using the Present day Norfolk Southern Charlotte District. In 1950 The Berryhill Cutoff was created connecting the R-line in South Charlotte to the Piedmont Division Via. Charlotte Junction keeping traffic of the South Charlotte to Uptown Charlotte Segment. Locals ran on the short segment of track until 1990.

Palmerston dominated British foreign policy during the period 1830 to 1865, when Britain was at the height of its imperial power. He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865. He began his parliamentary career as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]], defected to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in 1830, and became the first Prime Minister of the newly formed [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1859.\n\nPalmerston succeeded to his father's [[Irish peerage]] in 1802. He became a Tory MP in 1807 (his Irish peerage did not bar him from a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], because it did not entitle him to a seat in the [[House of Lords]]). From 1809 to 1828 he served as [[Secretary at War]], in which post he was responsible for the organisation of the finances of the army. He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827, when [[George Canning]] became Prime Minister, but, like other [[Canningites]], he resigned from office one year later.\n\nHe served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] 1830\u201334,  1835\u201341, and 1846\u201351. In this office, Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe. His belligerent actions as Foreign Secretary, some of which were highly controversial, have been considered to be prototypes of the practice of [[Interventionism (politics)|liberal interventionism]].\n\nPalmerston became [[Home Secretary]] in [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]]'s coalition government, in 1852, subsequent to the [[Peelite]] advocacy of the appointment of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] to the office of Foreign Secretary. As Home Secretary, Palmerston enacted various social reforms, although he opposed electoral reform. When public antipathy over the Government's policy in the [[Crimean War]] lost the Government popular favour, in 1855, Palmerston was the only Prime Minister who was able to sustain a majority in Parliament.  He had two periods in office, 1855\u20131858 and 1859\u20131865, before his death at the age of 80 years, a few months after victory in a [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in which he had achieved an increased majority. He remains, to date, the last Prime Minister to die in office.\n\nPalmerston masterfully controlled public opinion by stimulating [[British nationalism]], and, despite the fact that [[Queen Victoria]] and most of the political leadership distrusted him, he received and sustained the favour of the press and the populace, from whom he received the affectionate sobriquet 'Pam'. Palmerston's alleged weaknesses included mishandling of personal relations, and continual disagreements with the Queen over the royal role in determining foreign policy.<ref>Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Nineteenth Century 1814\u201380'' (1975) p 108</ref>\n\nHistorians consider Palmerston to be one of the greatest foreign secretaries, as a consequence of his handling of great crises, his commitment to the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]], which provided Britain with decisive agency in many conflicts, his analytic skills, and his commitment to British interests. His policies in relation to [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] had extensive long-lasting beneficial consequences for Britain: although the consequences of his policies toward [[France]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[United States]] were more ephemeral.\n\n==Early life: 1784\u20131806==\n[[Image:Palmerston 1802.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 18) in 1802, by [[Thomas Heaphy]]]]\nHenry John Temple was born in his family's [[Westminster]] house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd [[Viscount Palmerston]] upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the [[Peerage of Ireland]], although the 3rd [[Viscount]] would almost never visit [[Ireland]]. His father was [[Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston|The 2nd Viscount Palmerston]] (1739\u20131802), an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer, and his mother was Mary (1752\u20131805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Edward J. | year = 2008 | title = The Ancestry of Lord Palmerston | url = | journal = The Genealogist | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 62\u201377 }}</ref> From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour.

The young 3rd Lord Palmerston also inherited a vast [[country estate]] in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]]. He later built [[Classiebawn Castle]] on this estate. Palmerston went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] (1803\u20131806).<ref>{{acad|id=PLMN803HJ|name=Palmerston, Henry John (Temple), Viscount}}</ref> As a nobleman, he was entitled to take his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] without examinations, but Palmerston wished to obtain his degree through examinations.

Palmerston was thus able to serve as an MP.</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1808 Palmerston spoke in support of confidentiality in the working of diplomacy and the bombardment of Copenhagen and the capture and destruction of the Danish navy by the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: a biography'' (2011) p 57.</ref>  Denmark was neutral but [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] had recently agreed with the Russians in the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] to build a naval alliance against Britain, including using the Danish navy for invading Britain.<ref>Ridley, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> Pre-empting this, the British offered Denmark the choice of temporarily handing over its navy until the war's end or the destruction of their navy. The Danes refused to comply and so Copenhagen was bombarded. Palmerston justified the attack by peroration with reference to the ambitions of Napoleon to take control of the Danish fleet:\n\n<blockquote>it is defensible on the ground that the enormous power of France enables her to coerce the weaker state to become an enemy of England...It is the law of self-preservation that England appeals for the justification of her proceedings. It is admitted by the honourable gentleman and his supporters, that if Denmark had evidenced any hostility towards this country, then we should have been justified in measures of retaliation...Denmark coerced into hostility stands in the same position as Denmark voluntarily hostile, when the law of self-preservation comes into play...Does anyone believe that Buonaparte will be restrained by any considerations of justice from acting towards Denmark as he has done towards other countries?...England, according to that law of self-preservation which is a fundamental principle of the law of nations, is justified in securing, and therefore enforcing, from Denmark a neutrality which France would by compulsion have converted into an active hostility.<ref>George Henry Francis, ''Opinions and Policy of the Right Honourable Viscount Palmerston, G.C.B., M.P., &c. as Minister, Diplomatist, and Statesman, During More Than Forty Years of Public Life'' (1852), pp. 1\u20133.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a letter to a friend on 24 December 1807, Palmerston described the late Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] as possessing \"the palm of political prophecy\".<ref>Kenneth Bourne (ed.), ''The Letters of the Third Viscount Palmerston to Laurence and Elizabeth Sulivan. 1804\u20131863'' (London: The Royal Historical Society, 1979), p. 97.</ref> This would become a metaphor for his own career in divining the course of imperial foreign policy.\n\n==Secretary at War: 1809\u20131828==\n[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|The [[British Empire]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815]]\nPalmerston's speech was so successful that [[Spencer Perceval]], who formed his government in 1809, asked him to become [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], then a less important office than it was to become from the mid nineteenth century. Palmerston preferred the office of [[Secretary at War]], charged exclusively with the financial business of the army. Without a seat in the cabinet until 1827, he remained in the latter post for 20 years.<ref>Dick Leonard, ''Nineteenth Century British Premieres: Pitt to Roseberry'' (2008) pp 249\u201351</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 1818 a retired officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, who had a grievance about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as he walked up the stairs of the War Office. The bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies was mad, he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]).<ref>Ridley, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nAfter the suicide of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] in 1822, the Cabinet of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s Tory administration began to split along political lines. The more liberal wing of the Tory government made some ground, with [[George Canning]] becoming [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Huskisson]] advocating and applying the doctrines of free trade, and [[Catholic emancipation]] emerging as an open question. Although Palmerston was not in the Cabinet, he cordially supported the measures of Canning and his friends.\n\nUpon the retirement of Lord Liverpool in April 1827, Canning was called to be Prime Minister. The more conservative Tories, including [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], withdrew their support, and an alliance was formed between the liberal members of the late ministry and the Whigs. The post of Chancellor of the Exchequer was offered to Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was frustrated by some intrigue between the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[John Charles Herries]]. Palmerston remained Secretary at War, though he gained a seat in the cabinet for the first time. The Canning administration ended after only four months on the death of the Prime Minister, and was followed by the ministry of [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]], which barely survived the year.\n\nThe [[Canningites]] remained influential, and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] hastened to include Palmerston, Huskisson, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Charles Grant]], [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]], and [[John William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|The Earl of Dudley]] in the government he subsequently formed. However, a dispute between Wellington and Huskisson over the issue of parliamentary representation for Manchester and Birmingham led to the resignation of Huskisson and his allies, including Palmerston. In the spring of 1828, after more than twenty years continuously in office, Palmerston found himself in opposition.\n\nOn 26 February 1828 Palmerston delivered a speech in favour of Catholic Emancipation.  He felt that it was unseemly to relieve the \"imaginary grievances\" of the Dissenters from the established church while at the same time \"real afflictions pressed upon the Catholics\" of Great Britain.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1828/feb/26/repeal-of-the-test-and-corporation-acts REPEAL OF THE TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.

He had already urged Wellington into active interference in the [[Greek War of Independence]], and he had made several visits to [[Paris]], where he foresaw with great accuracy the impending overthrow of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons]]. On 1 June 1829 he made his first great speech on foreign affairs.\n{{Quote\n|text=Lord Palmerston was no orator; his language was unstudied, and his delivery somewhat embarrassed; but generally he found the words to say the right thing at the right time, and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience.\n|title=\"Lord Palmerston\" |source=\"Encyclopaedia Britannica 13th Edition\"\n}} \nAn attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] and [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.<ref>Ridley, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1830\u20131841==\nPalmerston entered the office with great energy and continued to exert his influence there for twenty years; he held it from 1830 to 1834 \u2013 his apprentice years<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 70-1</ref> - 1835 to 1841, and 1846 to 1851. Basically, Palmerston was responsible for the whole of British foreign policy from the time of the French and Belgian Revolutions of 1830 until December 1851.  His abrasive style would earn him the nickname \"Lord Pumice Stone\", and his manner of dealing with foreign governments who crossed him, especially in his later years,<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 232</ref> was the original  \"[[gunboat diplomacy]]\".<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 143-88.</ref>\n\n===Crises of 1830===\nThe [[revolutions of 1830]] gave a jolt to the settled European system that had been created in 1814\u201315.

[[Congress Poland|Poland]] was in arms against the [[Russian Empire]], while the northern powers (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) formed a closer alliance that seemed to threaten the peace and liberties of Europe. Polish exiles called on Britain to intervene against Russia during the [[November Uprising]] of 1830.<ref>R. W.

He had no grievance against Russia and while he privately sympathized with the Polish cause, in his role as foreign minister he rejected Polish demands. With serious trouble simultaneously taking place in Belgium and Italy, and lesser issues in Greece and Portugal, he sought to de-escalate European tensions rather than aggravate them, favouring a policy of universal non-interventionism.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 72</ref>  He therefore focused chiefly on achieving a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Belgium.<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp. 148\u201354.</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n[[William I of the Netherlands]] appealed to the great powers that had placed him on the throne after the Napoleonic Wars to maintain his rights. The [[London Conference of 1830]] was called to address this question. The British solution involved the independence of Belgium, which Palmerston believed would greatly contribute to the security of Britain, but any solution was not straightforward. On the one hand, the northern powers were anxious to defend William I; on the other, many Belgian revolutionaries, like [[Charles de Brouck\u00e8re]] and [[Charles Rogier]], supported the reunion of the Belgian provinces to France, whereas Britain favoured Dutch, not French influence, on an independent state.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 20</ref>\n\nThe British policy which emerged was a close alliance with France,<ref name=\"E Halevy, 1961 p. 73\">E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 73</ref>  but one subject to the balance of power on the Continent, and in particular the preservation of Belgium independence. If the northern powers supported William I by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and Britain united in arms. If France sought to annex Belgium, it would forfeit the British alliance and find herself opposed by the whole of Europe. In the end the British policy prevailed.<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 233</ref> Although the continent had been close to war, peace was maintained on London's terms and Prince [[L\u00e9opold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg]], the widower of a British princess, was placed upon the throne of Belgium.

Their positions were under some pressure from their absolutist kinsmen, Dom [[Miguel of Portugal]] and [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]] of Spain, who were the closest males in the lines of succession. Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a quadruple alliance of the constitutional states of the West to serve as a counterpoise to the northern alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on 22 April 1834 and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain, it accomplished its objective.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 153-72.</ref>\n\nFrance had been a reluctant party to the treaty, and never executed its role in it with much zeal. [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] was accused of secretly favouring the [[Carlism|Carlists]] \u2013 the supporters of Don Carlos \u2013 and he rejected direct interference in Spain. It is probable that the hesitation of the French court on this question was one of the causes of the enduring personal hostility Palmerston showed towards the French King thereafter, though that sentiment may well have arisen earlier. Although Palmerston wrote in June 1834 that Paris was \"the pivot of my foreign policy\", the differences between the two countries grew into a constant but sterile rivalry that brought benefit to neither.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Lytton Bulwer|title=The Life of Henry John Temple Viscount Palmerston: With Selections from His Diaries and Correspondence|publisher=Richard Bentley|url=https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog|year=1871|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog/page/n174 170]}}</ref>\n\n===Balkans and Near East: defending Turkey, 1830s===\nPalmerston was greatly interested by the diplomatic questions of Eastern Europe. During the [[Greek War of Independence]] he had energetically supported the Greek cause and backed the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] that gave Greece its independence. However, from 1830 the defence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] became one of the cardinal objects of his policy. He believed in the regeneration of Turkey, as he wrote to Bulwer (Lord Dalling): \"All that we hear about the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure unadulterated nonsense.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SpLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA647|year=1911|page=647}}</ref>\n\nHis two great aims were to prevent Russia establishing itself on the [[Bosporus]] and to prevent France doing likewise on the Nile.

He was angered by the 1833 [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]], a mutual assistance pact between Russia and the Ottomans, but was annoyed and hostile towards [[David Urquhart]], the creator of the [[Mission of the Vixen|Vixen affair]], running the Russian blockade of [[Circassia]] in the mid-1830s.<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 210-11.</ref> \n\nFor his part, David Urquhart considered Palmerston a \"mercenary of Russia\" and founded the \"Free Press\" magazine in London, where he constantly promoted these views. The permanent author of this magazine was Karl Marx, who stated \"from the time of Peter the Great until the Crimean war, there was a secret agreement between the London and St. Petersburg offices, and that Palmerston was a corrupt tool the Tsar policy\" <ref>Franz Mering. \"Karl Marx.

Palmerston held that \"if we can procure for it ten years of peace under the joint protection of the five Powers, and if those years are profitably employed in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, there is no reason whatever why it should not become again a respectable Power\" and challenged the metaphor that an old country, such as Turkey should be in such disrepair as would be warranted by the comparison: \"Half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Evelyn M.

However, by 1840 Muhammad Ali had occupied [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and won the [[Battle of Nezib]] against the Turkish forces. [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Lord Ponsonby]], the British ambassador at Constantinople, vehemently urged the British government to intervene. Having closer ties to the pasha than most, France refused to be a party to coercive measures against him despite having signed the note in the previous year.<ref>Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 191-98.</ref>\n\nPalmerston, irritated at France's Egyptian policy, signed the [[Convention of London (1840)|London Convention]] of 15 July 1840 in London with [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] \u2013 without the knowledge of the French government.  This measure was taken with great hesitation, and strong opposition on the part of several members of the cabinet.  Palmerston forced the measure through in part by declaring in a letter to the Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], that he would resign from the ministry if his policy were not adopted.\nThe London Convention granted Muhammad Ali hereditary rule in Egypt in return for withdrawal from Syria and Lebanon, but was rejected by the pasha.  The European powers intervened with force, and the bombardment of [[Beirut]], the fall of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and the total collapse of Muhammad Ali's power followed in rapid succession.  Palmerston's policy was triumphant, and the author of it had won a reputation as one of the most powerful statesmen of the age.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston,'' pp. 248\u201360</ref>\n\nIn September 1838, Palmerston appointed a British consul in Jerusalem, without the conventional consultation of the Board of Trade, and gave instruction to assist with the construction of an Anglican church in the city, under the prompting influences of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], a prominent [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionist]].<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year=2014 | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref>\n\n===China: First Opium War===\n{{See also|Destruction of opium at Humen}}\n[[File:Canton from the Heights.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|British bombardment of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] from the surrounding heights, May 1841]]\n\nChina restricted trade under the [[Canton System]] (a similar policy to the policies of various European countries<ref>{{cite book |last1=Peer Vries |title=State, Economy and the Great Divergence: Great Britain and China, 1680s-1850s |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1472526403 |pages=353\u2013354}}</ref> ) and permitted official diplomatic relations only to tributary countries. Palmerston saw this as an affront to his free trade principles, and demanded reform, sending [[William Napier, 9th Lord Napier|Lord Napier]] to negotiate in 1834. China refused, and interdicted the British smugglers bringing in [[History of opium in China|opium]] from India, which was banned in China. The upshot was the [[First Opium War]], 1839\u201342, which ended in the conquest of [[Zhoushan|Chusan]] by [[Henry Pottinger]]. It was later exchanged for the island of [[Hong Kong]]. Under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]], China paid an indemnity and opened five [[treaty ports]] to world trade. Palmerston thus achieved his main goal of opening China to trade, although his critics focused on the immorality of the opium trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Glenn Melancon|title=Britain's China Policy and the Opium Crisis: Balancing Drugs, Violence and National Honour, 1833\u20131840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V527VTyT29gC&pg=PA126|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate |isbn=9780754607045}}</ref>\n\nIn all these actions Palmerston brought to bear a great deal of patriotic vigour and energy. This made him very popular among the ordinary people of Britain, but his passion, propensity to act through personal animosity, and imperious language made him seem dangerous and destabilising in the eyes of the queen and his more conservative colleagues in government.  Meanwhile he manipulated information and public opinion to enhance his control of his department, including controlling communications within the office and to other officials. He leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control and more publicity, all the while stirring up British nationalism.<ref>John K.

The crisis was past, but the change which took place by the substitution of [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] for [[Adolphe Thiers]] in France, and of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] for Palmerston in Britain was a fortunate event for the peace of the world. Palmerston had adopted the opinion that peace with France was not to be relied on, and indeed that war between the two countries was sooner or later inevitable. Aberdeen and Guizot inaugurated a different policy: by mutual confidence and friendly offices, they entirely succeeded in restoring the most cordial understanding between the two governments, and the irritation which Palmerston had inflamed gradually subsided. During the administration of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], Palmerston led a retired life, but he attacked with characteristic bitterness the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with the United States. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 resolved several Canadian boundary disputes with the United States, particularly the border between [[New Brunswick]] and the State of [[Maine]] and between Canada and the State of [[Minnesota]] from Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. Much as he criticised it, the treaty successfully closed the border questions with which Palmerston had long been concerned.<ref>Robert Remini, ''Daniel Webster'' (W. W. Norton and Co.: New York, 1997) pp. 538\u2013565.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's reputation as an interventionist and his unpopularity with the Queen and other grandees was such that [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] attempt in December 1845 to form a ministry failed because [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] refused to join a government in which Palmerston would direct foreign affairs. A few months later, however, the Whigs returned to power and Palmerston to the Foreign Office (July 1846). Russell replied to critics that Palmerston's policies had \"a ''tendency'' to produce war\" but that he had advanced British interests without a major conflict, if not entirely peaceably.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1846\u20131851==\nPalmerston's years as foreign secretary, 1846-1851, involve dealing with violent upheavals all over Europe \u2013 he has been dubbed \"the gunpowder minister\" by biographer David Brown.<ref>David Brown., ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 279\u2013333.</ref>\n\n===France and Spain, 1845===\n{{Main|Affair of the Spanish Marriages}}\n[[Image:Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Palmerston, c. 1845]]\nThe French government regarded the appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities. They availed themselves of a dispatch in which he had put forward the name of a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain as a justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. However little the conduct of the French government in this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is certain that it originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] and the other powers of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small loss of honourable reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ewing Ritchie|title=The life and times of viscount Palmerston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kABAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA648|year=1866|page=648}}</ref>\n\nHistorian David Brown rejects the traditional interpretation to the effect that Aberdeen had forged an entente cordiale with France in the early 1840s whereupon the belligerent Palmerston after 1846 destroyed that friendly relationship.

Palmerston sympathised openly with the revolutionary party abroad. In particular, he was a strong advocate of [[national self-determination]], and stood firmly on the side of constitutional liberties on the Continent. Despite this, he was bitterly opposed to [[Irish nationalism|Irish independence]], and deeply hostile to the [[Young Ireland]] movement.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 241-49.</ref>\n\n===Italian independence===\nNo state was regarded by him with more aversion than [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Yet, his opposition to Austria was chiefly based upon its occupation of northeastern Italy and [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|its Italian policy]]. Palmerston maintained that the existence of Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in the political views of Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been passionately awakened by the cause of [[Italian unification|Italian independence]]. He supported the Sicilians against the [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King]] of [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Naples]], and even allowed arms to be sent them from the arsenal at Woolwich. Although he had endeavoured to restrain the [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|King]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] from his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an envoy to London to request the mediation of Britain, based on a large cession of Italian territory. Palmerston rejected the terms he might have obtained for Piedmont. After a couple of years this wave of revolution was replaced by a wave of reaction.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 343-48.</ref><ref>Herbert C. F.

[[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] assumed the government of the empire with dictatorial power. In spite of what Palmerston termed his judicious bottle-holding, the movement he had encouraged and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere subdued. The British government, or at least Palmerston as its representative, was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the French republic.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 355.</ref> Even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by Palmerston's attack on Greece. When [[Lajos Kossuth]], the Hungarian democrat and leader of its constitutionalists, landed in England in 1851 to wide applause, Palmerston proposed to receive him at Broadlands, a design which was only prevented by a peremptory vote of the cabinet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Laurence Fenton|title=Palmerston and the Times: Foreign Policy, the Press and Public Opinion in Mid-Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbXpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119|year=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=119\u201320|isbn=9780857736512}}</ref>\n\n===Royal and parliamentary reaction to 1848===\nThis state of things was regarded with the utmost annoyance by the British court and by most of the British ministers. On many occasions, Palmerston had taken important steps without their knowledge, which they disapproved.  Over the [[Foreign Office]] he asserted and exercised an arbitrary dominion, which the feeble efforts of the premier could not control. The Queen and the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] did not conceal their indignation at the fact that they were held responsible for Palmerston's actions by the other Courts of Europe.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 333-58.</ref>\n\nWhen Disraeli attacked Palmerston's foreign policy, the foreign minister responded to a five-hour speech by [[Thomas Chisholm Anstey|Anstey]] with a five-hour speech of his own, the first of two great speeches in which he laid out a comprehensive defence of his foreign policy and of liberal interventionism more generally. Arguing for domestic political effect, Palmerston declaimed:\n:I hold that the real policy of England... is to be the champion of justice and right, pursuing that course with moderation and prudence, not becoming the [[Don Quixote (character)|Quixote]] of the world, but giving the weight of her moral sanction and support wherever she thinks that justice is, and whenever she thinks that wrong has been done.<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd Hilton|title=A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783-1846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDFHmqU_6SEC&pg=PR248|year=2006|page=247|isbn=9780191606823}}</ref>\n\nRussell and the Queen both hoped that the other would take the initiative and dismiss Palmerston; the Queen was dissuaded by her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who took the limits of constitutional power very seriously, and Russell by Palmerston's prestige with the people and his competence in an otherwise remarkably inept Cabinet.\n\n===Don Pacifico Affair===\n{{main|Don Pacifico Affair}}\nIn 1847 the home of [[Don Pacifico]], a Gibraltarian merchant living in Athens, Greece, was attacked by an anti-Semitic mob which included the sons of a Greek government minister. The Greek police did not intervene in the attack, despite being present.<ref>Ridley, pp. 374\u2013375.</ref> Because Don Pacifico was a British subject, the British government expressed concern.

The House of Commons was moved by [[John Arthur Roebuck|Roebuck]] to reverse the rebuke, which it did on 29 June by a majority of 46, after having heard from Palmerston on 25 June. This was the most eloquent and powerful speech he ever delivered, wherein he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs.\n{{wikisource|Don Pacifico Speech}}\nIt was in this speech, which lasted for five hours, that Palmerston made the well known declaration that a British subject ought everywhere to be protected by the strong arm of the British government against injustice and wrong; comparing the reach of the British Empire to that of the Roman Empire, in which a Roman citizen could walk the earth unmolested by any foreign power. This was the famous ''[[Civis Romanus sum]]'' (\"I am a citizen of Rome\") speech. After this speech, Palmerston's popularity had never been greater.<ref>Ridley, pp. 387\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Crossing the Queen and resigning, 1851===\nNotwithstanding his parliamentary triumph in the Don Pacifico affair, many of his own colleagues and supporters criticized the spirit in which the foreign relations of the Crown were carried on. The Queen addressed a minute to the Prime Minister in which she recorded her dissatisfaction at the manner in which Palmerston evaded the obligation to submit his measures for the royal sanction as failing in sincerity to the Crown. This minute was communicated to Palmerston, who accepted its criticisms.<ref>Ridley, pp. 394\u2013395.</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 1851, [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] \u2013 who had been elected President of France in 1848 \u2013 carried out a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by dissolving the National Assembly and arresting the leading Republicans. Palmerston privately congratulated Napoleon on his triumph, noting that Britain's constitution was rooted in history but that France had had five revolutions since 1789, with the [[French Constitution of 1848]] being a \"day-before-yesterday tomfoolery which the scatterbrain heads of [[Armand Marrast|Marrast]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] invented for the torment and perplexity of the French nation\".<ref>Ridley, p. 398.</ref> However, the Cabinet decided that Britain must be neutral, and so Palmerston requested his officials to be diplomatic. Palmerston's widespread support among the press, educated public opinion, and ordinary Britons caused apprehension and distrust among other politicians and angered the Court. Prince Albert complained Palmerston had sent a dispatch without showing the Sovereign. Protesting innocence, Palmerston resigned.<ref>Ridley, pp. 398\u2013399.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = David | year = 2001 | title = The power of public opinion: Palmerston and the crisis of December 1851 | url = | journal = Parliamentary History | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 333\u2013358 }}</ref>\n\n==Home Secretary: 1852\u20131855==\nAfter a brief period of Conservative minority government, the [[George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] became Prime Minister in a coalition government of Whigs and Peelites (with [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]] taking the role of Foreign Secretary and Leader of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]). It was regarded as impossible for them to form a government without Palmerston, so he was made [[Home Secretary]] in December 1852. Many people considered this a curious appointment because Palmerston's expertise was so obviously in foreign affairs.<ref>Ridley, pp. 413\u2013414.</ref> There was a story that after a great wave of strikes swept Northern England, the Queen summoned Palmerston to discuss the situation. When she enquired after the latest news, Palmerston is said to have replied: \"There is no definite news, Madam, but it seems certain that the Turks have crossed the Danube\".<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 414\">Ridley, p. 414.</ref>\n\n===Social reform===\nPalmerston passed the Factory Act 1853 which removed loopholes in previous [[Factory Acts]] and outlawed all labour by young persons between 6pm and 6am.  He attempted to pass a Bill that confirmed the rights of workers to combine but this was thrown out by the House of Lords. He introduced the [[Truck Acts|Truck Act]] which stopped the practice of employers paying workmen in goods instead of money, or forcing them to purchase goods from shops owned by the employers.  In August 1853 Palmerston introduced the Smoke Abatement Act in order to combat the increasing smoke from coal fires, a problem greatly aggravated by the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\">Ridley, p. 407.</ref> He also oversaw the passage of the [[Vaccination Act 1853]] into law, which was introduced as a private member's bill, and which Palmerston persuaded the government to support.  The Act made vaccination of children compulsory for the first time.  Palmerston outlawed the burying of the dead in churches.  The right to bury the dead in churches was held by wealthy families whose ancestors had purchased the right in the past.  Palmerston opposed this practice on public health grounds and ensured that all bodies were buried in a churchyard or public cemetery.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\"/>\n\n===Penal reform===\nPalmerston reduced the period in which prisoners could be held in [[solitary confinement]] from eighteen months to nine months.<ref>Ridley, p. 408.</ref> He also ended transportation to [[Tasmania]] for prisoners by passing the Penal Servitude Act 1853, which also reduced the maximum sentences for most offences.<ref>Ridley, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Palmerston passed the Reformatory Schools Act 1854 which gave the Home Secretary powers to send juvenile prisoners to a reformatory school instead of prison. He was forced to accept an amendment which ensured that the prisoner had to have spent at least three months in jail first.<ref>Ridley, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> When in October 1854 Palmerston visited [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst]] jail and conversed with three boy inmates, he was impressed by their behaviour and ordered that they be sent to a reformatory school. He found the ventilation in the cells unsatisfactory and ordered that they be improved.<ref>Ridley, p. 410.</ref>\n\nPalmerston strongly opposed [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s plans for giving the vote to sections of the urban working-classes. When the Cabinet agreed in December 1853 to introduce a bill during the next session of Parliament in the form which Russell wanted, Palmerston resigned. However, Aberdeen told him that no definite decision on reform had been taken and persuaded Palmerston to return to the Cabinet.  The electoral Reform Bill did not pass Parliament that year.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 403-405.</ref>\n\n===Crimean War===\nPalmerston's exile from his traditional realm of the Foreign Office meant he did not have full control over British policy during the events precipitating the [[Crimean War]]. One of his biographers, [[Jasper Ridley]], argues that had he been in control of foreign policy at this time, war in the Crimea would have been avoided.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 414.</ref> Palmerston argued in Cabinet, after Russian troops concentrated on the Ottoman border in February 1853, that the Royal Navy should join the French fleet in the [[Dardanelles]] as a warning to Russia. He was overruled, however.\n\nIn May 1853 the Russians threatened to invade the principalities [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] unless the Ottoman Sultan surrendered to their demands. Palmerston argued for immediate decisive action; the Royal Navy should be sent to the Dardanelles to assist the Turkish navy and that Britain should inform Russia of the intention to go to war if it invaded the principalities. However, Aberdeen objected to all of Palmerston's proposals. After prolonged arguments, a reluctant Aberdeen agreed to send a fleet to the Dardanelles but objected to his other proposals. The Russian Emperor was annoyed by Britain's actions but it was not enough to deter him. When the British fleet arrived at the Dardanelles the weather was rough so the fleet took refuge in the outer waters of the straits. The Russians argued that this was a violation of the [[Straits Convention]] of 1841 and therefore invaded the two principalities. Palmerston thought that this was the result of British weakness and thought that if the Russians had been told that if they invaded the principalities the British and French fleets would enter the [[Bosphorus]] or the [[Black Sea]], they would have been deterred.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 415\u2013416.</ref> In Cabinet, Palmerston argued for a vigorous prosecution of the war against Russia by Britain but Aberdeen objected, as he wanted peace. Public opinion was on the side of the Turks and with Aberdeen becoming steadily unpopular, [[Lord Dudley Stuart]] in February 1854 noted, \"Wherever I go, I have heard but one opinion on the subject, and that one opinion has been pronounced in a single word, or in a single name \u2013 Palmerston.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:British General Cathcart death at Inkerman.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Battle of Inkerman]], November 1854]]\n\nOn 28 March 1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia for refusing to withdraw from the principalities. The war progressed slowly, with no gains in the Baltic and slow gains in Crimea at the long [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]].  Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos and failures, especially the mismanagement of the heroic [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. The health and living conditions of the British soldiers was notorious and the press, with correspondents in the field, made the most of it. Tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dick |last=Leonard|title=The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|url={{Google books|7Kosl75aYPAC|The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|page=98|plainurl=yes}}|year=2013|publisher=I.B.

Derby offered Palmerston the office of Secretary of State for War which he accepted under the condition that [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] remained as Foreign Secretary. Clarendon refused and so Palmerston refused Derby's offer and Derby subsequently gave up trying to form a government. The Queen sent for [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]] but he was too old to accept:  so she asked Russell; but none of his former colleagues except Palmerston wanted to serve under him. Having exhausted the possible alternatives, the Queen invited Palmerston to Buckingham Palace on 4 February 1855 to form a government.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 433-36.</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1855\u20131858==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[First premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Whig government, 1855\u20131858}}\n\nAged 70 years, 109 days, Palmerston became the oldest person in British political history to be appointed Prime Minister for the first time. As of 2020 no Prime Minister entering [[10 Downing Street]] for the first time since Palmerston has surpassed his record.\n\n===Ending the Crimean War===\n[[File:Lord Palmerston 1855.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Lord Palmerston, c. 1855 by Francis Cruikshank]]\nPalmerston took a hard line on the war; he wanted to expand the fighting, especially in the Baltic where St. Petersburg could be threatened by superior British naval power. His goal was to permanently reduce the Russian threat to Europe. Sweden and Prussia were willing to join, and Russia stood alone. However, France, which had sent far more soldiers to the war than Britain, and had suffered far more casualties, wanted the war to end, as did Austria.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010) pp 402\u2013408</ref>  In March 1855 the old Tsar died and was succeeded by his son, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who wished to make peace. However, Palmerston found the peace terms too soft on Russia and so persuaded [[Napoleon III of France]] to break off the peace negotiations until Sevastopol could be captured, putting the allies in a stronger negotiating position. In September Sevastopol finally surrendered and the allies had full control of the Black Sea theatre. Russia came to terms. On 27 February 1856 an armistice was signed and after a month's negotiations an agreement was signed at the [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Congress of Paris]]. Palmerston's demand for a demilitarised Black Sea was secured, although his wish for the Crimea to be returned to the Ottomans was not. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|peace treaty]] was signed on 30 March 1856. In April 1856 Palmerston was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]] by Victoria.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 437-53/</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Palmerston-engraving.jpg|thumb|Original engraving by D.J.

When the Chinese Commissioner [[Ye Mingchen]] refused to apologize, the British shelled his compound. The commissioner retaliated with a proclamation that called on the people of Canton to \"unite in exterminating these troublesome English villains\" and offered a $100 bounty for the head of any Englishman. The [[Thirteen Factories|British factories]] outside the city were also burned to the ground by incensed locals. Palmerston supported Parkes while in Parliament the British policy was strongly attacked on moral grounds by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[William Gladstone]]. Playing the patriotism card, Palmerston said that Cobden demonstrated \"an anti-English feeling, an abnegation of all those ties which bind men to their country and to their fellow countrymen, which I should hardly have expected from the lips of any member of this House. Everything that was English was wrong, and everything that was hostile to England was right.\"<ref name=R467>Ridley, p. 467.</ref> He went on to say that if a motion of censure was carried it would signal that the House had voted to \"abandon a large community of British subjects at the extreme end of the globe to a set of barbarians \u2013 a set of kidnapping, murdering, poisoning barbarians.\"<ref name=R467/> The censure motion was carried by a majority of sixteen and the [[1857 United Kingdom general election|election of 1857 followed]]. Palmerston's stance proved popular among a large section of the workers, the growing middle classes and the country's commercial and financial interests. With the expanded franchise, his party swept on a wave of popular feeling to a majority of 83, the largest since 1835. Cobden and [[John Bright]] lost their seats.\n\nIn China the [[Second Opium War]] (1856\u20131860) was another humiliating defeat for a Qing dynasty,<ref>J. Y. Wong, ''Deadly Dreams: Opium, Imperialism, and the Arrow War (1856\u20131860) in China'' (1998)</ref> already reeling as a result of the domestic [[Taiping Rebellion]].\n\n===Resignation===\n[[Image:Lord-Palmerston-Addressing-The-House-Of-Commons-During-The-Debates-On-The-Treaty-Of-France-In-February-1860,-1863.jpg|thumb|250px|Lord Palmerston Addressing the House of Commons During the Debates on the [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|Treaty of France]] in February 1860, as painted by [[John Phillip]] (1863)]]\nAfter the election, Palmerston passed the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]], which for the first time made it possible for courts to grant a divorce and removed divorce from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. The opponents in Parliament, who included Gladstone, were the first in British history to try to kill a bill by filibuster. Nonetheless, Palmerston was determined to get the bill through, which he did.  In June news came to Britain of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Palmerston sent Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] and reinforcements to India. Palmerston also agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown. This was enacted in the [[Government of India Act 1858]].  After the Italian republican [[Felice Orsini]] tried to assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see [[Orsini affair]]). Palmerston introduced a Conspiracy to Murder bill, which made it a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. At first reading, the Conservatives voted for it but at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 he was forced to resign.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 472-82.</ref>\n\n==Opposition: 1858\u20131859==\nThe Conservatives lacked a majority, and Russell introduced a resolution in March 1859 arguing for widening the franchise, which the Conservatives opposed but which was carried. Parliament was dissolved and [[1859 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] ensued, which the Whigs won. Palmerston rejected an offer from Disraeli to become Conservative leader, but he attended the meeting of 6 June 1859 in Willis's Rooms at St James Street, where the Liberal Party was formed. The Queen asked [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]] to form a government, but although Palmerston agreed to serve under him, Russell did not. Therefore, on 12 June the Queen asked Palmerston to become prime minister. Russell and Gladstone agreed to serve under him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Victoria |title=The Letters of Queen Victoria: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog|year=1907|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog/page/n483 439]\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1859\u20131865==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Liberal government, 1859\u20131866}}\nHistorians usually regard Palmerston, starting in 1859, as the first Liberal.<ref>David Loades, ed., '' Readers Guide to British History'' (2003) 2: 998</ref> In his last premiership Palmerston oversaw the passage of important legislation.

The MP Sir [[William Henry Gregory|William Gregory]] was told by a member of the Cabinet that \"at the beginning of each session and after each holiday, Mr Gladstone used to come in charged to the muzzle with all sorts of schemes of all sorts of reforms which were absolutely necessary in his opinion to be immediately undertaken. Palmerston used to look fixedly at the paper before him, saying nothing until there was a lull in Gladstone's outpouring. He then rapped the table and said cheerfully: 'Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business'.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 563.</ref> Palmerston told Lord Shaftesbury: \"Gladstone will soon have it all his own way and whenever he gets my place we shall have strange doings\". He told another friend that he thought Gladstone would wreck the Liberal Party and end up in a madhouse.<ref>Ridley, p. 566.</ref>\n\nWhen in May 1864 the MP [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines]] introduced a Reform Bill in the Commons, Palmerston ordered Gladstone to not commit himself and the government to any particular scheme.<ref>Philip Guedalla (ed.), ''Gladstone and Palmerston, being the Correspondence of Lord Palmerston with Mr. Gladstone 1851\u20131865'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1928), p. 279.</ref> Instead Gladstone said in his speech in the Commons that he did not see why any man should not have the vote unless he was mentally incapacitated, but added that this would not come about unless the working class showed an interest in reform. Palmerston believed that this was incitement to the working class to begin agitating for reform and told Gladstone: \"What every Man and Woman too have a Right to, is to be well governed and under just Laws, and they who propose a change ought to shew that the present organization does not accomplish those objects\".<ref>Guedalla, p. 282.</ref>\n\n[[Second Italian War of Independence|French intervention in Italy]] had created an invasion scare and Palmerston established a [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] which reported in 1860. It recommended a huge [[Palmerston Forts|programme of fortifications]] to protect the [[Royal Navy Dockyards]] and ports, which Palmerston vigorously supported. Objecting to the enormous expense, Gladstone repeatedly threatened to resign as Chancellor when the proposals were accepted. Palmerston said that he had received so many resignation letters from Gladstone that he feared that they would set fire to the chimney.<ref>Ridley, p. 564.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Lord Lyons===\nDuring the advent and occurrence of the [[American Civil War]], the British Ambassador to the United States was Palmerston's close friend and ally [[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons, 2nd Baron Lyons]]. Palmerston had first appointed Richard Lyons to the Foreign Service in 1839, and was a close friend of his father, [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons]], with whom he had vehemently advocated increased aggression in the [[Crimean War]]. Palmerston and Lyons both had similar sociopolitical sympathies: both advocated monarchy and foreign interventionism. Throughout the American Civil War, Palmerston and Richard Lyons maintained an extensive confidential correspondence. Their actions were responsible for the peaceful resolution of the [[Trent Affair]]. When Lyons resigned from the position of American Ambassador, Palmerston attempted to persuade him to return, but Lyons declined the offer.<ref name=\"Jenkins Lyons\">{{cite book|title=Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War|author=Jenkins, Brian|publisher=McGill-Queen\u2019s Press, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\nPalmerston's sympathies in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) were with the secessionist [[Confederate States of America]]. Although a professed opponent of the slave trade and [[slavery]], he held a lifelong hostility towards the United States, and believed a dissolution of the Union would weaken America, thereby enhancing British power. Additionally, the Confederacy \"would afford a valuable and extensive market for British manufactures\".<ref>Ridley, p. 552.</ref><ref>Kevin Peraino, \"Lincoln vs. Palmerston\" in Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 120\u201369.</ref>\n\nBritain issued a [[s:British proclamation of neutrality in the American Civil War|proclamation of neutrality]] at the beginning of the Civil War on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognised as a [[belligerent]] but it was too premature to recognise it as a sovereign state. The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[William Seward]], threatened to treat as hostile any country which recognised the Confederacy. Britain depended more on American corn than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain's economic interest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Paterson|author2=J.

He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but 15 months later he felt: <blockquote>\"...the American War... has manifestly ceased to have any attainable object as far as the Northerns are concerned, except to get rid of some more thousand troublesome Irish and Germans. It must be owned, however, that the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides have shown courage and endurance highly honourable to their stock.\"<ref name=R559>Ridley, p. 559.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]] in November 1861 produced public outrage in Britain and a diplomatic crisis. A U.S. Navy warship stopped the British steamer ''Trent'' and seized two Confederate envoys ''en route'' to Europe.  Palmerston called the action \"a declared and gross insult\", demanded the release of the two diplomats and ordered 3,000 troops to Canada.  In a letter to Queen Victoria on 5 December 1861 he said that if his demands were not met: <blockquote>\"Great Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon be forgotten.\"<ref name=R554>Ridley, p. 554.</ref></blockquote> In another letter to his foreign secretary, he predicted war between Britain and the Union:\n<blockquote>\"It is difficult not to come to the conclusion that the rabid hatred of England which animates the exiled Irishmen who direct almost all the Northern newspapers, will so excite the masses as to make it impossible for Lincoln and Seward to grant our demands; and we must therefore look forward to war as the probable result.\"<ref name=R554/></blockquote>\nIn fact, Irishmen did not control any major newspapers in the North, and the U.S. decided to release the prisoners rather than risk war. Palmerston was convinced the presence of troops in Canada persuaded the U.S. to acquiesce.<ref>Kenneth Bourne, \"British Preparations for War with the North, 1861\u20131862,\" ''The English Historical Review'' Vol 76 No 301 (Oct 1961) pp 600\u2013632 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/558199 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAfter President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s announcement in September 1862 that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in ninety days, the cabinet debated intervention as a humanitarian move to stop a likely race war. At the same time however there was a cabinet crisis in France over the overthrow of the Greek king and the growing Eastern Question with regard to Russia. The British Government had to determine whether the situation in North America or the containment of Russia was more urgent. The decision was to give priority to threats closer to home and to decline France's suggestion of a joint intervention in America; the threatened race war over slavery never happened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eichhorn | first1 = Niels | year = 2014 | title = The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma? | url = | journal = American Nineteenth Century History | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 287\u2013310 }}</ref> Palmerston rejected all further efforts of the Confederacy to gain British recognition.<ref name=\"R559\"/>\n[[Image:Lord Palmerston 1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carte de visite]] depicting Lord Palmerston, 1863]]\n\nThe raiding ship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], built in the British port of [[Birkenhead]], was another difficulty for Palmerston. On 29 July 1862, a law officer's report he had commissioned advised him to detain ''Alabama'', as its construction was a breach of Britain's neutrality. Palmerston ordered ''Alabama'' detained on 31 July, but it had already put to sea before the order reached Birkenhead. In her subsequent cruise, ''Alabama'' captured or destroyed many Union merchant ships, as did other raiders fitted out in Britain.  The U.S. accused Britain of complicity in the construction of the raiders.  This was the basis of the postwar [[Alabama claims|''Alabama'' claims]] for damages against Britain, which Palmerston refused to pay.  After his death, Gladstone acknowledged the U.S. claim and agreed to arbitration, paying out $15,500,000 in damages.\n\nIn the autumn of 1862, Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, opened a cabinet debate on whether Britain should intervene. Gladstone had a favourable image of the Confederacy, and indeed of slavery (his family wealth depended on slavery in the [[British West Indies|West Indies]]). He emphasized the humanitarian intervention to stop the staggering death toll, risk of a race war, and failure of the Union to achieve decisive military results, but Prime Minister Palmerston had other concerns at the same time, including a crisis connected with the overthrow of the Greek king, which put the Eastern Question in play. The Cabinet decided that the American situation was less urgent than the need to contain Russian expansion,  so it rejected Gladstone's suggestions.<ref>Niels Eichhorn, \"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 15#3 (2014) pp 287\u2013310.</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nThe [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]] wanted to annex the Danish territory of [[Schleswig]] and the German territory of [[Holstein]], whose Duke was the King of Denmark, chiefly for its port of [[Kiel]], and had an alliance with Austria for this purpose. In a speech to the Commons on 23 July 1863, Palmerston said the British government, like those of France and Russia, wished that \"the independence, the integrity, and the rights of Denmark may be maintained. We are convinced\u2014I am convinced at least\u2014that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow those rights and interfere with that independence, those who made the attempt would find in the result that it would not be Denmark alone with which they would have to contend\".<ref>Ridley, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref> Palmerston's stance derived from the traditional belief that France was the greater threat to Britain and was much stronger than Austria and Prussia.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\">Ridley, p. 571.</ref>\n\nFor five months Bismarck did nothing. However, in November the Danish government instituted a new constitution whereby Holstein was bound closer to Denmark. Schleswig had already been a part of Denmark for centuries. By the year's end, the Prussian and Austrian armies were massing on the [[River Eider]]. On 1 February 1864 the Prussian-Austrian armies [[Second Schleswig War|invaded Schleswig-Holstein]], and ten days afterwards the Danish government requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his soldiers that were placed on the borders of Prussia's Rhineland provinces. Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\"/>\n\nIn April Austria's navy was on its way to attack Copenhagen, and Palmerston saw the Austrian ambassador and informed him that Britain could not allow their navy to sail through the English Channel if their intent was to attack Denmark, and if it entered the Baltic the result would be war with Britain. The ambassador replied that the Austrian navy would not enter the Baltic and it did not do so.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\">Ridley, p. 572.</ref>\n\nPalmerston accepted Russell's suggestion that the war should be settled at a conference, but at the ensuing [[London Conference of 1864]] in May and June the Danes refused to accept their loss of Schleswig-Holstein. The armistice ended on 26 June and Prussian-Austrian troops quickly invaded more of Denmark. On 25 June the Cabinet was against going to war to save Denmark, but Russell's suggestion to send the Royal Navy to defend Copenhagen was only carried by Palmerston's vote. Palmerston, however, said the fleet could not be sent in view of the deep division in the Cabinet.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\"/>\n\nOn 27 June Palmerston gave his statement to the Commons and said Britain would not go to war with the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or that Denmark's capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a vote of censure in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP [[Jonathan Peel|General Peel]] said: \"It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England{{sic}}, uttered in the Parliament of England{{sic}}, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers?\"  Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: \"I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who say she had fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided\".<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 573-74.</ref>\n\nThe vote of censure was defeated by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston's old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran up the stairs to the Ladies' Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: \"What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at three o'clock in the morning, and eighty years of age!\"<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 574.</ref>\n\nIn a speech at his constituency at [[Tiverton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tiverton]] in August, Palmerston told his constituents:\n\n<blockquote>I am sure every Englishman who has a heart in his breast and a feeling of justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword successfully in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which it was not possible to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture\u2014not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.<ref>\u2018Lord Palmerston At Tiverton\u2019, ''The Times'' (24 August 1864), p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEuropean leaders watched in confusion, unable to settle the matter by peaceful compromise. British diplomacy was in the same state.  His biographer William Baring Pemberton noticed: \"Palmerston's failure to understand Bismarck lies at the root of his misunderstanding of the Schleswig-Holstein question, and it derived from an old man's inability to adapt himself to a changing world\".<ref>William Baring Pemberton, ''Lord Palmerston'' (Batchworth Press, 1954)  p.332</ref>  Thus Britain was unable to stop Prussia and misunderstood Bismarck's ambitions. Russian historian Vinogradov V. N. writes: \"In place of the former insight came bias in judgments and stubbornness in defending outdated views. Palmerston continued to consider Prussia as \"instrument in the hands of Austria\", its army - weak and doomed to defeat, and its public - consisting of romantically minded students and dreamy professors. And Otto von Bismarck quietly annexed to the Prussia two Duchies, and at the same time the County of Lauenburg\".<ref>Vinogradov V.N. Lord Parmerston in European diplomacy. New and recent history. 2006. N5. In Russian.</ref> Britain actually approved the first step to the emergence of the Reich, to the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|\"blood and iron\"]].\n\n===Electoral victory===\nPalmerston won another [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election in July 1865]], increasing his majority.  The leadership of Palmerston was a great electoral asset to the Liberal Party.<ref>Ridley, p. 579.</ref> He then had to deal with the outbreak of [[Fenian]] violence in Ireland. Palmerston ordered the [[Viceroy of Ireland]], [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Wodehouse]], to take measures against this, including a possible suspension of trial-by-jury and a monitoring of Americans travelling to Ireland. He believed that the [[Fenian]] agitation was caused by America. On 27 September 1865 he wrote to the Secretary for War:\n<blockquote>The American assault on Ireland under the name of Fenianism may be now held to have failed, but the snake is only scotched and not killed. It is far from impossible that the American conspirators may try and obtain in our North American provinces compensation for their defeat in Ireland.<ref>Ridley, p. 581.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe advised that more armaments be sent to Canada and more troops be sent to Ireland. During these last few weeks of his life, Palmerston pondered on developments in foreign affairs. He began thinking of a new friendship with France as \"a sort of preliminary defensive alliance\" against America and looked forward to Prussia becoming more powerful as this would balance against the growing threat from Russia.  In a letter to Russell he warned that Russia \"will in due time become a power almost as great as the old Roman Empire&nbsp;... Germany ought to be strong in order to resist Russian aggression.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 582.</ref> Palmerston's successors had a very different task-to restrain an aggressive Germany.\n\n==Death==\nPalmerston enjoyed robust health in old age,<ref>Hibbert, Christopher ''Disraeli: A Personal History'' (2004) p. 256</ref> living at [[Romsey]] in his home Foxhills, built in about 1840. On 12 October 1865 he caught a chill, and instead of retiring immediately to bed he spent an hour and a half [[Death during consensual sex#Notable cases|dawdling]]. He then had a violent fever but his condition stabilised for the next few days. However, on the night of 17 October his health worsened, and when his doctor asked him if he believed in regeneration of the world through Jesus Christ, Palmerston replied: \"Oh, surely.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\">Ridley, p. 583.</ref> His last words were, \"That's Article 98; now go on to the next.\" (He was thinking about diplomatic treaties.)<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\"/> An apocryphal version of his last words is: \"Die, my dear doctor? That is the last thing I shall do.\" He died at 10:45 am on Wednesday, 18 October 1865 two days before his eighty-first birthday. Although Palmerston wanted to be buried at [[Romsey Abbey]], the Cabinet insisted that he should have a [[state funeral]] and be buried at [[Westminster Abbey]], which he was, on 27 October 1865. He was the fourth person not of royalty to be granted a state funeral (after [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]).\n\nQueen Victoria wrote after his death that though she regretted his passing, she had never liked or respected him: \"Strange, and solemn to think of that strong, determined man, with so much worldly ambition \u2013 gone! He had often worried and distressed us, though as Pr. Minister he had behaved ''very well''.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\">Ridley, p. 584.</ref> [[Florence Nightingale]] reacted differently upon hearing of his death: \"He will be a great loss to us. Tho' he made a joke when asked to do the right thing, he always did it. No one else will be able to carry things thro' the Cabinet as he did. I shall lose a powerful protector...He was so much more in earnest than he appeared. He did not do himself justice.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\"/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his stepson [[William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple|William Cowper-Temple]] (later created [[Baron Mount Temple|The 1st Baron Mount Temple]]), whose inheritance included a 10,000-acre estate in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]], on which his stepfather had commissioned the building of the incomplete [[Classiebawn Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sligoheritage.com/archirishvillage.htm|title= Profile of an Irish Village-Palmerston and the Conquest, Colonisation and Evolution of Mullaghmore, Co. Sligo|accessdate = 26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Algernon Cecil, summed up his greatness:\n: Palmerston placed his trust... in the Press which he was at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper he knew how to catch and the weight of his name and resources he brought to bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effontry that has never been excelled.<ref>Algernon Cecil, ''British Foreign Secretaries, 1807\u20131916'' (1927) p 139</ref>\n\nPalmerston has traditionally been viewed as \"a Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad\".<ref>Ridley, p. 587.</ref> He believed that the British constitution as secured by the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 was the best which human hands had made, with a constitutional monarchy subject to the laws of the land but retaining some political power. He supported the rule of law and opposed further democratisation after the [[Reform Act 1832]]. He wished to see this liberal system of a mixed constitution in-between the two extremes of absolute monarchy and republican democracy replace the absolute monarchies on the Continent.<ref>Ridley, p. 588.</ref> More recently some historians have seen his domestic policies as Prime Minister as not merely liberal but genuinely progressive by the standards of his era.<ref>David Steele, ''Palmerston and Liberalism, 1855\u20131865'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991).</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Capture of the King of Delhi by Captain Hodson\".jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Palmerston agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown.]]\nHowever, it is in foreign affairs that Palmerston is chiefly remembered. Palmerston's principal aim in foreign policy was to advance the national interests of England.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\"/> Palmerston is famous for his patriotism. [[Lord John Russell]] said that \"his heart always beat for the honour of England\".<ref>''The Times'' (10 November 1865), p. 7.</ref> Palmerston believed it was in Britain's interests that liberal governments be established on the Continent. He also practised brinkmanship and bluff in that he was prepared to threaten war to achieve Britain's interests.<ref>Ridely, p. 589.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's foreign policy achievements were very short-term. The peace conditions of the Congress of Paris collapsed with the defeat of France in the war with Prussia in 1870-71. The European balance was upset with the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia in 1871.\n\nWhen in 1886 [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] became Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's government, [[John Bright]] asked him if he had read about Palmerston's policies as Foreign Secretary. Rosebery replied that he had. \"Then\", said Bright, \"you know what to avoid. Do the exact opposite of what he did. His administration at the Foreign Office was one long crime.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 591.</ref> The [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]] said of Palmerston in 1866: \"He loved his country and his country loved him. He lived for her honour, and she will cherish his memory.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Edinburgh Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miQ4AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA275|year=1866|page=275}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Gladstone recounted a story of when \"a Frenchman, thinking to be highly complimentary, said to Palmerston: 'If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman'; to which Pam coolly replied: 'If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\">Ridley, p. 589.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] campaigned for rearmament in the 1930s, he was compared to Palmerston in warning the nation to look to its defences.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Winston Churchill. The Wilderness Years'' (London: Book Club Associates, 1981), pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> The policy of [[appeasement]] led General [[Jan Smuts]] to write in 1936 that \"we are afraid of our shadows. I sometimes long for a ruffian like Palmerston or any man who would be more than a string of platitudes and apologies.\"<ref>W. K. Hancock, ''Smuts. Volume II: The Fields of Force. 1919\u20131950'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 281.</ref>\n\nHe was also an avowed [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] whose attempts to abolish the slave trade was one of the most consistent elements of his foreign policy. His opposition to the slave trade created tensions with South American countries and the United States over his insistence that the [[Royal Navy]] had the right to search the vessels of any country if they suspected the vessels were being used in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].\n\nHistorian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] has summarised his career by emphasising the paradoxes:\n:For twenty years junior minister in a Tory government, he became the most successful of Whig Foreign Secretaries; though always a Conservative, he ended his life by presiding over the transition from Whiggism to Liberalism. He was the exponent of British strength, yet was driven from office for truckling to a foreign despot; he preached the Balance of Power, yet helped to inaugurate the policy of isolation and of British withdrawal from Europe. Irresponsible and flippant, he became the first hero of the serious middle-class electorate. He reached high office solely through an irregular family connection; he retained it through skilful use of the press\u2014the only Prime Minister to become an accomplished leader-writer.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, \"Lord Palmerston,\" ''History Today'' Jan 1991, Vol. 41#1 p 1</ref>\n\nPalmerston is also remembered for his light-hearted approach to government. He is once said to have claimed of a particularly intractable problem relating to [[Schleswig-Holstein question|Schleswig-Holstein]], that only three people had ever understood the problem: one was [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], who was dead; the second was a German professor, who had gone insane; and the third was himself, who had forgotten it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Douglas|last1=Hurd|author1-link=Douglas Hurd|title=Choose Your Weapons: The British Foreign Secretary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpBc5JZsd5gC&pg=RA1-PR33#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-85851-5|page=33}}</ref>\n\n''The Life of Lord Palmerston up to 1847'' was written by Lord Dalling ([[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Sir H.

The whole work was reissued in a revised and slightly abridged form by Ashley in 2 volumes in 1879, with the title ''The Life and Correspondence of Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston''; the letters are judiciously curtailed, but unfortunately without indicating where the excisions occur; the appendices of the original work are omitted, but much fresh matter is added, and this edition is undoubtedly the standard biography.<ref>Stanley Lane-Poole, '[[s:Temple, Henry John (DNB00)|Temple, Henry John]]', ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885\u20131900, Volume 56''.</ref>\n\n===Places named===\n[[File:Palmerston - geograph.org.uk - 259077.jpg|thumb|right|Palmerston's Memorial in Southampton]]\n*The Town of [[Palmerston, Ontario|Palmerston]] located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada was founded and named after Lord Palmerston in 1875.

{{postnominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=100%|KG|GCB|PC|FRS}} (20 October 1784 \u2013 18 October 1865) was a [[British people|British]] statesman who served twice as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the mid-19th century. Palmerston dominated British foreign policy during the period 1830 to 1865, when Britain was at the height of its imperial power. He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865. He began his parliamentary career as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]], defected to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in 1830, and became the first Prime Minister of the newly formed [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1859.\n\nPalmerston succeeded to his father's [[Irish peerage]] in 1802. He became a Tory MP in 1807 (his Irish peerage did not bar him from a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], because it did not entitle him to a seat in the [[House of Lords]]). From 1809 to 1828 he served as [[Secretary at War]], in which post he was responsible for the organisation of the finances of the army. He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827, when [[George Canning]] became Prime Minister, but, like other [[Canningites]], he resigned from office one year later.\n\nHe served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] 1830\u201334,  1835\u201341, and 1846\u201351. In this office, Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe. His belligerent actions as Foreign Secretary, some of which were highly controversial, have been considered to be prototypes of the practice of [[Interventionism (politics)|liberal interventionism]].\n\nPalmerston became [[Home Secretary]] in [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]]'s coalition government, in 1852, subsequent to the [[Peelite]] advocacy of the appointment of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] to the office of Foreign Secretary. As Home Secretary, Palmerston enacted various social reforms, although he opposed electoral reform. When public antipathy over the Government's policy in the [[Crimean War]] lost the Government popular favour, in 1855, Palmerston was the only Prime Minister who was able to sustain a majority in Parliament.  He had two periods in office, 1855\u20131858 and 1859\u20131865, before his death at the age of 80 years, a few months after victory in a [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in which he had achieved an increased majority. He remains, to date, the last Prime Minister to die in office.\n\nPalmerston masterfully controlled public opinion by stimulating [[British nationalism]], and, despite the fact that [[Queen Victoria]] and most of the political leadership distrusted him, he received and sustained the favour of the press and the populace, from whom he received the affectionate sobriquet 'Pam'. Palmerston's alleged weaknesses included mishandling of personal relations, and continual disagreements with the Queen over the royal role in determining foreign policy.<ref>Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Nineteenth Century 1814\u201380'' (1975) p 108</ref>\n\nHistorians consider Palmerston to be one of the greatest foreign secretaries, as a consequence of his handling of great crises, his commitment to the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]], which provided Britain with decisive agency in many conflicts, his analytic skills, and his commitment to British interests. His policies in relation to [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] had extensive long-lasting beneficial consequences for Britain: although the consequences of his policies toward [[France]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[United States]] were more ephemeral.\n\n==Early life: 1784\u20131806==\n[[Image:Palmerston 1802.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 18) in 1802, by [[Thomas Heaphy]]]]\nHenry John Temple was born in his family's [[Westminster]] house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd [[Viscount Palmerston]] upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the [[Peerage of Ireland]], although the 3rd [[Viscount]] would almost never visit [[Ireland]]. His father was [[Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston|The 2nd Viscount Palmerston]] (1739\u20131802), an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer, and his mother was Mary (1752\u20131805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant.<ref>Edward J. Davies, \"The Ancestry of Lord Palmerston\", ''The Genealogist'', 22(2008):62\u201377.</ref> From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour.

[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Augustus Clifford|Sir Augustus Clifford]], 1st [[Baronet|Bt.]], was a [[fagging|fag]] to Palmerston, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]] and [[John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough|Viscount Duncannon]] and later remembered Palmerston as by far the most merciful of the three.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 10\">Ridley, p. 10.</ref> Palmerston was often engaged in school fights and fellow Old Harrovians remembered Palmerston as someone who stood up to bullies twice his size.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 10\"/> Palmerston's father took him to the House of Commons in 1799, where young Palmerston shook hands with the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]].<ref>Ridley, p. 12.</ref>\n\nPalmerston was then at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1800\u20131803), where he learnt political economy from [[Dugald Stewart]], a friend of the Scottish philosophers [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[Adam Smith]].<ref>Ridley, p. 14.</ref> Palmerston later described his time at Edinburgh as producing \"whatever useful knowledge and habits of mind I possess\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">David Steele, \u2018[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27112 Temple,  Henry John, third Viscount Palmerston  (1784\u20131865)]\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press,  2004; online edn, May 2009, accessed 11 December 2010.</ref> [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]] wrote to Palmerston's parents that young Palmerston was well-mannered and charming. Stewart wrote to a friend, saying of Palmerston: \"In point of temper and conduct he is everything his friends could wish. Indeed, I cannot say that I have ever seen a more faultless character at this time of life, or one possessed of more amiable dispositions.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 15.</ref>\n\nPalmerston succeeded his father to the title of [[Viscount Palmerston]] on 17 April 1802, before he had turned 18. The young 3rd Lord Palmerston also inherited a vast [[country estate]] in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]]. He later built [[Classiebawn Castle]] on this estate. Palmerston went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] (1803\u20131806).<ref>{{acad|id=PLMN803HJ|name=Palmerston, Henry John (Temple), Viscount}}</ref> As a nobleman, he was entitled to take his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] without examinations, but Palmerston wished to obtain his degree through examinations. This was declined, although he was allowed to take the separate College examinations, where he obtained first-class honours.<ref>Ridley, p. 18.</ref>\n\nAfter war was declared on France in 1803, Palmerston joined the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803\u20131805|Volunteers]] mustered to oppose a [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|French invasion]], being one of the three officers in the unit for St John's College. He was also appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commander of the Romsey Volunteers.<ref>Ridley, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n==Early political career: 1806\u20131809==\n[[File:Shield of arms of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, KG, GCB, PC, FRS.png|thumb|upright|Shield of arms of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel.]]\nIn February 1806 Palmerston was defeated in the election for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge constituency]].<ref>Ridley, pp. 19\u201322.</ref> In [[1806 United Kingdom general election|November]] he was elected for [[Horsham (UK Parliament constituency)|Horsham]] but was unseated in January 1807, when the Whig majority in the Commons voted for a petition to unseat him.<ref>Ridley, pp. 24\u201326.</ref>\n\nDue to the patronage of [[Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester|Lord Chichester]] and [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]], he was given the post of Junior Lord of the [[Admiralty]] in the ministry of the [[William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]].<ref>Ridley, p. 27.</ref> Palmerston stood again for the Cambridge seat in [[1807 United Kingdom general election|May]] but he lost by three votes after he advised his supporters to vote for the other Tory candidate in the two-member constituency so as to ensure a Tory was elected.<ref>Ridley, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nPalmerston entered Parliament as Tory MP for the [[pocket borough]] of [[Newport (Isle of Wight) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]] on the Isle of Wight in June 1807.<ref name=\"note\">Although peers of [[Peerage of England|England]], [[Peerage of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Peerage of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] sat in the House of Lords and were not able to sit as Members of Parliament in the House of Commons, the Viscountcy of Palmerston was in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] which did not automatically grant the right to sit in the Lords. Palmerston was thus able to serve as an MP.</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1808 Palmerston spoke in support of confidentiality in the working of diplomacy and the bombardment of Copenhagen and the capture and destruction of the Danish navy by the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: a biography'' (2011) p 57.</ref>  Denmark was neutral but [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] had recently agreed with the Russians in the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] to build a naval alliance against Britain, including using the Danish navy for invading Britain.<ref>Ridley, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> Pre-empting this, the British offered Denmark the choice of temporarily handing over its navy until the war's end or the destruction of their navy. The Danes refused to comply and so Copenhagen was bombarded. Palmerston justified the attack by peroration with reference to the ambitions of Napoleon to take control of the Danish fleet:\n\n<blockquote>it is defensible on the ground that the enormous power of France enables her to coerce the weaker state to become an enemy of England...It is the law of self-preservation that England appeals for the justification of her proceedings. It is admitted by the honourable gentleman and his supporters, that if Denmark had evidenced any hostility towards this country, then we should have been justified in measures of retaliation...Denmark coerced into hostility stands in the same position as Denmark voluntarily hostile, when the law of self-preservation comes into play...Does anyone believe that Buonaparte will be restrained by any considerations of justice from acting towards Denmark as he has done towards other countries?...England, according to that law of self-preservation which is a fundamental principle of the law of nations, is justified in securing, and therefore enforcing, from Denmark a neutrality which France would by compulsion have converted into an active hostility.<ref>George Henry Francis, ''Opinions and Policy of the Right Honourable Viscount Palmerston, G.C.B., M.P., &c. as Minister, Diplomatist, and Statesman, During More Than Forty Years of Public Life'' (1852), pp. 1\u20133.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a letter to a friend on 24 December 1807, Palmerston described the late Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] as possessing \"the palm of political prophecy\".<ref>Kenneth Bourne (ed.), ''The Letters of the Third Viscount Palmerston to Laurence and Elizabeth Sulivan. 1804\u20131863'' (London: The Royal Historical Society, 1979), p. 97.</ref> This would become a metaphor for his own career in divining the course of imperial foreign policy.\n\n==Secretary at War: 1809\u20131828==\n[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|The [[British Empire]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815]]\nPalmerston's speech was so successful that [[Spencer Perceval]], who formed his government in 1809, asked him to become [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], then a less important office than it was to become from the mid nineteenth century. Palmerston preferred the office of [[Secretary at War]], charged exclusively with the financial business of the army. Without a seat in the cabinet until 1827, he remained in the latter post for 20 years.<ref>Dick Leonard, ''Nineteenth Century British Premieres: Pitt to Roseberry'' (2008) pp 249\u201351</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 1818 a retired officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, who had a grievance about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as he walked up the stairs of the War Office. The bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies was mad, he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]).<ref>Ridley, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nAfter the suicide of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] in 1822, the Cabinet of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s Tory administration began to split along political lines. The more liberal wing of the Tory government made some ground, with [[George Canning]] becoming [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Huskisson]] advocating and applying the doctrines of free trade, and [[Catholic emancipation]] emerging as an open question. Although Palmerston was not in the Cabinet, he cordially supported the measures of Canning and his friends.\n\nUpon the retirement of Lord Liverpool in April 1827, Canning was called to be Prime Minister. The more conservative Tories, including [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], withdrew their support, and an alliance was formed between the liberal members of the late ministry and the Whigs. The post of Chancellor of the Exchequer was offered to Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was frustrated by some intrigue between the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[John Charles Herries]]. Palmerston remained Secretary at War, though he gained a seat in the cabinet for the first time. The Canning administration ended after only four months on the death of the Prime Minister, and was followed by the ministry of [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]], which barely survived the year.\n\nThe [[Canningites]] remained influential, and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] hastened to include Palmerston, Huskisson, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Charles Grant]], [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]], and [[John William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|The Earl of Dudley]] in the government he subsequently formed. However, a dispute between Wellington and Huskisson over the issue of parliamentary representation for Manchester and Birmingham led to the resignation of Huskisson and his allies, including Palmerston. In the spring of 1828, after more than twenty years continuously in office, Palmerston found himself in opposition.\n\nOn 26 February 1828 Palmerston delivered a speech in favour of Catholic Emancipation.  He felt that it was unseemly to relieve the \"imaginary grievances\" of the Dissenters from the established church while at the same time \"real afflictions pressed upon the Catholics\" of Great Britain.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1828/feb/26/repeal-of-the-test-and-corporation-acts REPEAL OF THE TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.

He had already urged Wellington into active interference in the [[Greek War of Independence]], and he had made several visits to [[Paris]], where he foresaw with great accuracy the impending overthrow of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons]]. On 1 June 1829 he made his first great speech on foreign affairs.\n{{Quote\n|text=Lord Palmerston was no orator; his language was unstudied, and his delivery somewhat embarrassed; but generally he found the words to say the right thing at the right time, and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience.\n|title=\"Lord Palmerston\" |source=\"Encyclopaedia Britannica 13th Edition\"\n}} \nAn attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] and [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.<ref>Ridley, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1830\u20131841==\nPalmerston entered the office with great energy and continued to exert his influence there for twenty years; he held it from 1830 to 1834 \u2013 his apprentice years<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 70-1</ref> - 1835 to 1841, and 1846 to 1851. Basically, Palmerston was responsible for the whole of British foreign policy from the time of the French and Belgian Revolutions of 1830 until December 1851.  His abrasive style would earn him the nickname \"Lord Pumice Stone\", and his manner of dealing with foreign governments who crossed him, especially in his later years,<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 232</ref> was the original  \"[[gunboat diplomacy]]\".<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 143-88.</ref>\n\n===Crises of 1830===\nThe [[revolutions of 1830]] gave a jolt to the settled European system that had been created in 1814\u201315.

Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 149-54.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's overall policy was to safeguard British interests, maintain peace, keep the balance of power, and retain the status quo in Europe. He had no grievance against Russia and while he privately sympathized with the Polish cause, in his role as foreign minister he rejected Polish demands. With serious trouble simultaneously taking place in Belgium and Italy, and lesser issues in Greece and Portugal, he sought to de-escalate European tensions rather than aggravate them, favouring a policy of universal non-interventionism.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 72</ref>  He therefore focused chiefly on achieving a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Belgium.<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp. 148\u201354.</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n[[William I of the Netherlands]] appealed to the great powers that had placed him on the throne after the Napoleonic Wars to maintain his rights. The [[London Conference of 1830]] was called to address this question. The British solution involved the independence of Belgium, which Palmerston believed would greatly contribute to the security of Britain, but any solution was not straightforward. On the one hand, the northern powers were anxious to defend William I; on the other, many Belgian revolutionaries, like [[Charles de Brouck\u00e8re]] and [[Charles Rogier]], supported the reunion of the Belgian provinces to France, whereas Britain favoured Dutch, not French influence, on an independent state.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 20</ref>\n\nThe British policy which emerged was a close alliance with France,<ref name=\"E Halevy, 1961 p. 73\">E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 73</ref>  but one subject to the balance of power on the Continent, and in particular the preservation of Belgium independence. If the northern powers supported William I by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and Britain united in arms. If France sought to annex Belgium, it would forfeit the British alliance and find herself opposed by the whole of Europe. In the end the British policy prevailed.<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 233</ref> Although the continent had been close to war, peace was maintained on London's terms and Prince [[L\u00e9opold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg]], the widower of a British princess, was placed upon the throne of Belgium.

Their positions were under some pressure from their absolutist kinsmen, Dom [[Miguel of Portugal]] and [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]] of Spain, who were the closest males in the lines of succession. Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a quadruple alliance of the constitutional states of the West to serve as a counterpoise to the northern alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on 22 April 1834 and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain, it accomplished its objective.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 153-72.</ref>\n\nFrance had been a reluctant party to the treaty, and never executed its role in it with much zeal. [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] was accused of secretly favouring the [[Carlism|Carlists]] \u2013 the supporters of Don Carlos \u2013 and he rejected direct interference in Spain. It is probable that the hesitation of the French court on this question was one of the causes of the enduring personal hostility Palmerston showed towards the French King thereafter, though that sentiment may well have arisen earlier. Although Palmerston wrote in June 1834 that Paris was \"the pivot of my foreign policy\", the differences between the two countries grew into a constant but sterile rivalry that brought benefit to neither.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Lytton Bulwer|title=The Life of Henry John Temple Viscount Palmerston: With Selections from His Diaries and Correspondence|publisher=Richard Bentley|url=https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog|year=1871|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog/page/n174 170]}}</ref>\n\n===Balkans and Near East: defending Turkey, 1830s===\nPalmerston was greatly interested by the diplomatic questions of Eastern Europe. During the [[Greek War of Independence]] he had energetically supported the Greek cause and backed the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] that gave Greece its independence. However, from 1830 the defence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] became one of the cardinal objects of his policy. He believed in the regeneration of Turkey, as he wrote to Bulwer (Lord Dalling): \"All that we hear about the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure unadulterated nonsense.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SpLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA647|year=1911|page=647}}</ref>\n\nHis two great aims were to prevent Russia establishing itself on the [[Bosporus]] and to prevent France doing likewise on the Nile. He regarded the maintenance of the authority of the [[Sublime Porte]] as the chief barrier against both these developments.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Image:3rd Viscount Palmerston young.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 50s), c. 1830s\u20131840s.]]\nPalmerston had long maintained a suspicious and hostile attitude towards Russia, whose autocratic government offended his liberal principles and whose ever-growing size challenged the strength of the British Empire. He was angered by the 1833 [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]], a mutual assistance pact between Russia and the Ottomans, but was annoyed and hostile towards [[David Urquhart]], the creator of the [[Mission of the Vixen|Vixen affair]], running the Russian blockade of [[Circassia]] in the mid-1830s.<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 210-11.</ref> \n\nFor his part, David Urquhart considered Palmerston a \"mercenary of Russia\" and founded the \"Free Press\" magazine in London, where he constantly promoted these views. The permanent author of this magazine was Karl Marx, who stated \"from the time of Peter the Great until the Crimean war, there was a secret agreement between the London and St. Petersburg offices, and that Palmerston was a corrupt tool the Tsar policy\" <ref>Franz Mering. \"Karl Marx.

Palmerston held that \"if we can procure for it ten years of peace under the joint protection of the five Powers, and if those years are profitably employed in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, there is no reason whatever why it should not become again a respectable Power\" and challenged the metaphor that an old country, such as Turkey should be in such disrepair as would be warranted by the comparison: \"Half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Evelyn M.

However, by 1840 Muhammad Ali had occupied [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and won the [[Battle of Nezib]] against the Turkish forces. [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Lord Ponsonby]], the British ambassador at Constantinople, vehemently urged the British government to intervene. Having closer ties to the pasha than most, France refused to be a party to coercive measures against him despite having signed the note in the previous year.<ref>Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 191-98.</ref>\n\nPalmerston, irritated at France's Egyptian policy, signed the [[Convention of London (1840)|London Convention]] of 15 July 1840 in London with [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] \u2013 without the knowledge of the French government.  This measure was taken with great hesitation, and strong opposition on the part of several members of the cabinet.  Palmerston forced the measure through in part by declaring in a letter to the Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], that he would resign from the ministry if his policy were not adopted.\nThe London Convention granted Muhammad Ali hereditary rule in Egypt in return for withdrawal from Syria and Lebanon, but was rejected by the pasha.  The European powers intervened with force, and the bombardment of [[Beirut]], the fall of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and the total collapse of Muhammad Ali's power followed in rapid succession.  Palmerston's policy was triumphant, and the author of it had won a reputation as one of the most powerful statesmen of the age.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston,'' pp. 248\u201360</ref>\n\nIn September 1838, Palmerston appointed a British consul in Jerusalem, without the conventional consultation of the Board of Trade, and gave instruction to assist with the construction of an Anglican church in the city, under the prompting influences of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], a prominent [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionist]].<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year=2014 | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref>\n\n===China: First Opium War===\n{{See also|Destruction of opium at Humen}}\n[[File:Canton from the Heights.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|British bombardment of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] from the surrounding heights, May 1841]]\n\nChina restricted trade under the [[Canton System]] (a similar policy to the policies of various European countries<ref>{{cite book |last1=Peer Vries |title=State, Economy and the Great Divergence: Great Britain and China, 1680s-1850s |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1472526403 |pages=353\u2013354}}</ref> ) and permitted official diplomatic relations only to tributary countries. Palmerston saw this as an affront to his free trade principles, and demanded reform, sending [[William Napier, 9th Lord Napier|Lord Napier]] to negotiate in 1834. China refused, and interdicted the British smugglers bringing in [[History of opium in China|opium]] from India, which was banned in China. The upshot was the [[First Opium War]], 1839\u201342, which ended in the conquest of [[Zhoushan|Chusan]] by [[Henry Pottinger]]. It was later exchanged for the island of [[Hong Kong]]. Under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]], China paid an indemnity and opened five [[treaty ports]] to world trade.

This made him very popular among the ordinary people of Britain, but his passion, propensity to act through personal animosity, and imperious language made him seem dangerous and destabilising in the eyes of the queen and his more conservative colleagues in government.  Meanwhile he manipulated information and public opinion to enhance his control of his department, including controlling communications within the office and to other officials. He leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control and more publicity, all the while stirring up British nationalism.<ref>John K.

The crisis was past, but the change which took place by the substitution of [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] for [[Adolphe Thiers]] in France, and of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] for Palmerston in Britain was a fortunate event for the peace of the world. Palmerston had adopted the opinion that peace with France was not to be relied on, and indeed that war between the two countries was sooner or later inevitable. Aberdeen and Guizot inaugurated a different policy: by mutual confidence and friendly offices, they entirely succeeded in restoring the most cordial understanding between the two governments, and the irritation which Palmerston had inflamed gradually subsided. During the administration of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], Palmerston led a retired life, but he attacked with characteristic bitterness the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with the United States. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 resolved several Canadian boundary disputes with the United States, particularly the border between [[New Brunswick]] and the State of [[Maine]] and between Canada and the State of [[Minnesota]] from Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. Much as he criticised it, the treaty successfully closed the border questions with which Palmerston had long been concerned.<ref>Robert Remini, ''Daniel Webster'' (W. W. Norton and Co.: New York, 1997) pp. 538\u2013565.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's reputation as an interventionist and his unpopularity with the Queen and other grandees was such that [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] attempt in December 1845 to form a ministry failed because [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] refused to join a government in which Palmerston would direct foreign affairs. A few months later, however, the Whigs returned to power and Palmerston to the Foreign Office (July 1846). Russell replied to critics that Palmerston's policies had \"a ''tendency'' to produce war\" but that he had advanced British interests without a major conflict, if not entirely peaceably.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1846\u20131851==\nPalmerston's years as foreign secretary, 1846-1851, involve dealing with violent upheavals all over Europe \u2013 he has been dubbed \"the gunpowder minister\" by biographer David Brown.<ref>David Brown., ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 279\u2013333.</ref>\n\n===France and Spain, 1845===\n{{Main|Affair of the Spanish Marriages}}\n[[Image:Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Palmerston, c. 1845]]\nThe French government regarded the appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities. They availed themselves of a dispatch in which he had put forward the name of a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain as a justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. However little the conduct of the French government in this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is certain that it originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] and the other powers of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small loss of honourable reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ewing Ritchie|title=The life and times of viscount Palmerston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kABAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA648|year=1866|page=648}}</ref>\n\nHistorian David Brown rejects the traditional interpretation to the effect that Aberdeen had forged an entente cordiale with France in the early 1840s whereupon the belligerent Palmerston after 1846 destroyed that friendly relationship.

Palmerston sympathised openly with the revolutionary party abroad. In particular, he was a strong advocate of [[national self-determination]], and stood firmly on the side of constitutional liberties on the Continent. Despite this, he was bitterly opposed to [[Irish nationalism|Irish independence]], and deeply hostile to the [[Young Ireland]] movement.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 241-49.</ref>\n\n===Italian independence===\nNo state was regarded by him with more aversion than [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Yet, his opposition to Austria was chiefly based upon its occupation of northeastern Italy and [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|its Italian policy]]. Palmerston maintained that the existence of Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in the political views of Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been passionately awakened by the cause of [[Italian unification|Italian independence]]. He supported the Sicilians against the [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King]] of [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Naples]], and even allowed arms to be sent them from the arsenal at Woolwich. Although he had endeavoured to restrain the [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|King]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] from his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an envoy to London to request the mediation of Britain, based on a large cession of Italian territory. Palmerston rejected the terms he might have obtained for Piedmont. After a couple of years this wave of revolution was replaced by a wave of reaction.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 343-48.</ref><ref>Herbert C. F. Bell, ''Lord Palmerston - Vol. 1'' (1936) pp 422-48.</ref>\n\n===Hungarian independence===\nIn [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526-1867)|Hungary]] the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848 war for independence]] from the [[Austrian Empire]], ruled by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]], was defeated by the joint army of Austrian and Russian forces. [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] assumed the government of the empire with dictatorial power. In spite of what Palmerston termed his judicious bottle-holding, the movement he had encouraged and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere subdued. The British government, or at least Palmerston as its representative, was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the French republic.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 355.</ref> Even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by Palmerston's attack on Greece. When [[Lajos Kossuth]], the Hungarian democrat and leader of its constitutionalists, landed in England in 1851 to wide applause, Palmerston proposed to receive him at Broadlands, a design which was only prevented by a peremptory vote of the cabinet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Laurence Fenton|title=Palmerston and the Times: Foreign Policy, the Press and Public Opinion in Mid-Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbXpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119|year=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=119\u201320|isbn=9780857736512}}</ref>\n\n===Royal and parliamentary reaction to 1848===\nThis state of things was regarded with the utmost annoyance by the British court and by most of the British ministers. On many occasions, Palmerston had taken important steps without their knowledge, which they disapproved.  Over the [[Foreign Office]] he asserted and exercised an arbitrary dominion, which the feeble efforts of the premier could not control. The Queen and the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] did not conceal their indignation at the fact that they were held responsible for Palmerston's actions by the other Courts of Europe.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 333-58.</ref>\n\nWhen Disraeli attacked Palmerston's foreign policy, the foreign minister responded to a five-hour speech by [[Thomas Chisholm Anstey|Anstey]] with a five-hour speech of his own, the first of two great speeches in which he laid out a comprehensive defence of his foreign policy and of liberal interventionism more generally. Arguing for domestic political effect, Palmerston declaimed:\n:I hold that the real policy of England... is to be the champion of justice and right, pursuing that course with moderation and prudence, not becoming the [[Don Quixote (character)|Quixote]] of the world, but giving the weight of her moral sanction and support wherever she thinks that justice is, and whenever she thinks that wrong has been done.<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd Hilton|title=A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783-1846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDFHmqU_6SEC&pg=PR248|year=2006|page=247|isbn=9780191606823}}</ref>\n\nRussell and the Queen both hoped that the other would take the initiative and dismiss Palmerston; the Queen was dissuaded by her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who took the limits of constitutional power very seriously, and Russell by Palmerston's prestige with the people and his competence in an otherwise remarkably inept Cabinet.\n\n===Don Pacifico Affair===\n{{main|Don Pacifico Affair}}\nIn 1847 the home of [[Don Pacifico]], a Gibraltarian merchant living in Athens, Greece, was attacked by an anti-Semitic mob which included the sons of a Greek government minister. The Greek police did not intervene in the attack, despite being present.<ref>Ridley, pp. 374\u2013375.</ref> Because Don Pacifico was a British subject, the British government expressed concern. In January 1850, Palmerston took advantage of Don Pacifico's claims on the Greek government, and blockaded the port of Piraeus in the kingdom of Greece. As Greece was under the joint protection of three powers, Russia and France protested against its coercion by the British fleet.<ref>Ridley, pp. 379\u201381.</ref><ref>Geoffrey Hicks, \"Don Pacifico, Democracy, and Danger: The Protectionist Party Critique of British Foreign Policy, 1850\u20131852.\" ''International History Review'' 26.3 (2004): 515\u2013540.

The House of Commons was moved by [[John Arthur Roebuck|Roebuck]] to reverse the rebuke, which it did on 29 June by a majority of 46, after having heard from Palmerston on 25 June. This was the most eloquent and powerful speech he ever delivered, wherein he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs.\n{{wikisource|Don Pacifico Speech}}\nIt was in this speech, which lasted for five hours, that Palmerston made the well known declaration that a British subject ought everywhere to be protected by the strong arm of the British government against injustice and wrong; comparing the reach of the British Empire to that of the Roman Empire, in which a Roman citizen could walk the earth unmolested by any foreign power. This was the famous ''[[Civis Romanus sum]]'' (\"I am a citizen of Rome\") speech. After this speech, Palmerston's popularity had never been greater.<ref>Ridley, pp. 387\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Crossing the Queen and resigning, 1851===\nNotwithstanding his parliamentary triumph in the Don Pacifico affair, many of his own colleagues and supporters criticized the spirit in which the foreign relations of the Crown were carried on. The Queen addressed a minute to the Prime Minister in which she recorded her dissatisfaction at the manner in which Palmerston evaded the obligation to submit his measures for the royal sanction as failing in sincerity to the Crown. This minute was communicated to Palmerston, who accepted its criticisms.<ref>Ridley, pp. 394\u2013395.</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 1851, [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] \u2013 who had been elected President of France in 1848 \u2013 carried out a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by dissolving the National Assembly and arresting the leading Republicans. Palmerston privately congratulated Napoleon on his triumph, noting that Britain's constitution was rooted in history but that France had had five revolutions since 1789, with the [[French Constitution of 1848]] being a \"day-before-yesterday tomfoolery which the scatterbrain heads of [[Armand Marrast|Marrast]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] invented for the torment and perplexity of the French nation\".<ref>Ridley, p. 398.</ref> However, the Cabinet decided that Britain must be neutral, and so Palmerston requested his officials to be diplomatic. Palmerston's widespread support among the press, educated public opinion, and ordinary Britons caused apprehension and distrust among other politicians and angered the Court. Prince Albert complained Palmerston had sent a dispatch without showing the Sovereign. Protesting innocence, Palmerston resigned.<ref>Ridley, pp. 398\u2013399.</ref><ref>David Brown, \"The power of public opinion: Palmerston and the crisis of December 1851.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 20.3 (2001): 333\u2013358.</ref>\n\n==Home Secretary: 1852\u20131855==\nAfter a brief period of Conservative minority government, the [[George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] became Prime Minister in a coalition government of Whigs and Peelites (with [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]] taking the role of Foreign Secretary and Leader of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]). It was regarded as impossible for them to form a government without Palmerston, so he was made [[Home Secretary]] in December 1852. Many people considered this a curious appointment because Palmerston's expertise was so obviously in foreign affairs.<ref>Ridley, pp. 413\u2013414.</ref> There was a story that after a great wave of strikes swept Northern England, the Queen summoned Palmerston to discuss the situation. When she enquired after the latest news, Palmerston is said to have replied: \"There is no definite news, Madam, but it seems certain that the Turks have crossed the Danube\".<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 414\">Ridley, p. 414.</ref>\n\n===Social reform===\nPalmerston passed the Factory Act 1853 which removed loopholes in previous [[Factory Acts]] and outlawed all labour by young persons between 6pm and 6am.  He attempted to pass a Bill that confirmed the rights of workers to combine but this was thrown out by the House of Lords. He introduced the [[Truck Acts|Truck Act]] which stopped the practice of employers paying workmen in goods instead of money, or forcing them to purchase goods from shops owned by the employers.  In August 1853 Palmerston introduced the Smoke Abatement Act in order to combat the increasing smoke from coal fires, a problem greatly aggravated by the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\">Ridley, p. 407.</ref> He also oversaw the passage of the [[Vaccination Act 1853]] into law, which was introduced as a private member's bill, and which Palmerston persuaded the government to support.  The Act made vaccination of children compulsory for the first time.  Palmerston outlawed the burying of the dead in churches.  The right to bury the dead in churches was held by wealthy families whose ancestors had purchased the right in the past.  Palmerston opposed this practice on public health grounds and ensured that all bodies were buried in a churchyard or public cemetery.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\"/>\n\n===Penal reform===\nPalmerston reduced the period in which prisoners could be held in [[solitary confinement]] from eighteen months to nine months.<ref>Ridley, p. 408.</ref> He also ended transportation to [[Tasmania]] for prisoners by passing the Penal Servitude Act 1853, which also reduced the maximum sentences for most offences.<ref>Ridley, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Palmerston passed the Reformatory Schools Act 1854 which gave the Home Secretary powers to send juvenile prisoners to a reformatory school instead of prison. He was forced to accept an amendment which ensured that the prisoner had to have spent at least three months in jail first.<ref>Ridley, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> When in October 1854 Palmerston visited [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst]] jail and conversed with three boy inmates, he was impressed by their behaviour and ordered that they be sent to a reformatory school. He found the ventilation in the cells unsatisfactory and ordered that they be improved.<ref>Ridley, p. 410.</ref>\n\nPalmerston strongly opposed [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s plans for giving the vote to sections of the urban working-classes. When the Cabinet agreed in December 1853 to introduce a bill during the next session of Parliament in the form which Russell wanted, Palmerston resigned. However, Aberdeen told him that no definite decision on reform had been taken and persuaded Palmerston to return to the Cabinet.  The electoral Reform Bill did not pass Parliament that year.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 403-405.</ref>\n\n===Crimean War===\nPalmerston's exile from his traditional realm of the Foreign Office meant he did not have full control over British policy during the events precipitating the [[Crimean War]]. One of his biographers, [[Jasper Ridley]], argues that had he been in control of foreign policy at this time, war in the Crimea would have been avoided.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 414.</ref> Palmerston argued in Cabinet, after Russian troops concentrated on the Ottoman border in February 1853, that the Royal Navy should join the French fleet in the [[Dardanelles]] as a warning to Russia. He was overruled, however.\n\nIn May 1853 the Russians threatened to invade the principalities [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] unless the Ottoman Sultan surrendered to their demands. Palmerston argued for immediate decisive action; the Royal Navy should be sent to the Dardanelles to assist the Turkish navy and that Britain should inform Russia of the intention to go to war if it invaded the principalities. However, Aberdeen objected to all of Palmerston's proposals. After prolonged arguments, a reluctant Aberdeen agreed to send a fleet to the Dardanelles but objected to his other proposals. The Russian Emperor was annoyed by Britain's actions but it was not enough to deter him. When the British fleet arrived at the Dardanelles the weather was rough so the fleet took refuge in the outer waters of the straits. The Russians argued that this was a violation of the [[Straits Convention]] of 1841 and therefore invaded the two principalities. Palmerston thought that this was the result of British weakness and thought that if the Russians had been told that if they invaded the principalities the British and French fleets would enter the [[Bosphorus]] or the [[Black Sea]], they would have been deterred.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 415\u2013416.</ref> In Cabinet, Palmerston argued for a vigorous prosecution of the war against Russia by Britain but Aberdeen objected, as he wanted peace. Public opinion was on the side of the Turks and with Aberdeen becoming steadily unpopular, [[Lord Dudley Stuart]] in February 1854 noted, \"Wherever I go, I have heard but one opinion on the subject, and that one opinion has been pronounced in a single word, or in a single name \u2013 Palmerston.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:British General Cathcart death at Inkerman.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Battle of Inkerman]], November 1854]]\n\nOn 28 March 1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia for refusing to withdraw from the principalities. The war progressed slowly, with no gains in the Baltic and slow gains in Crimea at the long [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]].  Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos and failures, especially the mismanagement of the heroic [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. The health and living conditions of the British soldiers was notorious and the press, with correspondents in the field, made the most of it. Tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dick |last=Leonard|title=The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|url={{Google books|7Kosl75aYPAC|The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|page=98|plainurl=yes}}|year=2013|publisher=I.B.

Derby offered Palmerston the office of Secretary of State for War which he accepted under the condition that [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] remained as Foreign Secretary. Clarendon refused and so Palmerston refused Derby's offer and Derby subsequently gave up trying to form a government. The Queen sent for [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]] but he was too old to accept:  so she asked Russell; but none of his former colleagues except Palmerston wanted to serve under him. Having exhausted the possible alternatives, the Queen invited Palmerston to Buckingham Palace on 4 February 1855 to form a government.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 433-36.</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1855\u20131858==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[First premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Whig government, 1855\u20131858}}\n\nAged 70 years, 109 days, Palmerston became the oldest person in British political history to be appointed Prime Minister for the first time. As of 2020 no Prime Minister entering [[10 Downing Street]] for the first time since Palmerston has surpassed his record.\n\n===Ending the Crimean War===\n[[File:Lord Palmerston 1855.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Lord Palmerston, c. 1855 by Francis Cruikshank]]\nPalmerston took a hard line on the war; he wanted to expand the fighting, especially in the Baltic where St. Petersburg could be threatened by superior British naval power. His goal was to permanently reduce the Russian threat to Europe. Sweden and Prussia were willing to join, and Russia stood alone. However, France, which had sent far more soldiers to the war than Britain, and had suffered far more casualties, wanted the war to end, as did Austria.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010) pp 402\u2013408</ref>  In March 1855 the old Tsar died and was succeeded by his son, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who wished to make peace. However, Palmerston found the peace terms too soft on Russia and so persuaded [[Napoleon III of France]] to break off the peace negotiations until Sevastopol could be captured, putting the allies in a stronger negotiating position. In September Sevastopol finally surrendered and the allies had full control of the Black Sea theatre. Russia came to terms. On 27 February 1856 an armistice was signed and after a month's negotiations an agreement was signed at the [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Congress of Paris]]. Palmerston's demand for a demilitarised Black Sea was secured, although his wish for the Crimea to be returned to the Ottomans was not. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|peace treaty]] was signed on 30 March 1856. In April 1856 Palmerston was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]] by Victoria.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 437-53/</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Palmerston-engraving.jpg|thumb|Original engraving by D.J.

When the Chinese Commissioner [[Ye Mingchen]] refused to apologize, the British shelled his compound. The commissioner retaliated with a proclamation that called on the people of Canton to \"unite in exterminating these troublesome English villains\" and offered a $100 bounty for the head of any Englishman. The [[Thirteen Factories|British factories]] outside the city were also burned to the ground by incensed locals. Palmerston supported Parkes while in Parliament the British policy was strongly attacked on moral grounds by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[William Gladstone]]. Playing the patriotism card, Palmerston said that Cobden demonstrated \"an anti-English feeling, an abnegation of all those ties which bind men to their country and to their fellow countrymen, which I should hardly have expected from the lips of any member of this House. Everything that was English was wrong, and everything that was hostile to England was right.\"<ref name=R467>Ridley, p. 467.</ref> He went on to say that if a motion of censure was carried it would signal that the House had voted to \"abandon a large community of British subjects at the extreme end of the globe to a set of barbarians \u2013 a set of kidnapping, murdering, poisoning barbarians.\"<ref name=R467/> The censure motion was carried by a majority of sixteen and the [[1857 United Kingdom general election|election of 1857 followed]]. Palmerston's stance proved popular among a large section of the workers, the growing middle classes and the country's commercial and financial interests. With the expanded franchise, his party swept on a wave of popular feeling to a majority of 83, the largest since 1835. Cobden and [[John Bright]] lost their seats.\n\nIn China the [[Second Opium War]] (1856\u20131860) was another humiliating defeat for a Qing dynasty,<ref>J. Y. Wong, ''Deadly Dreams: Opium, Imperialism, and the Arrow War (1856\u20131860) in China'' (1998)</ref> already reeling as a result of the domestic [[Taiping Rebellion]].\n\n===Resignation===\n[[Image:Lord-Palmerston-Addressing-The-House-Of-Commons-During-The-Debates-On-The-Treaty-Of-France-In-February-1860,-1863.jpg|thumb|250px|Lord Palmerston Addressing the House of Commons During the Debates on the [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|Treaty of France]] in February 1860, as painted by [[John Phillip]] (1863)]]\nAfter the election, Palmerston passed the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]], which for the first time made it possible for courts to grant a divorce and removed divorce from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. The opponents in Parliament, who included Gladstone, were the first in British history to try to kill a bill by filibuster. Nonetheless, Palmerston was determined to get the bill through, which he did.  In June news came to Britain of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Palmerston sent Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] and reinforcements to India. Palmerston also agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown. This was enacted in the [[Government of India Act 1858]].  After the Italian republican [[Felice Orsini]] tried to assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see [[Orsini affair]]). Palmerston introduced a Conspiracy to Murder bill, which made it a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. At first reading, the Conservatives voted for it but at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 he was forced to resign.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 472-82.</ref>\n\n==Opposition: 1858\u20131859==\nThe Conservatives lacked a majority, and Russell introduced a resolution in March 1859 arguing for widening the franchise, which the Conservatives opposed but which was carried. Parliament was dissolved and [[1859 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] ensued, which the Whigs won. Palmerston rejected an offer from Disraeli to become Conservative leader, but he attended the meeting of 6 June 1859 in Willis's Rooms at St James Street, where the Liberal Party was formed. The Queen asked [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]] to form a government, but although Palmerston agreed to serve under him, Russell did not. Therefore, on 12 June the Queen asked Palmerston to become prime minister. Russell and Gladstone agreed to serve under him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Victoria |title=The Letters of Queen Victoria: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog|year=1907|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog/page/n483 439]\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1859\u20131865==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Liberal government, 1859\u20131866}}\nHistorians usually regard Palmerston, starting in 1859, as the first Liberal.<ref>David Loades, ed., '' Readers Guide to British History'' (2003) 2: 998</ref> In his last premiership Palmerston oversaw the passage of important legislation.

The MP Sir [[William Henry Gregory|William Gregory]] was told by a member of the Cabinet that \"at the beginning of each session and after each holiday, Mr Gladstone used to come in charged to the muzzle with all sorts of schemes of all sorts of reforms which were absolutely necessary in his opinion to be immediately undertaken. Palmerston used to look fixedly at the paper before him, saying nothing until there was a lull in Gladstone's outpouring. He then rapped the table and said cheerfully: 'Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business'.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 563.</ref> Palmerston told Lord Shaftesbury: \"Gladstone will soon have it all his own way and whenever he gets my place we shall have strange doings\". He told another friend that he thought Gladstone would wreck the Liberal Party and end up in a madhouse.<ref>Ridley, p. 566.</ref>\n\nWhen in May 1864 the MP [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines]] introduced a Reform Bill in the Commons, Palmerston ordered Gladstone to not commit himself and the government to any particular scheme.<ref>Philip Guedalla (ed.), ''Gladstone and Palmerston, being the Correspondence of Lord Palmerston with Mr. Gladstone 1851\u20131865'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1928), p. 279.</ref> Instead Gladstone said in his speech in the Commons that he did not see why any man should not have the vote unless he was mentally incapacitated, but added that this would not come about unless the working class showed an interest in reform. Palmerston believed that this was incitement to the working class to begin agitating for reform and told Gladstone: \"What every Man and Woman too have a Right to, is to be well governed and under just Laws, and they who propose a change ought to shew that the present organization does not accomplish those objects\".<ref>Guedalla, p. 282.</ref>\n\n[[Second Italian War of Independence|French intervention in Italy]] had created an invasion scare and Palmerston established a [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] which reported in 1860. It recommended a huge [[Palmerston Forts|programme of fortifications]] to protect the [[Royal Navy Dockyards]] and ports, which Palmerston vigorously supported. Objecting to the enormous expense, Gladstone repeatedly threatened to resign as Chancellor when the proposals were accepted. Palmerston said that he had received so many resignation letters from Gladstone that he feared that they would set fire to the chimney.<ref>Ridley, p. 564.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Lord Lyons===\nDuring the advent and occurrence of the [[American Civil War]], the British Ambassador to the United States was Palmerston's close friend and ally [[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons, 2nd Baron Lyons]]. Palmerston had first appointed Richard Lyons to the Foreign Service in 1839, and was a close friend of his father, [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons]], with whom he had vehemently advocated increased aggression in the [[Crimean War]]. Palmerston and Lyons both had similar sociopolitical sympathies: both advocated monarchy and foreign interventionism. Throughout the American Civil War, Palmerston and Richard Lyons maintained an extensive confidential correspondence. Their actions were responsible for the peaceful resolution of the [[Trent Affair]]. When Lyons resigned from the position of American Ambassador, Palmerston attempted to persuade him to return, but Lyons declined the offer.<ref name=\"Jenkins Lyons\">{{cite book|title=Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War|author=Jenkins, Brian|publisher=McGill-Queen\u2019s Press, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\nPalmerston's sympathies in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) were with the secessionist [[Confederate States of America]]. Although a professed opponent of the slave trade and [[slavery]], he held a lifelong hostility towards the United States, and believed a dissolution of the Union would weaken America, thereby enhancing British power. Additionally, the Confederacy \"would afford a valuable and extensive market for British manufactures\".<ref>Ridley, p. 552.</ref><ref>Kevin Peraino, \"Lincoln vs. Palmerston\" in Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 120\u201369.</ref>\n\nBritain issued a [[s:British proclamation of neutrality in the American Civil War|proclamation of neutrality]] at the beginning of the Civil War on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognised as a [[belligerent]] but it was too premature to recognise it as a sovereign state. The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[William Seward]], threatened to treat as hostile any country which recognised the Confederacy. Britain depended more on American corn than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain's economic interest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Paterson|author2=J.

He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but 15 months later he felt: <blockquote>\"...the American War... has manifestly ceased to have any attainable object as far as the Northerns are concerned, except to get rid of some more thousand troublesome Irish and Germans. It must be owned, however, that the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides have shown courage and endurance highly honourable to their stock.\"<ref name=R559>Ridley, p. 559.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]] in November 1861 produced public outrage in Britain and a diplomatic crisis. A U.S. Navy warship stopped the British steamer ''Trent'' and seized two Confederate envoys ''en route'' to Europe.  Palmerston called the action \"a declared and gross insult\", demanded the release of the two diplomats and ordered 3,000 troops to Canada.  In a letter to Queen Victoria on 5 December 1861 he said that if his demands were not met: <blockquote>\"Great Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon be forgotten.\"<ref name=R554>Ridley, p. 554.</ref></blockquote> In another letter to his foreign secretary, he predicted war between Britain and the Union:\n<blockquote>\"It is difficult not to come to the conclusion that the rabid hatred of England which animates the exiled Irishmen who direct almost all the Northern newspapers, will so excite the masses as to make it impossible for Lincoln and Seward to grant our demands; and we must therefore look forward to war as the probable result.\"<ref name=R554/></blockquote>\nIn fact, Irishmen did not control any major newspapers in the North, and the U.S. decided to release the prisoners rather than risk war. Palmerston was convinced the presence of troops in Canada persuaded the U.S. to acquiesce.<ref>Kenneth Bourne, \"British Preparations for War with the North, 1861\u20131862,\" ''The English Historical Review'' Vol 76 No 301 (Oct 1961) pp 600\u2013632 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/558199 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAfter President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s announcement in September 1862 that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in ninety days, the cabinet debated intervention as a humanitarian move to stop a likely race war. At the same time however there was a cabinet crisis in France over the overthrow of the Greek king and the growing Eastern Question with regard to Russia. The British Government had to determine whether the situation in North America or the containment of Russia was more urgent. The decision was to give priority to threats closer to home and to decline France's suggestion of a joint intervention in America; the threatened race war over slavery never happened.<ref>Niels Eichhorn,  \"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 15.3 (2014): 287\u2013310.</ref> Palmerston rejected all further efforts of the Confederacy to gain British recognition.<ref name=\"R559\"/>\n[[Image:Lord Palmerston 1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carte de visite]] depicting Lord Palmerston, 1863]]\n\nThe raiding ship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], built in the British port of [[Birkenhead]], was another difficulty for Palmerston. On 29 July 1862, a law officer's report he had commissioned advised him to detain ''Alabama'', as its construction was a breach of Britain's neutrality. Palmerston ordered ''Alabama'' detained on 31 July, but it had already put to sea before the order reached Birkenhead. In her subsequent cruise, ''Alabama'' captured or destroyed many Union merchant ships, as did other raiders fitted out in Britain.  The U.S. accused Britain of complicity in the construction of the raiders.  This was the basis of the postwar [[Alabama claims|''Alabama'' claims]] for damages against Britain, which Palmerston refused to pay.  After his death, Gladstone acknowledged the U.S. claim and agreed to arbitration, paying out $15,500,000 in damages.\n\nIn the autumn of 1862, Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, opened a cabinet debate on whether Britain should intervene. Gladstone had a favourable image of the Confederacy, and indeed of slavery (his family wealth depended on slavery in the [[British West Indies|West Indies]]). He emphasized the humanitarian intervention to stop the staggering death toll, risk of a race war, and failure of the Union to achieve decisive military results, but Prime Minister Palmerston had other concerns at the same time, including a crisis connected with the overthrow of the Greek king, which put the Eastern Question in play. The Cabinet decided that the American situation was less urgent than the need to contain Russian expansion,  so it rejected Gladstone's suggestions.<ref>Niels Eichhorn, \"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 15#3 (2014) pp 287\u2013310.</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nThe [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]] wanted to annex the Danish territory of [[Schleswig]] and the German territory of [[Holstein]], whose Duke was the King of Denmark, chiefly for its port of [[Kiel]], and had an alliance with Austria for this purpose. In a speech to the Commons on 23 July 1863, Palmerston said the British government, like those of France and Russia, wished that \"the independence, the integrity, and the rights of Denmark may be maintained. We are convinced\u2014I am convinced at least\u2014that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow those rights and interfere with that independence, those who made the attempt would find in the result that it would not be Denmark alone with which they would have to contend\".<ref>Ridley, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref> Palmerston's stance derived from the traditional belief that France was the greater threat to Britain and was much stronger than Austria and Prussia.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\">Ridley, p. 571.</ref>\n\nFor five months Bismarck did nothing. However, in November the Danish government instituted a new constitution whereby Holstein was bound closer to Denmark. Schleswig had already been a part of Denmark for centuries. By the year's end, the Prussian and Austrian armies were massing on the [[River Eider]]. On 1 February 1864 the Prussian-Austrian armies [[Second Schleswig War|invaded Schleswig-Holstein]], and ten days afterwards the Danish government requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his soldiers that were placed on the borders of Prussia's Rhineland provinces. Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\"/>\n\nIn April Austria's navy was on its way to attack Copenhagen, and Palmerston saw the Austrian ambassador and informed him that Britain could not allow their navy to sail through the English Channel if their intent was to attack Denmark, and if it entered the Baltic the result would be war with Britain. The ambassador replied that the Austrian navy would not enter the Baltic and it did not do so.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\">Ridley, p. 572.</ref>\n\nPalmerston accepted Russell's suggestion that the war should be settled at a conference, but at the ensuing [[London Conference of 1864]] in May and June the Danes refused to accept their loss of Schleswig-Holstein. The armistice ended on 26 June and Prussian-Austrian troops quickly invaded more of Denmark. On 25 June the Cabinet was against going to war to save Denmark, but Russell's suggestion to send the Royal Navy to defend Copenhagen was only carried by Palmerston's vote. Palmerston, however, said the fleet could not be sent in view of the deep division in the Cabinet.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\"/>\n\nOn 27 June Palmerston gave his statement to the Commons and said Britain would not go to war with the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or that Denmark's capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a vote of censure in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP [[Jonathan Peel|General Peel]] said: \"It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England{{sic}}, uttered in the Parliament of England{{sic}}, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers?\"  Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: \"I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who say she had fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided\".<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 573-74.</ref>\n\nThe vote of censure was defeated by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston's old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran up the stairs to the Ladies' Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: \"What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at three o'clock in the morning, and eighty years of age!\"<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 574.</ref>\n\nIn a speech at his constituency at [[Tiverton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tiverton]] in August, Palmerston told his constituents:\n\n<blockquote>I am sure every Englishman who has a heart in his breast and a feeling of justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword successfully in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which it was not possible to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture\u2014not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.<ref>\u2018Lord Palmerston At Tiverton\u2019, ''The Times'' (24 August 1864), p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEuropean leaders watched in confusion, unable to settle the matter by peaceful compromise. British diplomacy was in the same state.  His biographer William Baring Pemberton noticed: \"Palmerston's failure to understand Bismarck lies at the root of his misunderstanding of the Schleswig-Holstein question, and it derived from an old man's inability to adapt himself to a changing world\".<ref>William Baring Pemberton, ''Lord Palmerston'' (Batchworth Press, 1954)  p.332</ref>  Thus Britain was unable to stop Prussia and misunderstood Bismarck's ambitions. Russian historian Vinogradov V. N. writes: \"In place of the former insight came bias in judgments and stubbornness in defending outdated views. Palmerston continued to consider Prussia as \"instrument in the hands of Austria\", its army - weak and doomed to defeat, and its public - consisting of romantically minded students and dreamy professors. And Otto von Bismarck quietly annexed to the Prussia two Duchies, and at the same time the County of Lauenburg\".<ref>Vinogradov V.N. Lord Parmerston in European diplomacy. New and recent history. 2006. N5. In Russian.</ref> Britain actually approved the first step to the emergence of the Reich, to the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|\"blood and iron\"]].\n\n===Electoral victory===\nPalmerston won another [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election in July 1865]], increasing his majority.  The leadership of Palmerston was a great electoral asset to the Liberal Party.<ref>Ridley, p. 579.</ref> He then had to deal with the outbreak of [[Fenian]] violence in Ireland. Palmerston ordered the [[Viceroy of Ireland]], [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Wodehouse]], to take measures against this, including a possible suspension of trial-by-jury and a monitoring of Americans travelling to Ireland. He believed that the [[Fenian]] agitation was caused by America. On 27 September 1865 he wrote to the Secretary for War:\n<blockquote>The American assault on Ireland under the name of Fenianism may be now held to have failed, but the snake is only scotched and not killed. It is far from impossible that the American conspirators may try and obtain in our North American provinces compensation for their defeat in Ireland.<ref>Ridley, p. 581.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe advised that more armaments be sent to Canada and more troops be sent to Ireland. During these last few weeks of his life, Palmerston pondered on developments in foreign affairs. He began thinking of a new friendship with France as \"a sort of preliminary defensive alliance\" against America and looked forward to Prussia becoming more powerful as this would balance against the growing threat from Russia.  In a letter to Russell he warned that Russia \"will in due time become a power almost as great as the old Roman Empire&nbsp;... Germany ought to be strong in order to resist Russian aggression.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 582.</ref> Palmerston's successors had a very different task-to restrain an aggressive Germany.\n\n==Death==\nPalmerston enjoyed robust health in old age,<ref>Hibbert, Christopher ''Disraeli: A Personal History'' (2004) p. 256</ref> living at [[Romsey]] in his home Foxhills, built in about 1840. On 12 October 1865 he caught a chill, and instead of retiring immediately to bed he spent an hour and a half [[Death during consensual sex#Notable cases|dawdling]]. He then had a violent fever but his condition stabilised for the next few days. However, on the night of 17 October his health worsened, and when his doctor asked him if he believed in regeneration of the world through Jesus Christ, Palmerston replied: \"Oh, surely.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\">Ridley, p. 583.</ref> His last words were, \"That's Article 98; now go on to the next.\" (He was thinking about diplomatic treaties.)<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\"/> An apocryphal version of his last words is: \"Die, my dear doctor? That is the last thing I shall do.\" He died at 10:45 am on Wednesday, 18 October 1865 two days before his eighty-first birthday. Although Palmerston wanted to be buried at [[Romsey Abbey]], the Cabinet insisted that he should have a [[state funeral]] and be buried at [[Westminster Abbey]], which he was, on 27 October 1865. He was the fourth person not of royalty to be granted a state funeral (after [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]).\n\nQueen Victoria wrote after his death that though she regretted his passing, she had never liked or respected him: \"Strange, and solemn to think of that strong, determined man, with so much worldly ambition \u2013 gone! He had often worried and distressed us, though as Pr. Minister he had behaved ''very well''.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\">Ridley, p. 584.</ref> [[Florence Nightingale]] reacted differently upon hearing of his death: \"He will be a great loss to us. Tho' he made a joke when asked to do the right thing, he always did it. No one else will be able to carry things thro' the Cabinet as he did. I shall lose a powerful protector...He was so much more in earnest than he appeared. He did not do himself justice.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\"/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his stepson [[William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple|William Cowper-Temple]] (later created [[Baron Mount Temple|The 1st Baron Mount Temple]]), whose inheritance included a 10,000-acre estate in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]], on which his stepfather had commissioned the building of the incomplete [[Classiebawn Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sligoheritage.com/archirishvillage.htm|title= Profile of an Irish Village-Palmerston and the Conquest, Colonisation and Evolution of Mullaghmore, Co. Sligo|accessdate = 26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Algernon Cecil, summed up his greatness:\n: Palmerston placed his trust... in the Press which he was at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper he knew how to catch and the weight of his name and resources he brought to bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effontry that has never been excelled.<ref>Algernon Cecil, ''British Foreign Secretaries, 1807\u20131916'' (1927) p 139</ref>\n\nPalmerston has traditionally been viewed as \"a Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad\".<ref>Ridley, p. 587.</ref> He believed that the British constitution as secured by the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 was the best which human hands had made, with a constitutional monarchy subject to the laws of the land but retaining some political power. He supported the rule of law and opposed further democratisation after the [[Reform Act 1832]]. He wished to see this liberal system of a mixed constitution in-between the two extremes of absolute monarchy and republican democracy replace the absolute monarchies on the Continent.<ref>Ridley, p. 588.</ref> More recently some historians have seen his domestic policies as Prime Minister as not merely liberal but genuinely progressive by the standards of his era.<ref>David Steele, ''Palmerston and Liberalism, 1855\u20131865'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991).</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Capture of the King of Delhi by Captain Hodson\".jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Palmerston agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown.]]\nHowever, it is in foreign affairs that Palmerston is chiefly remembered. Palmerston's principal aim in foreign policy was to advance the national interests of England.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\"/> Palmerston is famous for his patriotism. [[Lord John Russell]] said that \"his heart always beat for the honour of England\".<ref>''The Times'' (10 November 1865), p. 7.</ref> Palmerston believed it was in Britain's interests that liberal governments be established on the Continent. He also practised brinkmanship and bluff in that he was prepared to threaten war to achieve Britain's interests.<ref>Ridely, p. 589.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's foreign policy achievements were very short-term. The peace conditions of the Congress of Paris collapsed with the defeat of France in the war with Prussia in 1870-71. The European balance was upset with the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia in 1871.\n\nWhen in 1886 [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] became Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's government, [[John Bright]] asked him if he had read about Palmerston's policies as Foreign Secretary. Rosebery replied that he had. \"Then\", said Bright, \"you know what to avoid. Do the exact opposite of what he did. His administration at the Foreign Office was one long crime.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 591.</ref> The [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]] said of Palmerston in 1866: \"He loved his country and his country loved him. He lived for her honour, and she will cherish his memory.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Edinburgh Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miQ4AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA275|year=1866|page=275}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Gladstone recounted a story of when \"a Frenchman, thinking to be highly complimentary, said to Palmerston: 'If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman'; to which Pam coolly replied: 'If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\">Ridley, p. 589.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] campaigned for rearmament in the 1930s, he was compared to Palmerston in warning the nation to look to its defences.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Winston Churchill. The Wilderness Years'' (London: Book Club Associates, 1981), pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> The policy of [[appeasement]] led General [[Jan Smuts]] to write in 1936 that \"we are afraid of our shadows. I sometimes long for a ruffian like Palmerston or any man who would be more than a string of platitudes and apologies.\"<ref>W. K. Hancock, ''Smuts. Volume II: The Fields of Force. 1919\u20131950'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 281.</ref>\n\nHe was also an avowed [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] whose attempts to abolish the slave trade was one of the most consistent elements of his foreign policy. His opposition to the slave trade created tensions with South American countries and the United States over his insistence that the [[Royal Navy]] had the right to search the vessels of any country if they suspected the vessels were being used in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].\n\nHistorian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] has summarised his career by emphasising the paradoxes:\n:For twenty years junior minister in a Tory government, he became the most successful of Whig Foreign Secretaries; though always a Conservative, he ended his life by presiding over the transition from Whiggism to Liberalism. He was the exponent of British strength, yet was driven from office for truckling to a foreign despot; he preached the Balance of Power, yet helped to inaugurate the policy of isolation and of British withdrawal from Europe. Irresponsible and flippant, he became the first hero of the serious middle-class electorate. He reached high office solely through an irregular family connection; he retained it through skilful use of the press\u2014the only Prime Minister to become an accomplished leader-writer.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, \"Lord Palmerston,\" ''History Today'' Jan 1991, Vol. 41#1 p 1</ref>\n\nPalmerston is also remembered for his light-hearted approach to government. He is once said to have claimed of a particularly intractable problem relating to [[Schleswig-Holstein question|Schleswig-Holstein]], that only three people had ever understood the problem: one was [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], who was dead; the second was a German professor, who had gone insane; and the third was himself, who had forgotten it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Douglas|last1=Hurd|author1-link=Douglas Hurd|title=Choose Your Weapons: The British Foreign Secretary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpBc5JZsd5gC&pg=RA1-PR33#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-85851-5|page=33}}</ref>\n\n''The Life of Lord Palmerston up to 1847'' was written by Lord Dalling ([[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Sir H.

The whole work was reissued in a revised and slightly abridged form by Ashley in 2 volumes in 1879, with the title ''The Life and Correspondence of Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston''; the letters are judiciously curtailed, but unfortunately without indicating where the excisions occur; the appendices of the original work are omitted, but much fresh matter is added, and this edition is undoubtedly the standard biography.<ref>Stanley Lane-Poole, '[[s:Temple, Henry John (DNB00)|Temple, Henry John]]', ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885\u20131900, Volume 56''.</ref>\n\n===Places named===\n[[File:Palmerston - geograph.org.uk - 259077.jpg|thumb|right|Palmerston's Memorial in Southampton]]\n*The Town of [[Palmerston, Ontario|Palmerston]] located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada was founded and named after Lord Palmerston in 1875.

During the [[Congo Crisis]], Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of nationalist [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba's execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country's armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965 to become the country's [[military dictator]].\n\nTo consolidate his power, he established the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] as the [[One-party state|sole legal political party]] in 1967, changed the Congo's name to ''Zaire'' in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972.

From 1972 onwards, he was also supported by [[Mao Zedong]] of [[China]], mainly due to his [[anti-Soviet]] stance, but also as part of Mao's attempts to create a bloc of Afro-Asian nations led by him; the massive Chinese economic aid that flowed into Zaire allowed Mobutu more flexibility in his dealings with Western governments, gave him the chance to portray himself as an \"anti-capitalist revolutionary\", and enabled him to avoid going to the [[International Monetary Fund]] for assistance.<ref>Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao: the Unknown Story, p. 574, 2006 edition, Anchor Books</ref>\n\nBy 1991, economic deterioration and unrest led him to agree to share power with opposition leaders, but he used the army to thwart change until May 1997, when rebel forces led by [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] expelled him from the country.

Yemo relied on the help of relatives to support her four children, and the family moved often. Mobutu's earliest education took place in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], but his mother eventually sent him to an uncle in [[Mbandaka|Coquilhatville]], where he attended the Christian Brothers School, a Catholic-mission boarding school. A physically imposing figure, Mobutu dominated school sports. He also excelled in academic subjects and ran the class newspaper. He was known for his pranks and impish sense of humor.\n\nA classmate recalled that when the Belgian priests, whose first language was Dutch, made an error in French, Mobutu would leap to his feet in class and point out the mistake. Mobutu stowed away aboard a boat to [[L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1949, where he met a girl. The priests found him several weeks later. At the end of the school year, in lieu of being sent to prison, he was ordered to serve seven years in the colonial army, the [[Force Publique]] (FP). This was the usual punishment for rebellious students.<ref>Wrong, pp. 72\u201374</ref>\n\n===Army service===\nMobutu found discipline in army life, as well as a father figure in Sergeant [[Louis Bobozo]]. Mobutu kept up his studies by borrowing European newspapers from the Belgian officers and books from wherever he could find them, reading them on sentry duty and whenever he had a spare moment. His favourites were the writings of French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]], and Italian Renaissance philosopher [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]. After passing a course in accounting, Mobutu began to dabble professionally in journalism. Still angry after his clashes with the school priests, he did not marry in a church. His contribution to the wedding festivities was a crate of beer, all his army salary could afford.<ref>Wrong, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n=== Early political involvement ===\nAs a soldier, Mobutu wrote pseudonymously on contemporary politics for ''Actualit\u00e9s Africaines'' (African News), a magazine set up by a Belgian colonial. In 1956, he quit the army and became a full-time journalist,<ref>Wrong, p. 75</ref> writing for the L\u00e9opoldville daily ''[[L'Avenir (newspaper)|L'Avenir]]''.<ref>Crawford Young and Thomas Turner, ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State'', p. 175</ref>\n\nTwo years later, he went to Belgium to cover the [[Expo '58|1958 World Exposition]] and stayed to receive training in journalism. By this time, Mobutu had met many of the young Congolese intellectuals who were challenging colonial rule. He became friendly with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and joined Lumumba's [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC). Mobutu eventually became Lumumba's personal aide. Several contemporaries indicate that Belgian intelligence had recruited Mobutu to be an informer to the government.<ref>Wrong, pp. 76</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960 talks in Brussels on Congolese independence, the US embassy held a reception for the Congolese delegation. Embassy staff were each assigned a list of delegation members to meet, and discussed their impressions afterward. The ambassador noted, \"One name kept coming up. But it wasn't on anyone's list because he wasn't an official delegation member, he was Lumumba's secretary. But everyone agreed that this was an extremely intelligent man, very young, perhaps immature, but a man with great potential.\"<ref>Wrong, p. 67</ref>\n\nFollowing the general election, Lumumba was tasked with creating a government. He gave Mobutu the office of Secretary of State to the Presidency. Mobutu held much influence in the final determination of the rest of the government.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=113}}\n\n===Congo Crisis===\n{{main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Colonel Mobutu.jpg|thumb|Colonel Mobutu in 1960]]\nOn 5 July 1960, soldiers of the Force Publique stationed at Camp L\u00e9opold II in L\u00e9opoldville, dissatisfied with their all-white leadership and working conditions, [[Mutiny of the Force Publique|mutinied]]. The revolt spread across the region in the following days. Mobutu assisted other officials in negotiating with the mutineers to secure the release of the officers and their families.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=88\u201389}} On 8 July the full Council of Ministers convened in an extraordinary session under the chairmanship of President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] at Camp L\u00e9opold II to address the task of Africanising the garrison.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=191}}\n\nAfter allowing for the election of a new commandant for the garrison, the ministers debated over who would make a suitable army chief of staff. The two main candidates for the post were [[Maurice Mpolo]] and Mobutu. The former had shown some influence over the mutinying troops, but Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers feared that he would enact a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' if he were given power. The latter was perceived as calmer and more thoughtful.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=192}} Lumumba saw Mpolo as courageous, but favored Mobutu's prudence. As the discussions continued, the cabinet began to divide according to who they preferred to serve as chief of staff. Lumumba wanted to keep both men in his government and wished to avoid upsetting one of their camps of supporters.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=192}} In the end Mobutu was given the role and awarded the rank of colonel.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=193}} The following day government delegations left the capital to oversee the Africanisation of the army; Mobutu was sent to \u00c9quateur.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=92, 94}}\n\nEncouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Concerned that the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|United Nations force]] sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union]] for assistance. He received massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers within six weeks. As this was during the [[Cold War]], the US government feared that the Soviet activity was a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasa-Vubu was encouraged by the US and Belgium to dismiss Lumumba, which he did on 5 September. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasa-Vubu deposed. Parliament refused to recognise the dismissals and urged reconciliation, but no agreement was reached.\n\nLumumba and Kasa-Vubu each ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers' salaries, as well as Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu's subordinates, all favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On 14 September Mobutu launched a bloodless coup, declaring both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to be \"neutralised\" and establishing a new government of university graduates, the [[College of Commissioners-General]]. Lumumba rejected this action but was forced to retire to his residence, where UN peacekeepers prevented Mobutu's soldiers from arresting him.\n\nLosing confidence that the international community would support his reinstatement, Lumumba fled in late November to join his supporters in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] to establish a [[Free Republic of the Congo|new government]]. He was captured by Mobutu's troops in early December, and incarcerated at his headquarters in Thysville. However, Mobutu still considered him a threat, and transferred him to the rebelling [[State of Katanga]] on 17 January 1961. Lumumba disappeared from public view. It was later discovered that he was murdered the same day by the secessionist forces of [[Moise Tshombe]], after Mobutu's government turned him over.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Elizabeth|title=Foreign Intervention in Africa|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mobutu and Kasa-Vubu in 1961.jpg|thumb|Colonel Joseph-Desir\u00e9 Mobutu (left) with President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, 1961|left]]\nOn 23 January 1961, Kasa-Vubu promoted Mobutu to major-general. Historian De Witte argues that this was a political action, \"aimed to strengthen the army, the president's sole support, and Mobutu's position within the army\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Assassination_of_Lumumba.html?id=2Fl2lvKa_GEC|title=The Assassination of Lumumba|last=De Witte|first=Ludo|last2=Wright|first2=Ann|publisher=[[Verso Books]]|year=2002|isbn=978-1-85984-410-6|location=|page=127|author-link=Ludo De Witte|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Pierre Mulele]] led partisans in another rebellion. They quickly occupied two-thirds of the Congo. But the Congolese army, led by Mobutu, reconquered the entire territory through 1965.\n\n===Second ''coup'' and consolidation of power===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\nPrime Minister Moise Tshombe's [[Congolese National Convention]] had won a large majority in the [[1965 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|March 1965 elections]], but Kasa-Vubu appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, [[\u00c9variste Kimba]], as prime minister-designate. However, Parliament twice refused to confirm him. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup on 25 November.{{contradict-inline|reason=Infobox says November 24}} He had turned 35 a month earlier.<ref name=cs1>{{csref|country=zaire|author=Lemarchand, Ren\u00e9 |section=Mobutu's Second Coming}}</ref>\n\nUnder the auspices of a ''regime d'exception'' (the equivalent of a [[state of emergency]]), Mobutu assumed sweeping\u2014almost absolute\u2014powers for five years.<ref name=cs2>{{csref|country=zaire|author=Turner, Thomas |section=The Party-State as a System of Rule}}</ref> In his first speech upon taking power, Mobutu told a large crowd at L\u00e9opoldville's main stadium that, since politicians had brought the country to ruin in five years, it would take him at least that long to set things right again. Therefore, he announced, \"for five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country.\"<ref name=Anatomy/> Parliament was reduced to a rubber stamp before being abolished altogether, but it was later revived. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralized state.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Katoenen overhemd met portret van Mobutu TMnr 5829-1.jpg|thumb|A Congolese cotton shirt embellished with a portrait of Mobutu from the collection of the [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam]]\nInitially, Mobutu's government was decidedly apolitical, even anti-political. The word \"politician\" carried negative connotations, and became almost synonymous with someone who was wicked or corrupt. In 1966 the Corps of Volunteers of the Republic was established, a vanguard movement designed to mobilize popular support behind Mobutu, who was proclaimed the nation's \"Second National Hero\" after Lumumba. Despite the role he played in Lumumba's ouster, Mobutu worked to present himself as a successor to Lumumba's legacy. One of his key tenets early in his rule was \"authentic Congolese nationalism\".\n\n1967 marked the debut of the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party. Among the themes advanced by the MPR in its doctrine, the Manifesto of N'Sele, were nationalism, revolution, and \"authenticity\". Revolution was described as a \"truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic\", which called for \"the repudiation of both capitalism and communism\". One of the MPR's slogans was \"Neither left nor right\", to which would be added \"nor even center\" in later years.\n\nThat same year, all trade unions were consolidated into a single union, the National Union of Zairian Workers, and brought under government control. Mobutu intended for the union to serve as an instrument of support for government policy, rather than as an independent group. Independent trade unions were illegal until 1991.\n\n[[File:Mobutu swearing in, 1970.jpg|thumb|Mobutu sworn in as President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo following the 1970 election]]\nFacing many challenges early in his rule, Mobutu converted much opposition into submission through patronage; those he could not co-opt, he dealt with forcefully. In 1966, four cabinet members were arrested on charges of complicity in an attempted coup, tried by a military tribunal, and publicly executed in an open-air spectacle witnessed by over 50,000 people. Uprisings by former Katangan gendarmeries were crushed, as were the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] of 1967 led by white mercenaries.<ref>Anthony Mockler, 'The New Mercenaries,' Corgi Books, 1985, {{ISBN|0-552-12558-X}}.</ref> By 1970, nearly all potential threats to his authority had been smashed, and for the most part, law and order was brought to nearly all parts of the country. That year marked the pinnacle of Mobutu's legitimacy and power.\n\nIn 1970 [[Majesty|His Majesty]] [[Baudouin of the Belgians|King Baudouin of the Belgians]] made a highly successful state visit to [[Kinshasa]]. That same year [[1970 Democratic Republic of the Congo parliamentary election|legislative]] and [[1970 Democratic Republic of the Congo presidential election|presidential elections]] were held. The MPR was the only party allowed to run, although the constitution stated that at least two parties were authorized. According to official figures, an implausible 98.33% of voters voted in favor of the MPR list. For the presidential election, Mobutu was the only candidate. Voting was not secret; voters chose a green paper if they supported Mobutu's candidacy, and a red paper if they opposed his candidacy. Casting a green ballot was deemed a vote for hope, while a red ballot was deemed a vote for chaos. Under the circumstances, the result was inevitable\u2013Mobutu won with a vote of 10,131,669 to 157.<ref>Callaghy, Thomas M. ''The State-Society Struggle: Zaire in Comparative Perspective'', p. 164</ref> It later emerged that almost 30,500 more votes were cast than the actual number of registered voters.<ref name=EISA>[http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/drcsecondrepublic.htm DRC: Elections under the Second Republic] EISA</ref><ref>Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p294 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref>\n\nAs he consolidated power, Mobutu set up several military forces whose sole purpose was to protect him. These included the [[Special Presidential Division]], Civil Guard and Service for Action, and Military Intelligence (SNIP).\n\n===Authenticity campaign===\n{{main|Authenticit\u00e9 (Zaire)}}\n[[File:Flag of Zaire.svg|left|Flag of Zaire|thumb]]\n\nEmbarking on a campaign of pro-Africa cultural awareness, or ''[[authenticit\u00e9 (Zaire)|authenticit\u00e9]]'', Mobutu began renaming cities that reflected the colonial past, starting on 1 June 1966: Leopoldville became Kinshasa, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Stanleyville became Kisangani. In October 1971, he renamed the country as the [[Republic of Zaire]]. He ordered the people to change their European names to African ones, and priests were warned that they would face five years' imprisonment if they were caught [[Baptism|baptizing]] a Zairian child with a European name. Western attire and ties were banned, and men were forced to wear a [[Mao suit|Mao-style tunic]] known as an ''[[abacost]]'' (shorthand for ''\u00e0 bas le costume'', or \"down with the suit\").<ref>Shaw 2005, 63.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, in accordance with his own decree of a year earlier, Mobutu renamed himself ''Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga'' ( meaning \"The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.\"),<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w1V1AAAAMAAJ&q=%22The+warrior+who+knows+no+defeat+because+of+his+endurance+and+inflexible+will+and+is+all+powerful,+leaving+fire+in+his+wake+as+he+goes+from+conquest+to+conquest%22&dq=%22The+warrior+who+knows+no+defeat+because+of+his+endurance+and+inflexible+will+and+is+all+powerful,+leaving+fire+in+his+wake+as+he+goes+from+conquest+to+conquest%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv-7qpzOvWAhUCWBoKHcHeBaYQ6AEISzAG ''Zaire: Continuity and Political Change in an Oppressive State''], Winsome J.

Around this time, he eschewed his military uniform in favor of what would become his classic image\u2014the tall, imposing man wearing an abacost, thick-framed glasses, and leopard-skin [[toque]], and carrying a walking stick.\n\nIn 1974, a [[Constitution of Zaire|new constitution]] consolidated Mobutu's grip on the country. It defined the MPR as the \"single institution\" in the country. It was officially defined as \"the nation politically organized\"\u2014in essence, the state was a transmission belt for the party. All citizens automatically became members of the MPR from birth. The constitution stated that the MPR was embodied by the party's president, who was elected every seven years at its national convention. At the same time, the party president was automatically nominated as the sole candidate for a seven-year term as president of the republic; he was confirmed in office by a referendum.  The document vested the party president\u2013Mobutu\u2013with \"plentitude of power exercise,\" effectively codifying the dictatorial powers that Mobutu had exercised since 1965. A single list of MPR candidates was returned to the legislature every five years. For all intents and purposes, the Constitution placed all governing power in Mobutu's hands.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==One-man rule==\n[[File:Prince Bernhard and Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|270px|thumb|Mobutu Sese Seko with the Dutch [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]] in 1973]]\n\nEarly in his rule, Mobutu consolidated power by publicly executing political rivals, secessionists, coup plotters, and other threats to his rule. To set an example, many were [[hanging|hanged]] before large audiences. Such victims included former Prime Minister [[Evariste Kimba]], who, with three cabinet members\u2014J\u00e9r\u00f4me Anany (Defense Minister), Emmanuel Bamba (Finance Minister), and Alexandre Mahamba (Minister of Mines and Energy)\u2014was tried in May 1966, and sent to the gallows on 30 May, before an audience of 50,000 spectators. The men were executed on charges of being in contact with Colonel Alphonse Bangala and Major Pierre Efomi, for the purpose of planning a coup. Mobutu explained the executions as follows: \"One had to strike through a spectacular example, and create the conditions of regime discipline. When a chief takes a decision, he decides \u2013 period.\"<ref>Young and Turner, p. 57</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Pierre Mulele, Lumumba's Minister of Education and a rebel leader during the 1964 Simba Rebellion, was lured out of exile in [[Brazzaville]] on the belief that he would receive amnesty. Instead, he was tortured and killed by Mobutu's forces. While Mulele was still alive, his eyes were gouged out, his genitals were ripped off, and his limbs were amputated one by one.<ref>Wrong, Michela (2002).

He used the slogan \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer still\"<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-09-15-voa8/323431.html Influential Africans: Mobutu Sese Seko], [[Voice of America]], 31 October 2009</ref> to describe his tactic of co-opting political opponents through bribery. A favorite Mobutu tactic was to play \"musical chairs\", rotating members of his government, switching the cabinet roster constantly to ensure that no one would pose a threat to his rule. Another tactic was to arrest and sometimes torture dissident members of the government, only to later pardon them and reward them with high office.{{citation needed|date= September 2017}}\n\nIn 1972, Mobutu tried unsuccessfully to have himself named [[president for life]].<ref>Young and Turner, p. 211</ref> In May 1983 he raised himself to the rank of [[Marshal]];<ref>[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/19/Mobutu-grants-amnesty-to-political-prisoners-in-Zaire/5205422164800/ UPI, May 14 1983]</ref> the order was signed by General Likulia Bolongo.

But in many cases he handed the management of these firms to relatives and close associates, who quickly exercised their own corruption and stole the companies' assets. By 1977, this had precipitated such an economic slump that Mobutu was forced to try to woo foreign investors back.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1072684.stm BBC: \"Timeline: Democratic Republic of Congo\"].

The governments of Belgium and France deployed troops with logistical support from the United States and defeated the rebels again.\n\nMobutu was re-elected in single-candidate elections in [[1977 Zairean presidential election|1977]] and [[1984 Zairean presidential election|1984]].

By 1989, the government was forced to default on international loans from Belgium.\n\nMobutu owned a fleet of [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation's roads deteriorated and many of his people starved. The infrastructure virtually collapsed, and many public service workers went months without being paid. Most of the money was siphoned off to Mobutu, his family, and top political and military leaders. Only the [[Special Presidential Division]] \u2013 on whom his physical safety depended \u2013 was paid adequately or regularly.

Relations soured early in Mobutu's rule over disputes involving the substantial Belgian commercial and industrial holdings in the country, but relations warmed soon afterwards. Mobutu and his family were received as personal guests of the Belgian monarch in 1968, and a convention for scientific and technical cooperation was signed that same year. During [[King Baudouin]]'s highly successful visit to [[Kinshasa]] in 1970, a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries was signed.

Memories of Chinese aid to Mulele and other Maoist rebels in Kwilu province during the ill-fated [[Simba Rebellion]] remained fresh in Mobutu's mind. He also opposed seating the PRC at the United Nations. However, by 1972, he began to see the Chinese in a different light, as a counterbalance to both the Soviet Union as well as his intimate ties with the United States, [[Israel]], and South Africa.<ref name=\"callagy\">Callagy, Thomas M.

(1993) \"Zaire in the International Arena\" in ''Zaire: Continuity and Political Change in an Oppressive State''. [[Westview Press]]. {{ISBN|0-86531-298-2}}</ref> In November 1972, Mobutu extended diplomatic recognition to the Chinese (as well as [[East Germany]] and [[North Korea]]). The following year, Mobutu paid a visit to Beijing, where he met with chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and received promises of $100&nbsp;million in technical aid.\n\nIn 1974, Mobutu made a surprise visit to both China and North Korea, during the time he was originally scheduled to visit the Soviet Union. Upon returning home, both his politics and rhetoric became markedly more radical; it was around this time that Mobutu began criticizing Belgium and the United States (the latter for not doing enough, in Mobutu's opinion, to combat white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia), introduced the \"obligatory civic work\" program called ''salongo'', and initiated \"radicalization\" (an extension of 1973's \"Zairianization\" policy). Mobutu even borrowed a title \u2013 the Helmsman \u2013 from Mao. Incidentally, late 1974-early 1975 was when his personality cult reached its peak.\n\nChina and Zaire shared a common goal in central Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the FNLA (and later, UNITA) in order to prevent the [[MPLA]], who were supported and augmented by [[Military of Cuba|Cuban forces]], from coming to power. The Cubans, who exercised considerable influence in Africa in support of leftist and anti-imperialist forces, were heavily sponsored by the Soviet Union during the period. In addition to inviting Holden Roberto and his guerrillas to Beijing for training, China provided weapons and money to the rebels. Zaire itself launched an ill-fated, pre-emptive invasion of Angola in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government, but was repulsed by Cuban troops. The expedition was a fiasco with far-reaching repercussions, most notably the Shaba I and Shaba II invasions, both of which China opposed. China sent military aid to Zaire during both invasions, and accused the Soviet Union and Cuba (who were alleged to have supported the Shaban rebels, although this was and remains speculation) of working to de-stabilize central Africa.\n\n====Relations with the Soviet Union====\nMobutu's relationship with the Soviet Union was frosty and tense. A staunch anti-communist, he was not anxious to recognize the Soviets; the USSR had supported\u2014though mostly in words\u2014both Patrice Lumumba, Mobutu's democratically elected predecessor, and the Simba rebellion. However, to project a non-aligned image, he did renew ties in 1967; the first Soviet ambassador arrived and presented his credentials in 1968.<ref name=\"Kasuka 2012 p. 180\">{{cite book |last=Kasuka |first=B. |title=Prominent African Leaders Since Independence |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4700-4358-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ragu4v8r--4C&pg=PA180 |access-date=2018-02-17 |page=180}}</ref> Mobutu did, however, join the United States in condemning the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year.<ref name=\"Schatzberg1991\">{{cite book|author=Michael G.

This had a dramatic effect on Zairian foreign policy for the next decade; bereft of his claim to African leadership (Mobutu was one of the few leaders who refused to recognize the Marxist government of Angola), Mobutu turned increasingly to the US and its allies, adopting pro-American stances on such issues as the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and [[Israel]]'s position in international organizations.\n\n====Relations with the United States====\n[[File:Mobutu Nixon.gif|thumb|250px|Mobutu Sese Seko and [[Richard Nixon]] in Washington, D.C., October 1973]]\nFor the most part, Zaire enjoyed warm relations with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H.

During Reagan's presidency, Mobutu visited the [[White House]] three times, and criticism of Zaire's human rights record by the US was effectively muted.

He appointed a transitional government that would lead to promised elections but he retained substantial powers. Following riots in Kinshasa by unpaid soldiers, Mobutu brought opposition figures into a coalition government but he still connived to retain control of the security services and important ministries. Factional divisions led to the creation of two governments in 1993, one pro and one anti-Mobutu. The anti-Mobutu government was headed by [[Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya|Laurent Monsengwo]] and [[\u00c9tienne Tshisekedi]] of the [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Union for Democracy and Social Progress]]. The economic situation was still dreadful, and, in 1994, the two groups joined as the High Council of Republic \u2013 Parliament of Transition (HCR-PT). Mobutu appointed [[Kengo Wa Dondo]], an advocate of [[austerity]] and [[free-market]] reforms, as prime minister. Mobutu was becoming increasingly physically frail and during one of his absences for medical treatment in Europe, [[Tutsi]]s captured much of eastern Zaire.\n\n==Overthrow==\nWhen Mobutu's government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, the ethnic Tutsis in Zaire,<ref>Atzili, Boaz (2012) ''Good Fences, Bad Neighbors: Border Fixity and International Conflict''.

From eastern Zaire, the rebels, aided by foreign government forces under the leadership of President [[Yoweri Museveni]] of [[Uganda]] and Rwandan Minister of Defense [[Paul Kagame]] launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him under [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] as they marched west toward Kinshasa. Burundi and Angola also supported the growing rebellion, which mushroomed into the [[First Congo War]].\n\nAiling with cancer, Mobutu was in [[Switzerland]] for treatment,<ref>Dipiazza, Francesca Davis (2007) ''Democratic Republic of Congo in Pictures''.

On 16 May 1997, following failed peace talks held in [[Pointe-Noire]] on board the [[South African Navy]] ship [[SAS Outeniqua|SAS ''Outeniqua'']] with Kabila and President of South Africa [[Nelson Mandela]] (who chaired the talks), Mobutu fled into exile. Kabila's forces, known as the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (AFDL), proclaimed victory the next day. The AFDL would have completely overrun the country far sooner if not for the country's decrepit infrastructure.

Mobutu, wanting to expand his country's image and gain international recognition and legitimacy in the process, put up some of Zaire's money and hosted the televised world heavyweight championship bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Mobutu gained Zaire and its people considerable publicity in the weeks before the bout as worldwide attention focused on his country due to the bout. According to a quote in the film, Ali supposedly said: \"Some countries go to war to get their names out there, and wars cost a lot more than ten million (dollars).\" On September 22, 1974, Mobutu presented the rebuilt 20th of May Stadium, a multi million dollar sports project Zaire had undertaken to host the Ali-Foreman boxing card, to the Zaire Ministry of Youth and Sport, and to the people of Zaire.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Thomas A. |title=100,000 Cheers Greet Mobutu \u2018Gift,\u2019 a Rebuilt Stadium |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/23/archives/100000-cheers-greet-mobutu-gift-a-rebuilt-stadium.html |work=The New York Times |date=23 September 1974}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Notelist}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Books===\n====English====\n*Ayittey, George B.N.

He also served as [[Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity|Chairman]] of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] from 1967 to 1968. During the [[Congo Crisis]], Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of nationalist [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba's execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country's armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965 to become the country's [[military dictator]].\n\nTo consolidate his power, he established the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] as the [[One-party state|sole legal political party]] in 1967, changed the Congo's name to ''Zaire'' in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was \"neither left nor right, nor even centre\"<ref>Crawford Young, Thomas Edwin Turner, The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State, p. 210, 1985, University of Wisconsin Press</ref> but in practice he developed a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[totalitarian regime]], amassed vast personal wealth, and attempted to purge the country of all [[Colonization of the Congo|colonial cultural influence]] through his program of \"[[Authenticit\u00e9 (Zaire)|national authenticity]]\".

From 1972 onwards, he was also supported by [[Mao Zedong]] of [[China]], mainly due to his [[anti-Soviet]] stance, but also as part of Mao's attempts to create a bloc of Afro-Asian nations led by him; the massive Chinese economic aid that flowed into Zaire allowed Mobutu more flexibility in his dealings with Western governments, gave him the chance to portray himself as an \"anti-capitalist revolutionary\", and enabled him to avoid going to the [[International Monetary Fund]] for assistance.<ref>Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao: the Unknown Story, p. 574, 2006 edition, Anchor Books</ref>\n\nBy 1991, economic deterioration and unrest led him to agree to share power with opposition leaders, but he used the army to thwart change until May 1997, when rebel forces led by [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] expelled him from the country. Already suffering from advanced [[prostate cancer]], he died three months later in [[Morocco]]. Mobutu became notorious for [[Corruption in the Democratic Republic of the Congo#History|corruption]], [[nepotism]], and the [[embezzlement]] of between US$4&nbsp;billion and $15&nbsp;billion during his reign.

HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0061863610}}. pp. 70\u201372</ref> Thereafter he was raised by an uncle and a grandfather.<!-- from French wikipedia -->\n\nThe wife of the Belgian judge took a liking to Mobutu and taught him to speak, read, and write fluently in the French language. Yemo relied on the help of relatives to support her four children, and the family moved often. Mobutu's earliest education took place in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], but his mother eventually sent him to an uncle in [[Mbandaka|Coquilhatville]], where he attended the Christian Brothers School, a Catholic-mission boarding school. A physically imposing figure, Mobutu dominated school sports. He also excelled in academic subjects and ran the class newspaper. He was known for his pranks and impish sense of humor.\n\nA classmate recalled that when the Belgian priests, whose first language was Dutch, made an error in French, Mobutu would leap to his feet in class and point out the mistake. Mobutu stowed away aboard a boat to [[L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1949, where he met a girl. The priests found him several weeks later. At the end of the school year, in lieu of being sent to prison, he was ordered to serve seven years in the colonial army, the [[Force Publique]] (FP). This was the usual punishment for rebellious students.<ref>Wrong, pp. 72\u201374</ref>\n\n===Army service===\nMobutu found discipline in army life, as well as a father figure in Sergeant [[Louis Bobozo]]. Mobutu kept up his studies by borrowing European newspapers from the Belgian officers and books from wherever he could find them, reading them on sentry duty and whenever he had a spare moment. His favourites were the writings of French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]], and Italian Renaissance philosopher [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]. After passing a course in accounting, Mobutu began to dabble professionally in journalism. Still angry after his clashes with the school priests, he did not marry in a church. His contribution to the wedding festivities was a crate of beer, all his army salary could afford.<ref>Wrong, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n=== Early political involvement ===\nAs a soldier, Mobutu wrote pseudonymously on contemporary politics for ''Actualit\u00e9s Africaines'' (African News), a magazine set up by a Belgian colonial. In 1956, he quit the army and became a full-time journalist,<ref>Wrong, p. 75</ref> writing for the L\u00e9opoldville daily ''[[L'Avenir (newspaper)|L'Avenir]]''.<ref>Crawford Young and Thomas Turner, ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State'', p. 175</ref>\n\nTwo years later, he went to Belgium to cover the [[Expo '58|1958 World Exposition]] and stayed to receive training in journalism. By this time, Mobutu had met many of the young Congolese intellectuals who were challenging colonial rule. He became friendly with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and joined Lumumba's [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC). Mobutu eventually became Lumumba's personal aide. Several contemporaries indicate that Belgian intelligence had recruited Mobutu to be an informer to the government.<ref>Wrong, pp. 76</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960 talks in Brussels on Congolese independence, the US embassy held a reception for the Congolese delegation. Embassy staff were each assigned a list of delegation members to meet, and discussed their impressions afterward. The ambassador noted, \"One name kept coming up. But it wasn't on anyone's list because he wasn't an official delegation member, he was Lumumba's secretary. But everyone agreed that this was an extremely intelligent man, very young, perhaps immature, but a man with great potential.\"<ref>Wrong, p. 67</ref>\n\nFollowing the general election, Lumumba was tasked with creating a government. He gave Mobutu the office of Secretary of State to the Presidency. Mobutu held much influence in the final determination of the rest of the government.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=113}}\n\n===Congo Crisis===\n{{main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Colonel Mobutu.jpg|thumb|Colonel Mobutu in 1960]]\nOn 5 July 1960, soldiers of the Force Publique stationed at Camp L\u00e9opold II in L\u00e9opoldville, dissatisfied with their all-white leadership and working conditions, [[Mutiny of the Force Publique|mutinied]]. The revolt spread across the region in the following days. Mobutu assisted other officials in negotiating with the mutineers to secure the release of the officers and their families.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=88\u201389}} On 8 July the full Council of Ministers convened in an extraordinary session under the chairmanship of President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] at Camp L\u00e9opold II to address the task of Africanising the garrison.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=191}}\n\nAfter allowing for the election of a new commandant for the garrison, the ministers debated over who would make a suitable army chief of staff. The two main candidates for the post were [[Maurice Mpolo]] and Mobutu. The former had shown some influence over the mutinying troops, but Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers feared that he would enact a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' if he were given power. The latter was perceived as calmer and more thoughtful.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=192}} Lumumba saw Mpolo as courageous, but favored Mobutu's prudence. As the discussions continued, the cabinet began to divide according to who they preferred to serve as chief of staff. Lumumba wanted to keep both men in his government and wished to avoid upsetting one of their camps of supporters.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=192}} In the end Mobutu was given the role and awarded the rank of colonel.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=193}} The following day government delegations left the capital to oversee the Africanisation of the army; Mobutu was sent to \u00c9quateur.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=92, 94}}\n\nEncouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Concerned that the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|United Nations force]] sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union]] for assistance. He received massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers within six weeks. As this was during the [[Cold War]], the US government feared that the Soviet activity was a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasa-Vubu was encouraged by the US and Belgium to dismiss Lumumba, which he did on 5 September. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasa-Vubu deposed. Parliament refused to recognise the dismissals and urged reconciliation, but no agreement was reached.\n\nLumumba and Kasa-Vubu each ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers' salaries, as well as Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu's subordinates, all favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On 14 September Mobutu launched a bloodless coup, declaring both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to be \"neutralised\" and establishing a new government of university graduates, the [[College of Commissioners-General]]. Lumumba rejected this action but was forced to retire to his residence, where UN peacekeepers prevented Mobutu's soldiers from arresting him.\n\nLosing confidence that the international community would support his reinstatement, Lumumba fled in late November to join his supporters in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] to establish a [[Free Republic of the Congo|new government]]. He was captured by Mobutu's troops in early December, and incarcerated at his headquarters in Thysville. However, Mobutu still considered him a threat, and transferred him to the rebelling [[State of Katanga]] on 17 January 1961. Lumumba disappeared from public view. It was later discovered that he was murdered the same day by the secessionist forces of [[Moise Tshombe]], after Mobutu's government turned him over.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Elizabeth|title=Foreign Intervention in Africa|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mobutu and Kasa-Vubu in 1961.jpg|thumb|Colonel Joseph-Desir\u00e9 Mobutu (left) with President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, 1961|left]]\nOn 23 January 1961, Kasa-Vubu promoted Mobutu to major-general.

However, Parliament twice refused to confirm him. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup on 25 November.{{contradict-inline|reason=Infobox says November 24}} He had turned 35 a month earlier.<ref name=cs1>{{csref|country=zaire|author=Lemarchand, Ren\u00e9 |section=Mobutu's Second Coming}}</ref>\n\nUnder the auspices of a ''regime d'exception'' (the equivalent of a [[state of emergency]]), Mobutu assumed sweeping\u2014almost absolute\u2014powers for five years.<ref name=cs2>{{csref|country=zaire|author=Turner, Thomas |section=The Party-State as a System of Rule}}</ref> In his first speech upon taking power, Mobutu told a large crowd at L\u00e9opoldville's main stadium that, since politicians had brought the country to ruin in five years, it would take him at least that long to set things right again. Therefore, he announced, \"for five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country.\"<ref name=Anatomy/> Parliament was reduced to a rubber stamp before being abolished altogether, but it was later revived. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralized state.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Katoenen overhemd met portret van Mobutu TMnr 5829-1.jpg|thumb|A Congolese cotton shirt embellished with a portrait of Mobutu from the collection of the [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam]]\nInitially, Mobutu's government was decidedly apolitical, even anti-political. The word \"politician\" carried negative connotations, and became almost synonymous with someone who was wicked or corrupt. In 1966 the Corps of Volunteers of the Republic was established, a vanguard movement designed to mobilize popular support behind Mobutu, who was proclaimed the nation's \"Second National Hero\" after Lumumba. Despite the role he played in Lumumba's ouster, Mobutu worked to present himself as a successor to Lumumba's legacy. One of his key tenets early in his rule was \"authentic Congolese nationalism\".\n\n1967 marked the debut of the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party. Among the themes advanced by the MPR in its doctrine, the Manifesto of N'Sele, were nationalism, revolution, and \"authenticity\". Revolution was described as a \"truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic\", which called for \"the repudiation of both capitalism and communism\". One of the MPR's slogans was \"Neither left nor right\", to which would be added \"nor even center\" in later years.\n\nThat same year, all trade unions were consolidated into a single union, the National Union of Zairian Workers, and brought under government control. Mobutu intended for the union to serve as an instrument of support for government policy, rather than as an independent group. Independent trade unions were illegal until 1991.\n\n[[File:Mobutu swearing in, 1970.jpg|thumb|Mobutu sworn in as President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo following the 1970 election]]\nFacing many challenges early in his rule, Mobutu converted much opposition into submission through patronage; those he could not co-opt, he dealt with forcefully. In 1966, four cabinet members were arrested on charges of complicity in an attempted coup, tried by a military tribunal, and publicly executed in an open-air spectacle witnessed by over 50,000 people. Uprisings by former Katangan gendarmeries were crushed, as were the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] of 1967 led by white mercenaries.<ref>Anthony Mockler, 'The New Mercenaries,' Corgi Books, 1985, {{ISBN|0-552-12558-X}}.</ref> By 1970, nearly all potential threats to his authority had been smashed, and for the most part, law and order was brought to nearly all parts of the country. That year marked the pinnacle of Mobutu's legitimacy and power.\n\nIn 1970 [[Majesty|His Majesty]] [[Baudouin of the Belgians|King Baudouin of the Belgians]] made a highly successful state visit to [[Kinshasa]]. That same year [[1970 Democratic Republic of the Congo parliamentary election|legislative]] and [[1970 Democratic Republic of the Congo presidential election|presidential elections]] were held. The MPR was the only party allowed to run, although the constitution stated that at least two parties were authorized. According to official figures, an implausible 98.33% of voters voted in favor of the MPR list. For the presidential election, Mobutu was the only candidate. Voting was not secret; voters chose a green paper if they supported Mobutu's candidacy, and a red paper if they opposed his candidacy. Casting a green ballot was deemed a vote for hope, while a red ballot was deemed a vote for chaos. Under the circumstances, the result was inevitable\u2013Mobutu won with a vote of 10,131,669 to 157.<ref>Callaghy, Thomas M. ''The State-Society Struggle: Zaire in Comparative Perspective'', p. 164</ref> It later emerged that almost 30,500 more votes were cast than the actual number of registered voters.<ref name=EISA>[http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/drcsecondrepublic.htm DRC: Elections under the Second Republic] EISA</ref><ref>Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p294 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref>\n\nAs he consolidated power, Mobutu set up several military forces whose sole purpose was to protect him. These included the [[Special Presidential Division]], Civil Guard and Service for Action, and Military Intelligence (SNIP).\n\n===Authenticity campaign===\n{{main|Authenticit\u00e9 (Zaire)}}\n[[File:Flag of Zaire.svg|left|Flag of Zaire|thumb]]\n\nEmbarking on a campaign of pro-Africa cultural awareness, or ''[[authenticit\u00e9 (Zaire)|authenticit\u00e9]]'', Mobutu began renaming cities that reflected the colonial past, starting on 1 June 1966: Leopoldville became Kinshasa, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Stanleyville became Kisangani. In October 1971, he renamed the country as the [[Republic of Zaire]]. He ordered the people to change their European names to African ones, and priests were warned that they would face five years' imprisonment if they were caught [[Baptism|baptizing]] a Zairian child with a European name. Western attire and ties were banned, and men were forced to wear a [[Mao suit|Mao-style tunic]] known as an ''[[abacost]]'' (shorthand for ''\u00e0 bas le costume'', or \"down with the suit\").<ref>Shaw 2005, 63.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, in accordance with his own decree of a year earlier, Mobutu renamed himself ''Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga'' ( meaning \"The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.\"),<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w1V1AAAAMAAJ&q=%22The+warrior+who+knows+no+defeat+because+of+his+endurance+and+inflexible+will+and+is+all+powerful,+leaving+fire+in+his+wake+as+he+goes+from+conquest+to+conquest%22&dq=%22The+warrior+who+knows+no+defeat+because+of+his+endurance+and+inflexible+will+and+is+all+powerful,+leaving+fire+in+his+wake+as+he+goes+from+conquest+to+conquest%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv-7qpzOvWAhUCWBoKHcHeBaYQ6AEISzAG ''Zaire: Continuity and Political Change in an Oppressive State''], Winsome J.

Around this time, he eschewed his military uniform in favor of what would become his classic image\u2014the tall, imposing man wearing an abacost, thick-framed glasses, and leopard-skin [[toque]], and carrying a walking stick.\n\nIn 1974, a [[Constitution of Zaire|new constitution]] consolidated Mobutu's grip on the country. It defined the MPR as the \"single institution\" in the country. It was officially defined as \"the nation politically organized\"\u2014in essence, the state was a transmission belt for the party. All citizens automatically became members of the MPR from birth. The constitution stated that the MPR was embodied by the party's president, who was elected every seven years at its national convention. At the same time, the party president was automatically nominated as the sole candidate for a seven-year term as president of the republic; he was confirmed in office by a referendum.  The document vested the party president\u2013Mobutu\u2013with \"plentitude of power exercise,\" effectively codifying the dictatorial powers that Mobutu had exercised since 1965. A single list of MPR candidates was returned to the legislature every five years. For all intents and purposes, the Constitution placed all governing power in Mobutu's hands.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==One-man rule==\n[[File:Prince Bernhard and Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|270px|thumb|Mobutu Sese Seko with the Dutch [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]] in 1973]]\n\nEarly in his rule, Mobutu consolidated power by publicly executing political rivals, secessionists, coup plotters, and other threats to his rule. To set an example, many were [[hanging|hanged]] before large audiences. Such victims included former Prime Minister [[Evariste Kimba]], who, with three cabinet members\u2014J\u00e9r\u00f4me Anany (Defense Minister), Emmanuel Bamba (Finance Minister), and Alexandre Mahamba (Minister of Mines and Energy)\u2014was tried in May 1966, and sent to the gallows on 30 May, before an audience of 50,000 spectators. The men were executed on charges of being in contact with Colonel Alphonse Bangala and Major Pierre Efomi, for the purpose of planning a coup. Mobutu explained the executions as follows: \"One had to strike through a spectacular example, and create the conditions of regime discipline. When a chief takes a decision, he decides \u2013 period.\"<ref>Young and Turner, p. 57</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Pierre Mulele, Lumumba's Minister of Education and a rebel leader during the 1964 Simba Rebellion, was lured out of exile in [[Brazzaville]] on the belief that he would receive amnesty. Instead, he was tortured and killed by Mobutu's forces. While Mulele was still alive, his eyes were gouged out, his genitals were ripped off, and his limbs were amputated one by one.<ref>Wrong, Michela (2002).

Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-093443-3}}. p. 90</ref>\n\nMobutu later gave up torture and murder, and switched to a new tactic, buying off political rivals. He used the slogan \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer still\"<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-09-15-voa8/323431.html Influential Africans: Mobutu Sese Seko], [[Voice of America]], 31 October 2009</ref> to describe his tactic of co-opting political opponents through bribery. A favorite Mobutu tactic was to play \"musical chairs\", rotating members of his government, switching the cabinet roster constantly to ensure that no one would pose a threat to his rule. Another tactic was to arrest and sometimes torture dissident members of the government, only to later pardon them and reward them with high office.{{citation needed|date= September 2017}}\n\nIn 1972, Mobutu tried unsuccessfully to have himself named [[president for life]].<ref>Young and Turner, p. 211</ref> In May 1983 he raised himself to the rank of [[Marshal]];<ref>[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/19/Mobutu-grants-amnesty-to-political-prisoners-in-Zaire/5205422164800/ UPI, May 14 1983]</ref> the order was signed by General Likulia Bolongo. [[Victor Nendaka Bika]], in his capacity as Vice-President of the Bureau of the Central Committee, second authority in the land, addressed a speech filled with praise for President Mobutu.\n\nTo gain the revenues of Congolese resources, Mobutu initially [[nationalization|nationalized]] foreign-owned firms and forced European investors out of the country. But in many cases he handed the management of these firms to relatives and close associates, who quickly exercised their own corruption and stole the companies' assets. By 1977, this had precipitated such an economic slump that Mobutu was forced to try to woo foreign investors back.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1072684.stm BBC: \"Timeline: Democratic Republic of Congo\"].

The governments of Belgium and France deployed troops with logistical support from the United States and defeated the rebels again.\n\nMobutu was re-elected in single-candidate elections in [[1977 Zairean presidential election|1977]] and [[1984 Zairean presidential election|1984]]. He spent most of his time increasing his personal fortune, which in 1984 was estimated to amount to US$5&nbsp;billion.<ref>''Fortune'', 12 October 1987, p. 189</ref><ref>''[[60 Minutes]]'', 4 March 1984</ref> He held most of it out of the country in [[Swiss banking|Swiss banks]] (however, a comparatively small $3.4&nbsp;million was declared found in Swiss banks after he was ousted.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9706/03/mobutu/ \"Swiss banks find only $3.4 million in Mobutu assets\"].

By 1989, the government was forced to default on international loans from Belgium.\n\nMobutu owned a fleet of [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation's roads deteriorated and many of his people starved. The infrastructure virtually collapsed, and many public service workers went months without being paid. Most of the money was siphoned off to Mobutu, his family, and top political and military leaders. Only the [[Special Presidential Division]] \u2013 on whom his physical safety depended \u2013 was paid adequately or regularly. A popular saying that \"the civil servants pretended to work while the state pretended to pay them\" expressed this grim reality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/903324.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} AFRICA {{!}} Mobutu's legacy: Show over substance|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature of Mobutu's economic mismanagement, directly linked to the way he and his friends siphoned off so much of the country's wealth, was rampant inflation.

The following year, Mobutu paid a visit to Beijing, where he met with chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and received promises of $100&nbsp;million in technical aid.\n\nIn 1974, Mobutu made a surprise visit to both China and North Korea, during the time he was originally scheduled to visit the Soviet Union. Upon returning home, both his politics and rhetoric became markedly more radical; it was around this time that Mobutu began criticizing Belgium and the United States (the latter for not doing enough, in Mobutu's opinion, to combat white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia), introduced the \"obligatory civic work\" program called ''salongo'', and initiated \"radicalization\" (an extension of 1973's \"Zairianization\" policy). Mobutu even borrowed a title \u2013 the Helmsman \u2013 from Mao. Incidentally, late 1974-early 1975 was when his personality cult reached its peak.\n\nChina and Zaire shared a common goal in central Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the FNLA (and later, UNITA) in order to prevent the [[MPLA]], who were supported and augmented by [[Military of Cuba|Cuban forces]], from coming to power. The Cubans, who exercised considerable influence in Africa in support of leftist and anti-imperialist forces, were heavily sponsored by the Soviet Union during the period. In addition to inviting Holden Roberto and his guerrillas to Beijing for training, China provided weapons and money to the rebels. Zaire itself launched an ill-fated, pre-emptive invasion of Angola in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government, but was repulsed by Cuban troops. The expedition was a fiasco with far-reaching repercussions, most notably the Shaba I and Shaba II invasions, both of which China opposed. China sent military aid to Zaire during both invasions, and accused the Soviet Union and Cuba (who were alleged to have supported the Shaban rebels, although this was and remains speculation) of working to de-stabilize central Africa.\n\n====Relations with the Soviet Union====\nMobutu's relationship with the Soviet Union was frosty and tense. A staunch anti-communist, he was not anxious to recognize the Soviets; the USSR had supported\u2014though mostly in words\u2014both Patrice Lumumba, Mobutu's democratically elected predecessor, and the Simba rebellion. However, to project a non-aligned image, he did renew ties in 1967; the first Soviet ambassador arrived and presented his credentials in 1968.<ref name=\"Kasuka 2012 p. 180\">{{cite book |last=Kasuka |first=B. |title=Prominent African Leaders Since Independence |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4700-4358-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ragu4v8r--4C&pg=PA180 |access-date=2018-02-17 |page=180}}</ref> Mobutu did, however, join the United States in condemning the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year.<ref name=\"Schatzberg1991\">{{cite book|author=Michael G.

For example, in 1970, he expelled four Soviet diplomats for carrying out \"subversive activities\", and in 1971, twenty Soviet officials were declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' for allegedly instigating student demonstrations at [[Lovanium University]].<ref name=\"Kisangani2016\">{{cite book |author=Emizet Francois Kisangani |title=Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sj9mDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA538 |date=18 November 2016 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-1-4422-7316-0 |pages=538\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Moscow]] was the only major world capital Mobutu never visited, although he did accept an invitation to do so in 1974.

This had a dramatic effect on Zairian foreign policy for the next decade; bereft of his claim to African leadership (Mobutu was one of the few leaders who refused to recognize the Marxist government of Angola), Mobutu turned increasingly to the US and its allies, adopting pro-American stances on such issues as the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and [[Israel]]'s position in international organizations.\n\n====Relations with the United States====\n[[File:Mobutu Nixon.gif|thumb|250px|Mobutu Sese Seko and [[Richard Nixon]] in Washington, D.C., October 1973]]\nFor the most part, Zaire enjoyed warm relations with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Relations did cool significantly in 1974\u20131975 over Mobutu's increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations of American foreign policy),<ref name=\"Young and Turner, p. 372\">Young and Turner, p. 372</ref> and plummeted to an all-time low in the summer of 1975, when Mobutu accused the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (''in absentia'') a former head of the Central Bank ([[Albert Ndele]]).<ref name=\"Young and Turner, p. 372\"/> However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu's staunchest critics, Nzongola-Ntalaja, speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule.<ref>Elliot and Dymally, p. 150</ref> In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries found each other supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War.\n\nBecause of Mobutu's poor human rights record, the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] put some distance between itself and the [[Kinshasa]] government;<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0172) '&#39;Zaire: A Country Study'&#39;, \"Relations with the United States\"].

But during the second Shaba invasion, the US played a much more active and decisive role by providing transportation and logistical support to the French and Belgian paratroopers that were deployed to aid Mobutu against the rebels. Carter echoed Mobutu's (unsubstantiated) charges of Soviet and Cuban aid to the rebels, until it was apparent that no hard evidence existed to verify his claims.<ref>Young and Turner, p. 389</ref> In 1980, the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] voted to terminate military aid to Zaire, but the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] reinstated the funds, in response to pressure from Carter and American business interests in Zaire.<ref>Elliot and Dymally, p. 88</ref>\n\nMobutu enjoyed a very warm relationship with the [[Reagan Administration]], through financial donations. During Reagan's presidency, Mobutu visited the [[White House]] three times, and criticism of Zaire's human rights record by the US was effectively muted. During a state visit by Mobutu in 1983, Reagan praised the Zairian strongman as \"a voice of good sense and goodwill\".<ref>[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/05.22.97/cover/mobutu-9721.html \"When He Was King: On the trail of Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's former Kleptocrat-in-Chief\"].

With the [[Soviet Union]] gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: \"I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US.

He appointed a transitional government that would lead to promised elections but he retained substantial powers. Following riots in Kinshasa by unpaid soldiers, Mobutu brought opposition figures into a coalition government but he still connived to retain control of the security services and important ministries. Factional divisions led to the creation of two governments in 1993, one pro and one anti-Mobutu. The anti-Mobutu government was headed by [[Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya|Laurent Monsengwo]] and [[\u00c9tienne Tshisekedi]] of the [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Union for Democracy and Social Progress]]. The economic situation was still dreadful, and, in 1994, the two groups joined as the High Council of Republic \u2013 Parliament of Transition (HCR-PT). Mobutu appointed [[Kengo Wa Dondo]], an advocate of [[austerity]] and [[free-market]] reforms, as prime minister. Mobutu was becoming increasingly physically frail and during one of his absences for medical treatment in Europe, [[Tutsi]]s captured much of eastern Zaire.\n\n==Overthrow==\nWhen Mobutu's government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, the ethnic Tutsis in Zaire,<ref>Atzili, Boaz (2012) ''Good Fences, Bad Neighbors: Border Fixity and International Conflict''. University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226031365}} p. 188</ref> known as [[Banyamulenge]], were the focal point of a rebellion. From eastern Zaire, the rebels, aided by foreign government forces under the leadership of President [[Yoweri Museveni]] of [[Uganda]] and Rwandan Minister of Defense [[Paul Kagame]] launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him under [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] as they marched west toward Kinshasa. Burundi and Angola also supported the growing rebellion, which mushroomed into the [[First Congo War]].\n\nAiling with cancer, Mobutu was in [[Switzerland]] for treatment,<ref>Dipiazza, Francesca Davis (2007) ''Democratic Republic of Congo in Pictures''. Twenty First Century Books. {{ISBN|0822585723}}. p. 35</ref> and he was unable to coordinate the resistance which crumbled in front of the march.\n\nBy mid-1997, Kabila's forces resumed their advance, and the remains of Mobutu's army offered almost no resistance. On 16 May 1997, following failed peace talks held in [[Pointe-Noire]] on board the [[South African Navy]] ship [[SAS Outeniqua|SAS ''Outeniqua'']] with Kabila and President of South Africa [[Nelson Mandela]] (who chaired the talks), Mobutu fled into exile. Kabila's forces, known as the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (AFDL), proclaimed victory the next day. The AFDL would have completely overrun the country far sooner if not for the country's decrepit infrastructure. In most areas, no paved roads existed; the only vehicle paths were irregularly used dirt roads.

Mobutu was also featured in the feature film ''[[Lumumba (film)|Lumumba]]'', directed by [[Raoul Peck]], which detailed the pre-coup and coup years from the perspective of Lumumba.  Mobutu featured in the documentary ''[[When We Were Kings]]'', which centred around the famed ''[[Rumble in the Jungle]]'' boxing bout between [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]] for the 1974 [[heavyweight]] championship of the world. The bout took place in [[Kinshasa]] during Mobutu's rule.  Mobutu also might be considered as the inspiration behind some of the characters in the works of the poetry of [[Wole Soyinka]], the novel ''[[A Bend in the River]]'' by [[V. S. Naipaul]], and ''[[Anthills of the Savannah]]'' by [[Chinua Achebe]]. [[William Close]], father of actress [[Glenn Close]], was once a personal physician to Mobutu and wrote a book focusing on his service in Zaire.

According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$4\u20135&nbsp;billion from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$15&nbsp;billion. According to Mobutu's ex-son-in-law, Pierre Janssen\u2014the ex-husband of Mobutu's daughter Yaki\u2014Mobutu had no concern for the cost of the expensive gifts he gave away to his cronies. Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 wedding cake and a giant fireworks display.

Mobutu, wanting to expand his country's image and gain international recognition and legitimacy in the process, put up some of Zaire's money and hosted the televised world heavyweight championship bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Mobutu gained Zaire and its people considerable publicity in the weeks before the bout as worldwide attention focused on his country due to the bout.

Tensions in the region were high during the early twentieth century. The [[Ottomans]] were in retreat everywhere, the newly independent nations of the [[Balkans]] were united against them, and [[Italy]] had in 1911 declared war, seizing [[Libya]]. In 1912, the Italians swept the Aegean of Ottoman warships and seized [[Rhodes]]. The inhabitants of Icaria took advantage of the war to declare themselves independent on 12 July 1912. The Balkan alliance declared war in July, reducing the Ottoman holdings in Europe to a tiny foothold.
