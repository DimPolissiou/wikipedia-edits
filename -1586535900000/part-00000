Many of spriteCloud's earliest clients were digital agencies that required testing for the various websites and online assets they created as part of ad campaigns for their clients. In the beginning, spriteCloud offered functional/manual testing and test automation, but this later grew into the full services offering. <br />\n== Services and Products ==\n\n=== Testing Services ===\nspriteCloud's testing services revolve around providing testing how the customer needs it. This means that each testing services can be mixed-and-matched and delivered in several ways to suit the client's needs. \n\n<br />\n\n=====[[Functional testing|Functional/manual testing]]=====\nFunctional/manual testing is often a manual process where testers test ''what'' the application does and evaluate it against what the application is supposed according to its functional requirements. These tests involve many types like [[Regression testing]], [[Usability testing]], [[Smoke testing (software)|Smoke testing]], and [[Sanity testing]].\n\n=====[[Penetration test|Security and penetration testing]]=====\nSecurity and penetration testing is a recent addition to spriteCloud's testing services portfolio. The security and penetration tests available from spriteCloud are vulnerability scanning, cyber threat intelligence assessments (OSINT), web application penetration tests, mobile application penetration tests, wireless network penetration tests, and infrastructure penetration tests. \n\n=====[[Automated testing|Test Automation]]=====\nTest automation is an essential part of modern software development as it automates a lot of menial testing processes. Test automation is needed for adopting certain software development methodologies like DevOps and for working in CI/CD and continue testing practices. \n\n=====[[Load testing|Performance and Load Testing]]=====\nThis form of testing focuses on testing systems to see how they can able various loads of users to find how they affect system performance, max loads, and how they behave under stress. These types of tests are particularly useful for applications or websites with many concurrent users, like webshops and streaming services.<br />\n=== Delivery Methods ===\nAs of April 2020, spriteCloud is able to offer clients software testing services executed via the following delivery methods.<br />\n\n==== Company Placement ====\nIn a company placement engagement, a spriteCloud test engineer is contracted out, or [[Secondment|seconded]], to an organisation that requires specialised knowledge or temporary software testing support. During these placements, testers join the quality assurance or development team for a period ranging from one month or up to two years. These engagements are best for clients that want a (near) full-time tester but don't want the liability of a full-time permanent staff member.  \n\n==== Remote Testing ====\nspriteCloud's software testers and test automation engineers can provide testing services for the client's development team members remotely. This means that spriteCloud's testers have practice operating under remote working policies and are fully capable of delivering the standard level for testing quality without being physically located at the client's premises. spriteCloud can also offer remote testing with a reduced rate by remotely testing from its office in Kiev, making using of [[Global labor arbitrage|labour arbitrage]].\n\n==== Software Testing Subscription ====\nUsing a subscription model to offer consistent and integrated testing in a single custom package, spriteCloud's Software Testing Subscription is useful for organisations with a regular need for testing that changes over time. A unique testing services package is created along with the help of a spriteCloud business development manager to match organisation's requirements around test automation, cybersecurity, performance and load testing, and functional/manual testing. Price reductions are given based on the number of testing services added to the package and the overall length of the subscription. \n\n==== Ad Hoc Testing ====\nspriteCloud's Ad Hoc testing delivery method is the standard project engagement. The scope and duration of the project is agreed on, and testing resources are dedicated to the client's project based on those requirements. <br />\n=== Products ===\n\n====[https://www.calliope.pro Calliope Pro]====\nCalliope Pro is a test results dashboard that was created to help software development and software testing teams collaborate more effectively. By uploading test results data, as a JSON or XML file, Calliope Pro allows a team to store all test results data in one location, for all to access at their convenience. In this dashboard, teams can visualise test results over time, edit report data, integrate the Calliope app in their CI/CD pipelines, and set up API calls. Calliope Pro allows development team members to easily monitor the health or quality of code in different environments (like test, staging, and production environments). Teams can easily see when regressions were introduced into test data and with this information quickly fix these issues.\n\nCalliope Pro supports most major software testing tools and frameworks such as Cucumber, Serenity, TestCafe, JUnit, TestNG, and XUnit.\n\n<br />\n\n== Identity ==\n\n=== Logo ===\nspriteCloud's logo is simply \"spriteCloud\" in a stylized font with \"sprite\" and \"Cloud\" differentiated by two of spriteCloud's company colours.

The goal of spriteCloud is to help ensure that applications are fully tested before release, so these potentially reputation ruining bugs are mitigated. The tagline also reflects the relationship between spriteCloud's early clients, digital agencies, and those client's own customers.

{"title_page": "Turffontein Reformed Church", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Turffontein Reformed Church''' was a congregation of the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)]] in southern [[Johannesburg]], [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]]. It was founded in 1906 and for years had a large membership, at times exceeding 3,000.\n\n88 years after its foundation and 44 years after that of the [[Johannesburg South Reformed Church (NGK)]], however, the two congregations would merge to form the Deo Gloria Reformed Church on April 24, 1994. This was due in part to the emigration of [[Afrikaners]] toward more affluent neighborhoods as well as the burning down of the neglected Turffontein Church, which the congregation could not afford to rebuild, in March 1992. The merger ended the oldest congregation in southern downtown Johannesburg, from which sprang all others in the area.\n\n== Background ==\nWhen the [[Johannesburg East Reformed Church (NGK)]] and the [[Jeppestown Reformed Church]] seceded from the oldest NGK church on the Rand, the [[Johannesburg Reformed Church (NGK)]], on July 8, 1897, Casey's Town (later known as [[Turffontein]]) became part of the Jeppestown congregation. Even before then, Johannesburg pastors Rev. J.N. Martins and [[Pieter Gerhardus Jacobus Meiring]] held services in a small meeting hall in Casey's Town. Serving the southern areas of Jeppestown proved especially challenging, since Rev. [[Paul Nel]] could only spare two Sundays a month to preach there. The Rev. Meiring (since then having moved to the [[Johannesburg East Reformed Church (NGK)]]) and Rev. Dani\u00ebl Theron of the [[Fordsburg Reformed Church]] helped out at first, but had to be replaced by a missionary, brother MacLean, who himself remained there only a few months.\n\n== Turffontein church hall ==\nThe Jeppestown congregation building committee, on the recommendation of the church council, decided in June 1903 to replace the cramped, dilapidated local meeting hall with a new building and rent out the old one to schools after renovation. Several months later, T.D. Hannecke won the \u00a31,509 bid for construction, and on Saturday, July 30, 1904, Rev. Meiring laid the cornerstone. Speaking of the occasion, Rev. Nel said \u201cthat it will not be long before an independent congregation would be founded in Turffontein\u201d (quoted in the August 1904 issue of the Transvaal NGK magazine ''De Vereeniging''). It is not clear exactly when the building was finished and inaugurated.\n\nHannecke's work was clearly done by mid-November, when the council decided at its meeting to wait to dedicate the building until after it was furnished. That August, the Jeppestown council accepted a separate \u00a3400 bid for furniture and a pulpit from the Van Hoogstraten brothers. Whatever delayed delivery and thus the opening, the church was in operation before 1904 was out.\n\n== Leadup to secession ==\nThe August 26, 1903 issue of ''De Vereeniging'' told of the need for a new congregation to serve the suburbs south of the \u201cReef\u201d (the main gold vein). Of these, [[Ophirton]] and [[Booysens (Johannesburg)|Booysens]] were part of Johannesburg East, and Turffontein and [[La Rochelle, Gauteng|La Rochelle]] belonged to Jeppestown. The two congregations agreed to hire a curate to prepare the area for secession, an idea endorsed by both Dr. [[Hendrik Adriaan Lamprecht]] (Rev. Meiring's successor at Johannesburg East) and Rev. Nel at the August 1905 Jeppestown council meeting. The two congregations requested and received the help of Rev. J.D. de Villiers, at the time a curate for Jeppestown, to handle the task.\n\nFor a little over two months, Rev. De Villiers worked among the members in the southern suburbs, some of whom submitted petitions for secession to their respective councils. In Early October 1905, the Ophirton and Booysens wards resolved at congregation meetings to submit secession petitions to the Johannesburg East council, which adopted by unanimous vote on the 10th the following motion: \u201cthe church council takes great notice of the meeting in Ophirton and the decision taken there, and is willing to entertain the request provided legal requirements are met.\u201d\n\nThe Turffontein ward members came to this conclusion as well around the same time. Within a week of Johannesburg East's above reply, Turffontein petitioned the Jeppestown council, asking \u201cfor the founding of a new church south of the Reef and funds to build a parsonage and maintain public services,\u201d according to the council meeting notes. The council referred the issue to the Ring but declined to provide the money until similar contributions could be obtained from Johannesburg East.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Rev. Nel and two of the Jeppestown elders attended the Johannesburg East council meeting. After they pledged to deed property worth \u00a33,800 to the new congregation, namely several plots of land in Turffontein and La Rochelle where the local church halls were, the Johannesburg East council granted property worth \u00a31,600 in Ophirton and a stipend of \u00a3250 a year for the first four years. Thus, the new congregation would start with three halls (including a new and well-furnished one in Turffontein) and \u00a31,000 in seed money.\n\n== Secession ==\nWith the foundation thus set, the [[Potchefstroom]] Ring Committee met on the morning of Wednesday, February 28, 1906 in the Turffontein church to officially declare the secession. That night, a congregation meeting elected the first council members in the same building. Two weeks later, the March 8 ''De Vereeniging'' reported  on the foundation of \u201ca new congregation south of the Reef, named the La Rochelle Dutch Reformed Church.\u201d The reported announced that a Jeppestown representative would serve as consulent and clarified the new congregation's boundaries.\n\n== Etymology of La Rochelle ==\nIts name would spring from the local suburb of La Rochelle, which Ring Committee member Rev. Louw of [[Heidelberg, Gauteng|Heidelberg]] compared to \u201cThe Rock [[Christ]].\u201d The name of the suburb, of course, came from [[La Rochelle]], [[France]], the last fortress of the [[Huguenots]] of whom so many came to South Africa.\n\n== Early years ==\nThe congregation's first pastor were Revs. C.F. Mynhardt (1907\u201310) and S.W. van Niekerk (1911\u201321). The third, Rev. T.A. Broodrijk, was invested on October 29, 1921, and under him the parsonage was built and the congregation decided to build a church, which would be dedicated on September 4, 1925, though the organ would not be used until September 3, 1927. A 1929 [[tornado]] destroyed the hall alongside the new church, which would be replaced by a new one that opened in May 1930. The Rev. Broodrijk was assisted by proponent J.H. van Loggerenberg from December 1929 to September 1930. On May 17, 1932, the pastor reported to the council that all debts were paid, but he died on August 17 and would be buried in the churchyard. His wife and two children left the area on December 4, 1932, his gravestone emblazoned with the words \u201che did what he could.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. T.C. Esterhuysen served for the first nine months after Rev. Broodryk's death. Meanwhile, the council saw the need for further secession and therefore bought eight plots worth \u00a31,600 in [[Rosettenville]]. \u00a311,000 had been raised over the 11 years leading up to 1932 for the purpose.\n\n== La Rochelle becomes Turffontein ==\nRev. A.H. Stander (May 1933-April 1948) and J. de Jager (1948\u201358) saw tenures marked by heavy secessions. In 1938, the [[Rosettenville Reformed Church]] seceded, prompting the mother church to be renamed to Turffontein given La Rochelle belonging to the new Rosettenville territory. In August 1947, another congregation seceded, the [[Forest Hill Reformed Church]].\n\nWithin the first year of the Rev. and Mrs. De Jager's arrival as the fifth pastoral couple in the congregation, the Reverend warned the council of yet more departures. The secession of the [[Johannesburg South Reformed Church (NGK)]], officially finalized on November 15, 1950 in the Booysens police station cafeteria, was the third in eleven years and left Turffontein an urban congregation with around 980 members. \u00a33,000 in endowments were raised within a short time to improve Johannesburg South's buildings.\n\n== Merger with Johannesburg South ==\nAn additional factor in the April 24, 1994 merger with Johannesburg South as Deo Gloria, besides the March 1992 fire that destroyed Turffontein's church, was the retirement of Rev. J.L. Coetzee, second and final pastor of Johannesburg South from 1955 to 1994. According to the final NGK Yearbook, Turffontein in 1994 had 90 baptized members and 346 confirmed ones while Johannesburg South had respective figures of 62 and 252. The Johannesburg South church on the corner of Alamein and Faunce Roads in [[Robertsham]] is home to Deo Gloria, whose 58 baptized and 367 confirmed members of 2010 have been served by Rev. A.D.P. de Villiers since 1999.\n\n== Select pastors ==\n* Charles Frederik Mynhardt, 12 April 1908\u20131910\n* S.W. van Niekerk, 1911\u20131921\n* Thomas Arnoldus Broodrijk, 1921 \u2013 August 17, 1932 (died in office; his only congregation)\n* Adriaan Hendrickus Stander, 1933\u20131948\n* Daniel Ferdinand Bosman (Dan) de Beer, 1935\u20131937 (curate)\n* Johannes Petrus Grobler, 1943\u20131944 (curate)\n* Jacob de Jager, 1948\u20131958\n* Cornelis Albertys van Wyk, 1958\u20131963\n* Jacobus Cornelius le Roux, 1963\u20131969\n* Roelof Johannes Janse van Vuuren, 1969\u20131973\n* Jan van der Vloed, 1973\u20131977\n* Francois Jacobus Joubert, 1978\u20131986\n* Hendrik Christoffel van der Merwe, 1985\u20131992\n* Johan Willem Ludwig Gebhardt, 1987\u20131990\n* Stephanus Petrus Kloppers, 1990\u20131995 (then Deo Gloria until 1999)\n\n== Sources ==\n* ''Acts of the 4th Conference of the South Transvaal NGK Synod, Pretoria, March 26\u201327, 1963''.\n* Albertyn, J.R.

It was founded in 1906 and for years had a large membership, at times exceeding 3,000.\n\n88 years after its foundation and 44 years after that of the [[Johannesburg South Reformed Church (NGK)]], however, the two congregations would merge to form the Deo Gloria Reformed Church on April 24, 1994. This was due in part to the emigration of [[Afrikaners]] toward more affluent neighborhoods as well as the burning down of the neglected Turffontein Church, which the congregation could not afford to rebuild, in March 1992. The merger ended the oldest congregation in southern downtown Johannesburg, from which sprang all others in the area.\n\n== Background ==\nWhen the [[Johannesburg East Reformed Church (NGK)]] and the [[Jeppestown Reformed Church]] seceded from the oldest NGK church on the Rand, the [[Johannesburg Reformed Church (NGK)]], on July 8, 1897, Casey's Town (later known as [[Turffontein]]) became part of the Jeppestown congregation. Even before then, Johannesburg pastors Rev. J.N. Martins and [[Pieter Gerhardus Jacobus Meiring]] held services in a small meeting hall in Casey's Town. Serving the southern areas of Jeppestown proved especially challenging, since Rev. [[Paul Nel]] could only spare two Sundays a month to preach there. The Rev. Meiring (since then having moved to the [[Johannesburg East Reformed Church (NGK)]]) and Rev. Dani\u00ebl Theron of the [[Fordsburg Reformed Church]] helped out at first, but had to be replaced by a missionary, brother MacLean, who himself remained there only a few months.\n\n== Turffontein church hall ==\nThe Jeppestown congregation building committee, on the recommendation of the church council, decided in June 1903 to replace the cramped, dilapidated local meeting hall with a new building and rent out the old one to schools after renovation. Several months later, T.D. Hannecke won the \u00a31,509 bid for construction, and on Saturday, July 30, 1904, Rev. Meiring laid the cornerstone. Speaking of the occasion, Rev. Nel said \u201cthat it will not be long before an independent congregation would be founded in Turffontein\u201d (quoted in the August 1904 issue of the Transvaal NGK magazine ''De Vereeniging'').

He is best known for the Darby Chronicles Series, which is a series of seven novels written between 1979 and 2014 about modern life in a fictional [[New Hampshire]] town as it transitions from relative rural poverty to being more upscale, almost suburban. He has also written several stand-alone novels, including ''Mad Boys'', ''The Old American'', and ''The Contrarian Voice: And Other Poems''.<ref>http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ernesthebert/</ref>\n\nHebert was born in [[Keene, New Hampshire]], and was named after his mother's eldest brother, Reverend Joseph Ernest Vaccarest. Ernest attended public school and graduated from Keene High School in 1959. He applied to Keene State College upon graduation, but was initially denied admission based on his ACT scores. As a result, he served in the army reserves for six months before beginning work at the [[New England Telephone and Telegraph Company]] as a central office equipment installer. After the assassination of [[President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, he decided to quit his job and reapply to [[Keene State College]].<ref>https://commons.keene.edu/handle/20.500.12088/9207</ref>\n\nUpon admission to college, Hebert hired a retired Keene school teacher to tutor him in English studies. The reading assignment she chose for him was [[The History of Henry Esmond, Esq.]] by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], which he intensely disliked. He began his college career in the fall of 1964 and initially majored in History. After several semesters, however, he realized that he much preferred writing to history. In his junior year, Hebert read the poem [[Preludes (poem)|Preludes]] by [[T.S. Eliot]] which entirely transformed his outlook on life. He then gave up writing prose to focus entirely on writing poetry and changed his major from History to English.<ref>https://commons.keene.edu/handle/20.500.12088/9177</ref>\n\nHebert met his future wife, Medora Lavoie, at Keene State College. They married in early 1969, the same year that Ernest graduated from Keene State. Upon graduation, Hebert and his wife moved to California so that Hebert could attend Stanford University in pursuit of a master's degree. While attending Stanford, Hebert studied creative writing with a concentration in poetry. After several semesters, however, Hebert concluded that he had learned everything he could from his professors and that graduate school was not for him. He and his wife then returned to New Hampshire so that Medora could finish her bachelor's degree at Keene State College.\n\nHebert then began working as a journalist for several newspaper during this time period, including The Keene Sentinel Newspaper, Business NH Magazine, The New Hampshire Times, and [[The Boston Globe]]. In 1972, he won two Journalism Excellence Awards from United Press International. One of the awards was for an article he wrote about a moose that had wandered into the city of Keene one day. During this time period, Hebert wrote ''The Dogs of March'', which was published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979. This novel was the first book in his Darby Chronicles Series of novels, which centers around the fictional town of Darby, New Hampshire. Over the last several decades, Hebert has continued to write this series, which includes: ''A Little More Than Kin'', ''Whisper My Name'', ''The Passion of Estelle Jordan'', ''Live Free or Die'', ''Spoonwood'', and ''Howard Elman's Farewell''.

He is best known for the Darby Chronicles Series, which is a series of seven novels written between 1979 and 2014 about modern life in a fictional [[New Hampshire]] town as it transitions from relative rural poverty to being more upscale, almost suburban. He has also written several stand-alone novels, including ''Mad Boys'', ''The Old American'', and ''The Contrarian Voice: And Other Poems''.<ref>http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ernesthebert/</ref>\n\nHebert was born in [[Keene, New Hampshire]], and was named after his mother's eldest brother, Reverend Joseph Ernest Vaccarest. Ernest attended public school and graduated from Keene High School in 1959. He applied to Keene State College upon graduation, but was initially denied admission based on his ACT scores. As a result, he served in the army reserves for six months before beginning work at the [[New England Telephone and Telegraph Company]] as a central office equipment installer. After the assassination of [[President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, he decided to quit his job and reapply to [[Keene State College]]. <ref>https://commons.keene.edu/handle/20.500.12088/9207</ref>\n\nUpon admission to college, Hebert hired a retired Keene school teacher to tutor him in English studies. The reading assignment she chose for him was [[The History of Henry Esmond, Esq.]] by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], which he intensely disliked. He began his college career in the fall of 1964 and initially majored in History. After several semesters, however, he realized that he much preferred writing to history. In his junior year, Hebert read the poem [[Preludes (poem)|Preludes]] by [[T.S. Eliot]] which entirely transformed his outlook on life. He then gave up writing prose to focus entirely on writing poetry and changed his major from History to English.<ref>https://commons.keene.edu/handle/20.500.12088/9177</ref> \n\nHebert met his future wife, Medora Lavoie, at Keene State College. They married in early 1969, the same year that Ernest graduated from Keene State. Upon graduation, Hebert and his wife moved to California so that Hebert could attend Stanford University in pursuit of a master's degree. While attending Stanford, Hebert studied creative writing with a concentration in poetry. After several semesters, however, Hebert concluded that he had learned everything he could from his professors and that graduate school was not for him. He and his wife then returned to New Hampshire so that Medora could finish her bachelor's degree at Keene State College. \n\nHebert then began working as a journalist for several newspaper during this time period, including The Keene Sentinel Newspaper, Business NH Magazine, The New Hampshire Times, and [[The Boston Globe]]. In 1972, he won two Journalism Excellence Awards from United Press International. One of the awards was for an article he wrote about a moose that had wandered into the city of Keene one day. During this time period, Hebert wrote ''The Dogs of March'', which was published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979. This novel was the first book in his Darby Chronicles Series of novels, which centers around the fictional town of Darby, New Hampshire. Over the last several decades, Hebert has continued to write this series, which includes: ''A Little More Than Kin'', ''Whisper My Name'', ''The Passion of Estelle Jordan'', ''Live Free or Die'', ''Spoonwood'', and ''Howard Elman's Farewell''. He has also written several stand-alone works, the most recent of which was a collection of poetry titled ''The Contrarian Voice: And Other Poems''.\n\nIn addition to his writing, Hebert worked as a professor of English and [[creative writing]] at [[Dartmouth College]] for more than 25 years before retiring.<ref>https://blog.workflowy.com/2017/07/11/interview-with-ernest-hebert/</ref> Over the course of his career as a professor, he taught several notable people, including [[David Benioff]].<ref>https://www2.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2019/04/15/game-thrones-producer-writing-career-got-off-rocky-start-dartmouth-college/vkDyk3MenmCXdJWhXdAT5N/story.html</ref> Hebert is the first member of faculty at Dartmouth College to be tenured as a fiction writer. <ref>https://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/publishing/books/hebert2012/</ref> \n\nBecause of the prolific nature of his writing career, much of Hebert's work has been donated to university archives in New Hampshire.

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history.

Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record.

The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach.

With almost 24,000 seats, it was (and still remains) the largest basketball-specific venue in the league by seating capacity. The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004\u201305 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a [[Rolling Stones]] concert.\nIn April 2008, the Bobcats reached a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest [[cable television]] provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats' exposure over the team's first four years (see below).<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\">{{cite press release|title=Bobcats, Time Warner Cable, Fox Sports Strike Unprecedented Deal|url=http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|publisher=Charlotte Bobcats|date=April 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420070145/http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|archivedate=April 20, 2008|accessdate=June 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AP: Time Warner gets naming rights for Bobcats Arena|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/bobcats/2008-04-07-time-warner-rights_N.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref> When the Hornets returned to Charlotte, \"The Hive\" nickname also returned to the arena.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]].

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], the Hornets finished with a 50\u201332 record, returning to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1995.html|title=Charlotte Hornets 1994\u20131995 Summary|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-04-9511040064-story.html|title=Mourning OFF To Miami|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=November 4, 1995|publisher=Chicago Tribune|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998: Glen Rice era====\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season. The move came mainly because attendance tailed off dramatically, reportedly due to Shinn's declining popularity in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Move To New Orleans Approved|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 10, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805150133/http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/New_Orleans_Approved.html|archivedate=August 5, 2002|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19900329&id=7fweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZlIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6688,3395525}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/charhorn/charhornets.html |title=Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002) |publisher=SportsECyclopedia.com |date=February 28, 2015 |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2004\u20132014: Charlotte Bobcats===\nShortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in Charlotte for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]], given an arena deal could be reached.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belkin's potential ownership group includes Bird, Carr |url=http://a.espncdn.com/nba/news/2002/0619/1396833.html |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 19, 2002 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref> Several ownership groups, including one led by former [[Boston Celtics]] star [[Larry Bird]], made bids for the franchise.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bird, Carr thinking pro hoops in Charlotte? |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/stories/2002-05-20-bird-carr-charlotte.htm}}</ref> On December 18, 2002, a group led by [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L.

Inside the 'C' was a smaller white letter 'H' outlined in teal, with a black colored hornet holding a basketball from birds-eye view placed in the center. The 'H' portion of the logo remained on the warm-ups and waistband of the jerseys until the 1991\u201392 season.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Bobcats primary logo from 2004 to 2012 consisted of a snarling orange bobcat facing to the right with the indented name 'Bobcats' above in silver on a blue background, with 'Charlotte' (also indented) appearing above it in the same blue color. A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange. This logo would become prominent in the team's marketing and be featured at center court from 2007\u201308 until 2013\u201314.\n\nCharlotte's second Hornets logo features a teal and purple forward-facing hornet with the words 'Charlotte Hornets' on its torso.

The team chose teal and purple as its primary colors and featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014pinstripes. While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and their home city on away jerseys, the Hornets' uniforms had \"Charlotte\" on both home and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal.

Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

The home uniforms were white and featured an arched \"Bobcats\" in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched \"Charlotte\" in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms. The addition of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect owner Michael Jordan's [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|collegiate roots]], while the formal adoption of 'Cats' for marketing purposes reflected a popular nickname.\n\n====Hornets====\nThe newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team's uniforms on June 19, 2014, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the \"Hornets\" wordmark across the chest.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]]. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from [[oldies]] to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Charlotte Hornets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Charlotte Bobcats}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Charlotte Hornets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Charlotte Bobcats seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{North Carolina Sports}}\n{{Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports|United States}}\n\n[[Category:Charlotte Hornets| ]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Bobcats| ]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets"}

Orchids in this genus are native to [[India]], [[China]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Australia]] with the majority in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].\n\n== Description ==\nOrchids in the genus ''Phalaenopsis'' are monopodial epiphytic, sometimes lithophytic [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]] with long, coarse roots and short leafy stems hidden by overlapping leaf bases. The leaves are usually arranged in two rows, relatively large and leathery, oblong to elliptic and sometimes succulent. A few to many, small to large, long-lasting, flat, often fragrant flowers are arranged on erect to hanging [[raceme]]s or [[panicle]]s. The [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s are free from and spread widely apart from each other. The [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] sepals are usually larger than the [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] sepal and the petals much wider than the sepals. The [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]] is joined stiffly to the [[Column (botany)|column]] and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and more or less parallel to each other and the middle lobe sometimes has a pair of appendages or antennae.<ref name=\"Jones\" /><ref name=\"China\">{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=Xinqi |last2=Wood |first2=Jeffrey James |title=''Phalaenopsis'' |url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=124878 |publisher=Flora of China |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"trin\">{{cite web |title=''Phalaenopsis'' |url=http://keys.trin.org.au:8080/key-server/data/08090a09-0d0e-410b-860c-020705070e0e/media/Html/genera/Phalaenopsis.htm |publisher=Trin keys |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"ONG\">{{cite web |title=Genus ''Phalaenopsis'' |url=http://www.orchidsnewguinea.com/orchid-information/genus/genuscode/40 |publisher=Orchids of New Guinea |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Phalaenopsis Page|url=http://www.orchidspecies.com/phalenopsis.htm|work=Internet Orchid Species Photo Encyclopedia|publisher=Jay Pfahl|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nThe genus ''Phalaenopsis'' was first formally described in 1825 by [[Carl Ludwig Blume]] and the description was published in ''Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb''.<ref name=\"WCSP\" /><ref name=\"Blume\">{{cite book |last1=Blume |first1=Carl Ludwig |title=Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb (Part 7) |date=1825 |location=Batavia |page=294 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/9224#page/11/mode/1up |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref> The name ''Phalaenopsis'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''phalaina'' (\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1) meaning \"a kind of moth\"<ref name=\"RWB\">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|authorlink1=Roland W.

flowers turn into green leaves after pollination. As in many other plants, the petals of the orchid flowers serve to attract pollinating insects and protect essential organs. Following pollination, petals usually will undergo [[senescence]] (i.e. wilt and disintegrate) because it is metabolically expensive to maintain them. In many ''Phalaenopsis'' species, such as ''P. violacea'', the petals and sepals find new uses following pollination, thus escaping [[programmed cell death]]. In producing [[chloroplast]]s, they turn green, become fleshy, and apparently, start to photosynthesize, as leaves do.<ref name=\"plant programmed cell death\">{{cite journal | author=Wouter G. van Doorn| title=Plant programmed cell death and the point of no return| journal=Trends in Plant Science| year=October 2005| volume=10| issue=10| doi= 10.1016/j.tplants.2005.08.003| pages=478\u2013483 | pmid=16153879}}</ref>\n\n== Use in horticulture ==\n[[Image:violacea.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Phalaenopsis bellina'']]\n''Phalaenopsis'', abbreviated '''Phal''' in the [[horticulture|horticultural trade]],<ref>http://www.orchidsplus.com/phalaenopsis-moth-orchids/</ref> are among the most popular orchids sold as potted plants, owing to the ease of propagation and flowering under artificial conditions. They were among the first tropical orchids in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] collections. Since the advent of the [[Polyploidy|tetraploid]] hybrid ''Phalaenopsis'' Doris, they have become extremely easy to grow and flower in the home, as long as some care is taken to provide them with conditions that approximate their native habitats. Their commercial production has become an industry.\n\nIf very healthy, a ''Phalaenopsis'' plant may have up to ten or more leaves. They bloom in their full glory for several weeks. If kept in the home, the flowers may last two to three months after which a phalaenopsis orchid will need to conserve energy for further leaf, bud, and root development.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Care for Orchids: A Comprehensive Organic Guide|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/organic-gardening-blog/orchid-care/how-to-care-for-orchids-organic-guide/}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, ''Phalaenopsis'' species are typically fond of warm temperatures, thriving in temperatures around 20 to 35 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]] (68\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F), but are adaptable to conditions more comfortable for human habitation in temperate zones (15 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C or 59\u201386&nbsp;\u00b0F); at temperatures below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) overwatering causes root rot. ''Phalaenopsis'' requires high humidity (60\u201370%) and low light of 12,000 to 20,000 [[lux]]. However, Phalaenopsis orchids can adapt to the lower humidity found in most homes. They are also typically hardier than other species of orchids, and this makes them particularly popular among first-time orchid growers.<ref>[http://www.plantdex.com/index.php/species-growing-guides/flowers/130-phalaenopsis-orchid Growing Conditions for Phalaenopsis Orchids, Accessed 11/11/2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073443/http://www.plantdex.com/index.php/species-growing-guides/flowers/130-phalaenopsis-orchid |date=2013-01-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe flower spikes appear from the pockets near the base of each leaf. The first sign is a light green \"mitten-like\" object that protrudes from the basal leaf tissue. Over approximately three months the spike elongates until it begins to swell fat buds that will bloom.\n\nIt previously was believed that flowering is triggered by a night-time drop in temperature of around 5 to 6 degrees over two to four consecutive weeks, usually in the fall, and a day-time drop in temperature to below {{convert|29|\u00b0C|0}}. Using two ''Phalaenopsis'' clones, Matthew G. Blanchard and Erik S. Runkle (2006) established that, other culture conditions being optimal, flower initiation is controlled by daytime temperatures declining below {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0}}, with a definite inhibition of flowering at temperatures exceeding {{convert|29|\u00b0C|0}}. The long-held belief that reduced evening temperatures control flower initiation in ''Phalaenopsis'' was shown to be false. Rather, lower daytime temperatures influence flowering, while night time temperatures do not appear to have any effect.<ref name=\"Phalaenopsis\">{{cite journal |author1=Blanchard, Matthew G |author2=Runkle, Erik S | title=Temperature during the day, but not during the night, controls flowering of Phalaenopsis orchids| journal=Journal of Experimental Botany| year=2006| volume=57| issue=15| url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/15/4043| pages=4043\u20134050 | doi=10.1093/jxb/erl176 | pmid=17075080}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn ''Phalaenopsis'', [[phenylpropanoid]] enzymes are enhanced in the process of plant [[acclimatisation]] at different levels of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] photon flux.<ref>Mohammad Babar Ali, Serida Khatun, Eun-Joo Hahn and Kee-Yoeup Paek,, 2006. \"Enhancement of phenylpropanoid enzymes and lignin in Phalaenopsis orchid and their influence on plant acclimatisation at different levels of photosynthetic photon flux\".

Orchids in this genus are [[monopodial]] [[epiphyte]]s or [[lithophyte]]s with long, coarse roots, short, leafy stems and long-lasting, flat flowers arranged in a flowering stem that often branches near the end. Orchids in this genus are native to [[India]], [[China]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Australia]] with the majority in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].\n\n== Description ==\nOrchids in the genus ''Phalaenopsis'' are monopodial epiphytic, sometimes lithophytic [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]] with long, coarse roots and short leafy stems hidden by overlapping leaf bases. The leaves are usually arranged in two rows, relatively large and leathery, oblong to elliptic and sometimes succulent. A few to many, small to large, long-lasting, flat, often fragrant flowers are arranged on erect to hanging [[raceme]]s or [[panicle]]s. The [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s are free from and spread widely apart from each other. The [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] sepals are usually larger than the [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] sepal and the petals much wider than the sepals. The [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]] is joined stiffly to the [[Column (botany)|column]] and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and more or less parallel to each other and the middle lobe sometimes has a pair of appendages or antennae.<ref name=\"Jones\" /><ref name=\"China\">{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=Xinqi |last2=Wood |first2=Jeffrey James |title=''Phalaenopsis'' |url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=124878 |publisher=Flora of China |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"trin\">{{cite web |title=''Phalaenopsis'' |url=http://keys.trin.org.au:8080/key-server/data/08090a09-0d0e-410b-860c-020705070e0e/media/Html/genera/Phalaenopsis.htm |publisher=Trin keys |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"ONG\">{{cite web |title=Genus ''Phalaenopsis'' |url=http://www.orchidsnewguinea.com/orchid-information/genus/genuscode/40 |publisher=Orchids of New Guinea |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Phalaenopsis Page|url=http://www.orchidspecies.com/phalenopsis.htm|work=Internet Orchid Species Photo Encyclopedia|publisher=Jay Pfahl|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nThe genus ''Phalaenopsis'' was first formally described in 1825 by [[Carl Ludwig Blume]] and the description was published in ''Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb''.<ref name=\"WCSP\" /><ref name=\"Blume\">{{cite book |last1=Blume |first1=Carl Ludwig |title=Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb (Part 7) |date=1825 |location=Batavia |page=294 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/9224#page/11/mode/1up |accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref> The name ''Phalaenopsis'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''phalaina'' (\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1) meaning \"a kind of moth\"<ref name=\"RWB\">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|authorlink1=Roland W.

flowers turn into green leaves after pollination. As in many other plants, the petals of the orchid flowers serve to attract pollinating insects and protect essential organs. Following pollination, petals usually will undergo [[senescence]] (i.e. wilt and disintegrate) because it is metabolically expensive to maintain them. In many ''Phalaenopsis'' species, such as ''P. violacea'', the petals and sepals find new uses following pollination, thus escaping [[programmed cell death]]. In producing [[chloroplast]]s, they turn green, become fleshy, and apparently, start to photosynthesize, as leaves do.<ref name=\"plant programmed cell death\">{{cite journal | author=Wouter G. van Doorn| title=Plant programmed cell death and the point of no return| journal=Trends in Plant Science| year=October 2005| volume=10| issue=10| doi= 10.1016/j.tplants.2005.08.003| pages=478\u2013483 | pmid=16153879}}</ref>\n\n== Use in horticulture ==\n[[Image:violacea.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Phalaenopsis bellina'']]\n''Phalaenopsis'', abbreviated '''Phal''' in the [[horticulture|horticultural trade]],<ref>http://www.orchidsplus.com/phalaenopsis-moth-orchids/</ref> are among the most popular orchids sold as potted plants, owing to the ease of propagation and flowering under artificial conditions. They were among the first tropical orchids in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] collections. Since the advent of the [[Polyploidy|tetraploid]] hybrid ''Phalaenopsis'' Doris, they have become extremely easy to grow and flower in the home, as long as some care is taken to provide them with conditions that approximate their native habitats. Their commercial production has become an industry.\n\nIf very healthy, a ''Phalaenopsis'' plant may have up to ten or more leaves. They bloom in their full glory for several weeks. If kept in the home, the flowers may last two to three months after which a phalaenopsis orchid will need to conserve energy for further leaf, bud, and root development.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Care for Orchids: A Comprehensive Organic Guide|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/organic-gardening-blog/orchid-care/how-to-care-for-orchids-organic-guide/}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, ''Phalaenopsis'' species are typically fond of warm temperatures, thriving in temperatures around 20 to 35 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]] (68\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F), but are adaptable to conditions more comfortable for human habitation in temperate zones (15 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C or 59\u201386&nbsp;\u00b0F); at temperatures below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) overwatering causes root rot. ''Phalaenopsis'' requires high humidity (60\u201370%) and low light of 12,000 to 20,000 [[lux]]. However, Phalaenopsis orchids can adapt to the lower humidity found in most homes. They are also typically hardier than other species of orchids, and this makes them particularly popular among first-time orchid growers.<ref>[http://www.plantdex.com/index.php/species-growing-guides/flowers/130-phalaenopsis-orchid Growing Conditions for Phalaenopsis Orchids, Accessed 11/11/2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073443/http://www.plantdex.com/index.php/species-growing-guides/flowers/130-phalaenopsis-orchid |date=2013-01-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe flower spikes appear from the pockets near the base of each leaf. The first sign is a light green \"mitten-like\" object that protrudes from the basal leaf tissue. Over approximately three months the spike elongates until it begins to swell fat buds that will bloom.\n\nIt previously was believed that flowering is triggered by a night-time drop in temperature of around 5 to 6 degrees over two to four consecutive weeks, usually in the fall, and a day-time drop in temperature to below {{convert|29|\u00b0C|0}}. Using two ''Phalaenopsis'' clones, Matthew G. Blanchard and Erik S. Runkle (2006) established that, other culture conditions being optimal, flower initiation is controlled by daytime temperatures declining below {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0}}, with a definite inhibition of flowering at temperatures exceeding {{convert|29|\u00b0C|0}}. The long-held belief that reduced evening temperatures control flower initiation in ''Phalaenopsis'' was shown to be false. Rather, lower daytime temperatures influence flowering, while night time temperatures do not appear to have any effect.<ref name=\"Phalaenopsis\">{{cite journal |author1=Blanchard, Matthew G |author2=Runkle, Erik S | title=Temperature during the day, but not during the night, controls flowering of Phalaenopsis orchids| journal=Journal of Experimental Botany| year=2006| volume=57| issue=15| url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/15/4043| pages=4043\u20134050 | doi=10.1093/jxb/erl176 | pmid=17075080}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn ''Phalaenopsis'', [[phenylpropanoid]] enzymes are enhanced in the process of plant [[acclimatisation]] at different levels of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] photon flux.<ref>Mohammad Babar Ali, Serida Khatun, Eun-Joo Hahn and Kee-Yoeup Paek,, 2006. \"Enhancement of phenylpropanoid enzymes and lignin in Phalaenopsis orchid and their influence on plant acclimatisation at different levels of photosynthetic photon flux\".
