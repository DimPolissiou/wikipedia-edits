He was born in St. Albans, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. Grimaldi was educated at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)#20th century|St. Albans Boys School]], where he developed his talent for electric jazz, songwriting and art. His career focused on the Jazz genre, although he played other genres as well. Grimaldi formed a number of bands and wrote and performed until his death from multiple sclerosis in 1983.\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===[http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/motiffe Motiffe]===\nGrimaldi became interested in music after he joined his school's orchestra in his early teenage years. While in the school orchestra, he discovered his talent with stringed instruments and his ability to write music. John and Mark Pasterfield set up a school band called [http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/motiffe/ Motiffe] in 1970. As Pasterfield had a drum kit, he became the drummer; Dave Shackley played bass; Ian Wilson, Quentin Bryar, and Steve Bellingham played keyboards. Bellingham left in 1971 and Mick Avery then joined on keyboard. In early 1972 they reached their live peak with a support slot to Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's ELO, shortly after they were recorded live in St Albans School by Deroy; 100 copies of the album were produced, some of which were still around in 2013.\n\n===[http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/flux Flux]===\n'''(1972\u20131974)''' <br />\nSoon afterward in 1972, there was conflict within Motiffe regarding what and how much the band should play. To resolve to conflict, John Grimaldi and Dave Shackley started a new band named Flux, aiming to become professional.\nNeil Chapman (drums) and Phil Hawkins (keyboard) joined to make up the band. Flux recorded, though nothing was released. Flux also performed live, and started to attract some attention. The St. Albans band Babe Ruth and their management took Flux under their wing. In late 1972 Flux were gaining in popularity, and receiving interest from the music industry. Chapman left to be replaced by Charlie Chandler from Hemel Hempstead on drums; Dave Punshon (keyboard) left Babe Ruth to join Flux, however he agreed to continue to do live performances with Babe Ruth until a replacement was found. Richard Blanchard, a flute, sax & vocalist from Pinner joined. The band, with this line-up, played regularly & widely including 100 club & Marquee.\n\nFlux recorded a demo for EMI harvest at Manchester Square and was nearly signed, but it did not happen. However, there was interest from other companies. About this time Punshon left to live with the Divine Light Movement, and was replaced by pro circuit musician Zo\u00eb Kronberger (keyboard). Chandler left to rebuild antique furniture, and was replaced by pro circuit musician Nick Monas (drums). Blanchard, who was also a professional photographer, left to focus on increasing demands of his photography work and to pursue other music opportunities. He was replaced by circuit pro Jon Gifford (flute/sax).\n\nKronberger and Monas eventually left in mid-1974. Soon afterward, John did the Argent audition and went to them, resulting in Flux folding in late 1974.\n\n===[https://soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/the-argent-years Argent]===\n'''(1974 \u2013 1975/76)'''<br />\n\nIn 1974, Russ Ballard left Argent; [http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/the-argent-years Grimaldi] and [[John Verity]] joined the band to replace him.
