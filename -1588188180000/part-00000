This article provides a brief review of growth rates, including the idea of a '''function of exponential type'''. Classification of growth rates based on type help provide a finer tool than [[big O notation|big O]] or [[Landau notation]], since a number of theorems about the analytic structure of the bounded function and its [[integral transform]]s can be stated. In particular, Nachbin's theorem may be used to give the domain of convergence of the '''generalized Borel transform''', given below.\n\n==Exponential type==\n{{Main|Exponential type}}\nA function ''f''(''z'') defined on the [[complex plane]] is said to be of exponential type if there exist constants ''M'' and \u03b1 such that\n\n:<math>|f(re^{i\\theta})|\\le Me^{\\alpha r}</math>\n\nin the limit of <math>r\\to\\infty</math>. Here, the [[complex variable]] ''z'' was written as <math>z=re^{i\\theta}</math> to emphasize that the limit must hold in all directions \u03b8.  Letting \u03b1 stand for the [[infimum]] of all such \u03b1, one then says that the function ''f'' is of ''exponential type \u03b1''.\n\nFor example, let <math>f(z)=\\sin(\\pi z)</math>. Then one says that <math>\\sin(\\pi z)</math> is of exponential type \u03c0, since \u03c0 is the smallest number that bounds the growth of <math>\\sin(\\pi z)</math> along the imaginary axis. So, for this example, [[Carlson's theorem]] cannot apply, as it requires functions of exponential type less than \u03c0.\n\n==&Psi; type==\nBounding may be defined for other functions besides the exponential function. In general, a function <math>\\Psi(t)</math> is a '''comparison function''' if it has a series\n\n:<math>\\Psi(t)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\Psi_n t^n</math>\n\nwith <math>\\Psi_n>0</math> for all ''n'', and\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\Psi_{n+1}}{\\Psi_n} = 0.</math>\n\nComparison functions are necessarily [[entire function|entire]], which follows from the [[ratio test]]. If <math>\\Psi(t)</math> is such a comparison function, one then says that ''f'' is of \u03a8-type if there exist constants ''M'' and ''&tau;'' such that\n\n:<math>\\left|f\\left(re^{i\\theta}\\right)\\right| \\le M\\Psi(\\tau r)</math>\n\nas <math>r\\to \\infty</math>. If \u03c4 is the infimum of all such ''&tau;'' one says that ''f'' is of \u03a8-type ''&tau;''.\n\nNachbin's theorem states that a function ''f''(''z'') with the series\n\n:<math>f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n z^n</math>\n\nis of \u03a8-type \u03c4 if and only if\n\n:<math>\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left| \\frac{f_n}{\\Psi_n} \\right|^{1/n} = \\tau.</math>\n\n==Borel transform==\nNachbin's theorem has immediate applications in [[Cauchy's integral formula|Cauchy theorem]]-like situations, and for [[integral transforms]].  For example, the '''generalized Borel transform''' is given by\n\n:<math>F(w)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{f_n}{\\Psi_n w^{n+1}}.</math>\n\nIf ''f'' is of \u03a8-type ''&tau;'', then the exterior of the domain of convergence of <math>F(w)</math>, and all of its singular points, are contained within the disk\n\n:<math>|w| \\le \\tau.</math>\n\nFurthermore, one has\n\n:<math>f(z)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_\\gamma \\Psi (zw) F(w)\\, dw</math>\n\nwhere the [[contour of integration]] \u03b3 encircles the disk <math>|w| \\le \\tau</math>.  This generalizes the usual '''Borel transform''' for exponential type, where <math>\\Psi(t)=e^t</math>.  The integral form for the generalized Borel transform follows as well. Let <math>\\alpha(t)</math> be a function whose first derivative is bounded on the interval <math>[0,\\infty)</math>, so that\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\Psi_n} = \\int_0^\\infty t^n\\, d\\alpha(t)</math>\n\nwhere <math>d\\alpha(t)=\\alpha^{\\prime}(t)\\,dt</math>. Then the integral form of the generalized Borel transform is\n\n:<math>F(w)=\\frac{1}{w} \\int_0^\\infty f \\left(\\frac{t}{w}\\right) \\, d\\alpha(t).</math>\n\nThe ordinary Borel transform is regained by setting <math>\\alpha(t)=e^{-t}</math>. Note that the integral form of the Borel transform is just the [[Laplace transform]].\n\n==Nachbin resummation==\nNachbin resummation (generalized Borel transform) can be used to sum divergent series that escape to the usual [[Borel summation]] or even to solve (asymptotically) integral equations of the form:\n\n:<math> g(s)=s\\int_0^\\infty K(st) f(t)\\,dt </math>\n\nwhere ''f''(''t'') may or may not be of exponential growth and the kernel ''K''(''u'') has a [[Mellin transform]]. The solution can be obtained as <math> f(x)= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{M(n+1)}x^n </math>  with <math> g(s)= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n s^{-n} </math> and ''M''(''n'') is the Mellin transform of ''K''(''u''). An example of this is the Gram series  <math> \\pi (x) \\approx 1+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\log^{n}(x)}{n\\cdot n!\\zeta (n+1)}.</math>\n\nin some cases as an extra condition we require <math> \\int_0^\\infty K(t)t^{n}\\,dt </math> to be finite for <math>n=0,1,2,3,...</math> and different from 0.\n\n==Fr\u00e9chet space==\nCollections of functions of exponential type <math>\\tau</math> can form a [[complete space|complete]] [[uniform space]], namely a [[Fr\u00e9chet space]], by the [[topological space|topology]] induced by the countable family of [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s\n\n:<math> \\|f\\|_{n} = \\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{C}} \\exp \\left[-\\left(\\tau + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)|z|\\right]|f(z)|.</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Divergent series]]\n* [[Borel summation]]\n* [[Euler summation]]\n* [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]]\n* [[Lambert summation]]\n* [[Mittag-Leffler summation]]\n* [[Phragm\u00e9n\u2013Lindel\u00f6f principle]]\n* [[Abelian and tauberian theorems]]\n* [[Van Wijngaarden transformation]]\n\n==References==\n* L.

Beast plans to abdicate in favor of his and Belle's son, Ben, who announces a program to invite four children from the Isle of the Lost to live in Auradon, away from the influence of their villainous parents: Carlos, son of [[Cruella de Vil]]; Jay, son of [[Jafar (Disney character)|Jafar]]; Evie, daughter of [[Evil Queen (Disney)|the Evil Queen]]; and their gang's leader Mal, daughter of [[Maleficent]]. Maleficent orders them to steal the [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#The Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]]'s [[magic wand]] and deactivate the barrier, so Maleficent can conquer Auradon.  But the four find themselves fitting in and enjoying a normal childhood, and Mal begins a relationship with Ben, supplanting Audrey, daughter of [[Aurora (Disney character)|Princess Aurora]] and Prince Phillip.  When the barrier is inadvertently dispelled, Maleficent attacks Ben's coronation and transforms into a [[dragon]].  With Ben encouraging her to make her own choice, Mal decides to be good. She and her friends rebuke Maleficent, turning her into a small [[lizard]], from which state she can recover if she fills her heart with love.

Mal decides she does not belong in Auradon; she returns to the Isle, where gang leadership has fallen to her old rival, pirate captain Uma ([[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]]'s daughter), and her first and second mates, respectively, Harry ([[Captain Hook]]'s son) and Gil ([[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]]'s son). Evie, Jay, and Carlos agree to help Ben find her, but Mal rejects Ben, believing it best for him and Auradon. Uma captures Ben and demands the Fairy Godmother's wand in exchange for his life. Uma resents not being chosen to live in Auradon; Ben respects her as a leader and invites her to Auradon, but she vows to make her own way there instead. Using a [[3D printing|3D-printed]] decoy wand, Mal's group rescues Ben. At the shipboard Royal Cotillion, Uma appears as Ben's date and he announces he will destroy the barrier; Mal realizes Uma has cast a spell on Ben. When Mal discovers Ben commissioned a portrait that depicts her as she was before she changed herself with magic, she accepts the emotion of love and kisses Ben, breaking the spell. Uma and Mal battle, transforming into an [[octopus]] and a [[dragon]], respectively. Ben tries to negotiate with Uma, but she leaves, unreconciled. Evie asks to bring more children from the Isle to Auradon and Ben agrees.\n\n===''Descendants 3'' (2019)===\n{{main|Descendants 3}}\n\nDisney Channel ordered the third film of the franchise on February 16, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/disney-announces-descendants-3-1202703195/|title=Disney Announces 'Descendants 3' for 2019|work=Variety|author=Ariana Brockington|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=2018-02-17}}</ref> The film premiered on August 2, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1036123/hades-is-pretty-mad-in-first-look-at-cheyenne-jackson-s-new-descendants-3-villain|title=Hades Is Pretty Mad in First Look at Cheyenne Jackson's New Descendants 3 Villain|website=EOnline.com|author=Lauren Piester|date=April 27, 2019|accessdate=April 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Descendants 3 Gets August Premiere Date, New Music Video \u2014 Watch|url=https://tvline.com/2019/05/31/descendants-3-premiere-date-watch-good-to-be-bad-music-video/|work=[[TVLine]]|date=May 31, 2019}}</ref> The movie received 4.6 million viewers on its premiere night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-8-2-2019.html|title=UPDATED: SHOWBUZZDAILY\u2019s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals\u00a0& Network Finals: 8.2.2019 {{!}} Showbuzz Daily|website=www.showbuzzdaily.com|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Ben proposes to Mal, making her the future queen of Auradon.

After graduating from Los Angeles's [[Otis College of Art and Design]], Gordon moved to New York City to begin an art career. There, she formed Sonic Youth with [[Thurston Moore]] in 1981. She and Moore married in 1984, and the band released a total of six albums on independent labels before the end of the 1980s. They would subsequently release nine studio albums on the major label [[DGC Records]], beginning with ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' in 1990. Gordon was also a founding member of the musical project [[Free Kitten]], which she formed with [[Julia Cafritz]] in 1993.\n\nSonic Youth released their sixteenth and final studio album, ''[[The Eternal (album)|The Eternal]]'' (2009), on [[Matador Records]] before disbanding in 2011 after Gordon and Moore separated. Following the dissolution of Sonic Youth and her divorce from Moore, Gordon formed the experimental duo [[Body/Head]] with Bill Nace, releasing their debut album ''[[Coming Apart (album)|Coming Apart]]'' in 2013. She subsequently formed [[Glitterbust]] with Alex Knost, releasing a self-titled debut album in 2016. Body/Head released their second studio album, ''The Switch'', in 2018. She released her first solo album, ''[[No Home Record]]'', in 2019. \n\nIn addition to her work as a musician, Gordon has had ventures in [[Record producer|record producing]], fashion, and acting, and has worked consistently as a visual artist throughout her musical career. She debuted as a producer on [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s debut album ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991), and founded the Los Angeles-based clothing line X-Girl in 1993.

Youth]].\n\nBorn in [[Rochester, New York]], Gordon was raised in [[Los Angeles]], California, where her father was a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. After graduating from Los Angeles's [[Otis College of Art and Design]], Gordon moved to New York City to begin an art career. There, she formed Sonic Youth with [[Thurston Moore]] in 1981. She and Moore married in 1984, and the band released a total of six albums on independent labels before the end of the 1980s. They would subsequently release nine studio albums on the major label [[DGC Records]], beginning with ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' in 1990. Gordon was also a founding member of the musical project [[Free Kitten]], which she formed with [[Julia Cafritz]] in 1993.\n\nSonic Youth released their sixteenth and final studio album, ''[[The Eternal (album)|The Eternal]]'' (2009), on [[Matador Records]] before disbanding in 2011 after Gordon and Moore separated. Following the dissolution of Sonic Youth and her divorce from Moore, Gordon formed the experimental duo [[Body/Head]] with Bill Nace, releasing their debut album ''[[Coming Apart (album)|Coming Apart]]'' in 2013. She subsequently formed [[Glitterbust]] with Alex Knost, releasing a self-titled debut album in 2016. Body/Head released their second studio album, ''The Switch'', in 2018. She released her first solo album, ''[[No Home Record]]'', in 2019. \n\nIn addition to her work as a musician, Gordon has had ventures in [[Record producer|record producing]], fashion, and acting, and has worked consistently as a visual artist throughout her musical career. She debuted as a producer on [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s debut album ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991), and founded the Los Angeles-based clothing line X-Girl in 1993. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Gordon began acting, making minor appearances in such films as ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005) and ''[[I'm Not There]]'' (2007), followed by guest-starring appearances on several television series. In February 2015, she published a memoir, ''[[Girl in a Band]]'', by [[HarperCollins]] imprint Dey Street Books.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1953\u20131978: Early life===\nKim Althea Gordon was born April 28, 1953{{sfn|George-Warren|Romanowski|2005|p=912}} in [[Rochester, New York]], the second child of Althea ({{abbr|d.|died}} 2002) and Calvin Wayne Gordon (1915{{en dash}}1998).<ref name=stage/><ref name=maron>{{cite interview|interviewer=[[Marc Maron]]|last=Gordon|first=Kim|work=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|date=March 26, 2015|title=Interview with Kim Gordon}}</ref><ref name=memoriam>{{cite web|work=University of California, Los Angeles|date=February 24, 1998|url=https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/WayneC.Gordon.htm|accessdate=August 23, 2018|title=In Memoriam: C.
