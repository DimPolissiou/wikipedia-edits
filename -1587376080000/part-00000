It ran for two seasons on [[CBS]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=530-531}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nEach episode is composed of several shorter segments featuring [[video game]] characters from the [[golden age of arcade video games]].\n\nThe segments included:\n\n* Frogger (from the ''[[Frogger]]'' arcade game)\n* [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] with [[Mario]] and [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] (from the ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game)\n* Donkey Kong Jr. (from the ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' arcade game)\n* Q*bert with Coily, Ugg, Wrongway, Slick and Sam (from the ''[[Q*bert]]'' arcade game)\n* Pitfall Harry with his pet [[Cougar|mountain lion]] Quickclaw and his niece Rhonda (unlike the others which are arcade games, this segment is from the [[video game console|home console]] game ''[[Pitfall!]]''). The cartoon was simply called \"Pitfall!\".\n\nPitfall! and Q*bert rotated weekly while the other three were weekly.\n\nDuring the second season, Q*bert (now weekly) and Donkey Kong remained while the Frogger, Donkey Kong Jr. and Pitfall! segments were replaced by shorts featuring:\n\n* Space Ace with Space Ace/Dexter (depending on his form), Kimberly, and Borf (from the ''[[Space Ace]]'' arcade game).\n* Kangaroo with friends and the \"Monkey Business Gang\" (from the ''[[Kangaroo (video game)|Kangaroo]]'' arcade game).\n\n==Segments==\n===Frogger===\n[[Frogger]] (voiced by [[Bob Sarlatte]]) is an ace [[Journalist|reporter]] of the swamp who works at ''The Swamp Gazette''. He and his friends Shellshock \"Shelly\" [[Turtle]] (voiced by [[Marvin Kaplan]]) and Fanny [[Frog]] (voiced by [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]]) go out in search of crazy stories (sometimes about human behavior) to publish in the newspaper. Frogger also has to deal with his gruff boss and [[editor-in-chief]] Tex Toadwalker (voiced by [[Ted Field, Sr.]]). As in the game, he often has an encounter with an [[alligator]] or gets flattened by a passing car.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"The Ms. Fortune Story\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Spaced Out Frogs\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"The Who-Took-Toadwalker Story\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"Hydrofoil & Seek\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"The Great Scuba Scoop\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"The Headline Hunters\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"The Legs Croaker Story\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"The Blackboard Bungle\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"Good Knight, Frogger\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"Fake Me Out to the Ball Game\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"I Remember Mummy\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Here Today, Pawned Tomorrow\" (December 3, 1983)\n# \"Hop-Along Frogger\" (December 10, 1983)\n\n===Donkey Kong===\n[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] (voiced by [[Soupy Sales]]) has escaped from the circus. He is on the lam, and [[Mario]] (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) and Pauline (voiced by [[Judy Strangis]]) are chasing the ape. As with the original game, Donkey Kong will often grab Pauline and Mario has to save her. Plots typically centered on them encountering crime with the villains conning the slow-witted Donkey Kong into doing their work and Mario and Pauline exposing the truth. After Mario and Pauline reveal the truth to Donkey Kong, the three of them team up to stop the antagonists' plans followed by Donkey Kong evading Mario and Pauline again.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Mississippi Madness\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Gorilla Gangster\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"Banana Bikers\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"The Incredible Shrinking Ape\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"Movie Mania\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"Gorilla My Dreams\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"Little Orphan Apey\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"Circus Daze\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"The Great Ape Escape\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"Apey and the Snowbeast\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"How Much is That Gorilla in the Window?\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Private Donkey Kong\" (December 3, 1983)\n# \"Get Along Little Apey\" (December 10, 1983)\n# \"Sir Donkey Kong\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"The Pale Whale\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"El Donkey Kong\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"New Wave Ape\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"Greenhouse Gorilla\" (October 6, 1984;This episode pays homage to Donkey Kong 3)\n# \"Hairy Parent\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"Gorilla on the trail\" (December 1,1984)\n\n===Q*bert===\nIn a 1950s-inspired world set in the town of Q*Berg, a teenage fur-covered, long-snouted creature named [[Q*bert]] (voiced by [[Billy Bowles]]), his girlfriend Q*Tee (voiced by Robbie Lee), his brother Q*Bit (voiced by [[Dick Beals]]), and his friends Q*Ball (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), Q*Val (voiced by Robbie Lee), and Q*Mongus (voiced by Frank Welker) must deal with the resident [[Bullying|bullies]] Coily, Ugg and Wrongway (all three voiced by Frank Welker), and Coily's girlfriend Viper (voiced by [[Julie McWhirter]]). As with the [[Q*Bert|video game]], the segment features \"block-hopping\" scenes, \"swearing\" bubbles and occasional flying discs from the original game. New to the cartoon was Q*bert's use of \"slippy-doos,\" a black ball projectile which he loaded and fired through his nose, producing an oil slick wherever the balls splattered. Slick and Sam (both voiced by Frank Welker) are also featured.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Disc Derby Fiasco\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"The Great Q*Tee Contest\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"Q*Ball Rigamarole\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"Crazy Camp Creature\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"Thanksgiving for the Memories\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Dog Day Dilemma\" (December 10, 1983)\n# \"Take Me Out to the Q*Game\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"Noser P.I.\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"Hook, Line, and Mermaid\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"[[Q*Historic Days]]\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"Q*bert's Monster Mix-Up\" (October 6, 1984)\n# \"Game Shoe Woe\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"The Wacky Q*Bot\" (October 20, 1984)\n# \"Q*Beat It\" (October 27, 1984)\n# \"Q*Urf's Up\" (November 3, 1984)\n# \"Little Green Nosers\" (November 10, 1984)\n# \"Rebel Without a Q*Ause\" (November 17, 1984)\n# \"Looking For Miss Q*Right\" (November 24, 1984)\n# \"The Goofy Ghostgetters\" (December 1, 1984)\n\n===Donkey Kong Jr.===\n[[Donkey Kong Jr.]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is sad to find that his father has run away from Mario and the circus. He befriends a [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] nicknamed \"Bones\" (voiced by [[Bart Braverman]]) who has a motorcycle and offers to help Junior by finding his dad together. Donkey Kong Jr's catchphrase is \"Monkey muscle!\", which he tells to himself and Bones to inspire self-confidence. Bones often serves as the voice of reason when Donkey Kong Jr. bites off more than he can chew.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Trucknapper Caper\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Sheep Rustle Hustle\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"Rocky Mountain Monkey Business\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"Magnificent 7-Year-Olds\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"The Ventriloquist Caper\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"The Great Seal Steal\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"The Jungle Boy Ploy\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"Junior Meets Kid Dynamo\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"Amazing Rollerskate Race\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"A Christmas Story\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"Gorilla Ghost\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Teddy Bear Scare\" (December 3, 1983)\n# \"Double or Nothing\" (December 10, 1983)\n\n===Pitfall!===\n[[Pitfall!|Pitfall Harry]] (voiced by [[Robert Ridgely]]), his niece Rhonda (voiced by [[Noelle North]]), and their cowardly pet Quickclaw the [[Cougar|Mountain Lion]] (voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]) explore jungles for hidden treasures, having many different adventures along the way. Quickclaw and Rhonda later appeared in ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]'' and ''[[Super Pitfall]]''.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Pitfall's Panda Puzzle\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Amazon Jungle Bungle\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"Raiders of the Lost Shark\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"Tibetan Treasure Trouble\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"Masked Menace Mess\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"The Sabretooth Goof\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"The Pyramid Panic\" (December 3, 1983)\n\n===Space Ace===\n[[Space Ace]] (voiced by [[Jim Piper (actor)|Jim Piper]]) is the always smiling self-confident champion of the \"Space Command\", whereas when always \"wimping out\" to Dexter (voiced by [[Sparky Marcus]]) after being hit by the Infanto-Ray, he becomes clumsy and weak. With officer Kimberly (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]), he works for Space Marshall Vaughn (voiced by [[Peter Renaday]]) to keep the peace in the universe. They fight the evil alien commander Borf (voiced by [[Arthur Burghardt]]) and keep him from invading Earth. Ace and Kim try to keep his 'wimping' situation secret and pretend that Dexter is Kim's little brother to Vaughn.\n\nAgain, as with Donkey Kong, Ruby-Spears took artistic license; in the video game, Dexter had certain chances to revert to Ace, his full-grown self, whereas in the cartoon the Ace/Dexter phases seemed to happen on their own and often at inconvenient times for the hero.\n\nIt was aired late night on [[Cartoon Network]] in the late 1990s, and segments have been shown between programs on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Cute Groots\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"Cosmic Camp Catastrophe\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"Dangerous Decoy\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"Moon Missile Madness\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"Perilous Partners\" (October 6, 1984)\n# \"Frozen in Fear\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"Age Ray Riot\" (October 20, 1984)\n# \"Wanted: Dexter!\" (October 27, 1984)\n# \"Phantom Shuttle\" (November 3, 1984)\n# \"Spoiled Sports\" (November 10, 1984)\n# \"Calamity Kimmie\" (November 17, 1984)\n# \"Three-Ring Rampage\" (November 24, 1984)\n# \"Infanto Fury\" (December 1, 1984)\n\n===Kangaroo===\nJoey [[Kangaroo]] (voiced by [[David Mendenhall]]), his mother [[Kangaroo (video game)|\"K.O.\" Katy Kangaroo]] (voiced by [[Mea Martineau]]) and Sidney [[Squirrel]] (voiced by [[Marvin Kaplan]]) must stop the Monkeybiz Gang members Bingo, Bango, Bongo, and Fred (all four voiced by [[Pat Fraley]] and Frank Welker), four meddlesome [[monkey]]s who are known from making trouble at the local zoo run by the [[zookeeper]] Mr. Friendly (voiced by [[Arthur Burghardt]]). The Monkeybiz Gang would cause trouble by trying to escape from the zoo and Katy would have to help keep them in line.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Trunkfull of Trouble\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"Zoo for Hire\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"Bat's Incredible\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"The White Squirrel of Dover\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"The Birthday Party\" (October 6, 1984)\n# \"Having a Ball\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"The Tail of the Cowardly Lion\" (October 20, 1984)\n# \"It's Carnival Time\" (October 27, 1984)\n# \"Lost and Found\" (November 3, 1984)\n# \"Joey and the Beanstalk\" (November 10, 1984)\n# \"Zoo's Who\" (November 17, 1984)\n# \"The Egg and Us\" (November 24, 1984)\n# \"The Runaway Panda\" (December 1, 1984)\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Soupy Sales]] - Donkey Kong\n* [[Dick Beals]] - Q*Bit\n* [[Billy Bowles]] - Q*bert\n* [[Bart Braverman]] - Bones\n* [[Arthur Burghardt]] - Borf, Mr. Friendly\n* [[Nancy Cartwright]] - Kimberly\n* [[Peter Cullen]] - Mario\n* [[Ted Field, Sr.|Ted Field Sr.]] - Tex\n* [[Pat Fraley]] - Bingo\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] - Shellshock \"Shelly\" Turtle, Sidney Squirrel\n* Robbie Lee - Q*Tee, Q*Val\n* [[Sparky Marcus]] - Dexter\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] - Quickclaw the Mountain Lion\n* [[Mea Martineau]] - \"K.O.\" Katy Kangaroo\n* [[Julie McWhirter]] - Q*bertha, Q*Mom, Viper\n* [[David Mendenhall]] - Joey Kangaroo\n* [[Noelle North]] - Rhonda\n* [[Jim Piper (actor)|Jim Piper]] - Space Ace\n* [[Peter Renaday]] - Space Marshall Vaughn, Legrin\n* [[Robert Ridgely]] - Pitfall Harry\n* [[Bob Sarlatte]] - Frogger\n* [[Judy Strangis]] - Pauline\n* [[B.

It ran for two seasons on [[CBS]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=530-531}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nEach episode is composed of several shorter segments featuring [[video game]] characters from the [[golden age of arcade video games]].\n\nThe segments included:\n\n* Frogger (from the ''[[Frogger]]'' arcade game)\n* [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] with [[Mario]] and [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] (from the ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game)\n* Donkey Kong Jr. (from the ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' arcade game)\n* Q*bert with Coily, Ugg, Wrongway, Slick and Sam (from the ''[[Q*bert]]'' arcade game)\n* Pitfall Harry with his pet [[Cougar|mountain lion]] Quickclaw and his niece Rhonda (unlike the others which are arcade games, this segment is from the [[video game console|home console]] game ''[[Pitfall!]]''). The cartoon was simply called \"Pitfall!\".\n\nPitfall! and Q*bert rotated weekly while the other three were weekly.\n\nDuring the second season, Q*bert (now weekly) and Donkey Kong remained while the Frogger, Donkey Kong Jr. and Pitfall! segments were replaced by shorts featuring:\n\n* Space Ace with Space Ace/Dexter (depending on his form), Kimberly, and Borf (from the ''[[Space Ace]]'' arcade game).\n* Kangaroo with friends and the \"Monkey Business Gang\" (from the ''[[Kangaroo (video game)|Kangaroo]]'' arcade game).\n\n==Segments==\n===Frogger===\n[[Frogger]] (voiced by [[Bob Sarlatte]]) is an ace [[Journalist|reporter]] of the swamp who works at ''The Swamp Gazette''. He and his friends Shellshock \"Shelly\" [[Turtle]] (voiced by [[Marvin Kaplan]]) and Fanny [[Frog]] (voiced by [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]]) go out in search of crazy stories (sometimes about human behavior) to publish in the newspaper. Frogger also has to deal with his gruff boss and [[editor-in-chief]] Tex Toadwalker (voiced by [[Ted Field, Sr.]]). As in the game, he often has an encounter with an [[alligator]] or gets flattened by a passing car.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"The Ms. Fortune Story\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Spaced Out Frogs\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"The Who-Took-Toadwalker Story\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"Hydrofoil & Seek\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"The Great Scuba Scoop\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"The Headline Hunters\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"The Legs Croaker Story\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"The Blackboard Bungle\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"Good Knight, Frogger\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"Fake Me Out to the Ball Game\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"I Remember Mummy\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Here Today, Pawned Tomorrow\" (December 3, 1983)\n# \"Hop-Along Frogger\" (December 10, 1983)\n\n===Donkey Kong===\n[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] (voiced by [[Soupy Sales]]) has escaped from the circus. He is on the lam, and [[Mario]] (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) and Pauline (voiced by [[Judy Strangis]]) are chasing the ape. As with the original game, Donkey Kong will often grab Pauline and Mario has to save her. Plots typically centered on them encountering crime with the villains conning the slow-witted Donkey Kong into doing their work and Mario and Pauline exposing the truth. After Mario and Pauline reveal the truth to Donkey Kong, the three of them team up to stop the antagonists' plans followed by Donkey Kong evading Mario and Pauline again.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Mississippi Madness\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Gorilla Gangster\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"Banana Bikers\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"The Incredible Shrinking Ape\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"Movie Mania\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"Gorilla My Dreams\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"Little Orphan Apey\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"Circus Daze\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"The Great Ape Escape\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"Apey and the Snowbeast\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"How Much is That Gorilla in the Window?\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Private Donkey Kong\" (December 3, 1983)\n# \"Get Along Little Apey\" (December 10, 1983)\n# \"Sir Donkey Kong\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"The Pale Whale\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"El Donkey Kong\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"New Wave Ape\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"Greenhouse Gorilla\" (October 6, 1984;This episode pays homage to Donkey Kong 3)\n# \"Hairy Parent\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"Gorilla on the trail\" (December 1,1984)\n\n===Q*bert===\nIn a 1950s-inspired world set in the town of Q*Berg, a teenage fur-covered creature named [[Q*bert]] (voiced by [[Billy Bowles]]), his girlfriend Q*Tee (voiced by Robbie Lee), his brother Q*Bit (voiced by [[Dick Beals]]), and his friends Q*Ball (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), Q*Val (voiced by Robbie Lee), and Q*Mongus (voiced by Frank Welker) must deal with the resident [[Bullying|bullies]] Coily, Ugg and Wrongway (all three voiced by Frank Welker), and Coily's girlfriend Viper (voiced by [[Julie McWhirter]]). As with the [[Q*Bert|video game]], the segment features \"block-hopping\" scenes, \"swearing\" bubbles and occasional flying discs from the original game. New to the cartoon was Q*bert's use of \"slippy-doos,\" a black ball projectile which he loaded and fired through his nose, producing an oil slick wherever the balls splattered. Slick and Sam (both voiced by Frank Welker) are also featured.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Disc Derby Fiasco\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"The Great Q*Tee Contest\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"Q*Ball Rigamarole\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"Crazy Camp Creature\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"Thanksgiving for the Memories\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Dog Day Dilemma\" (December 10, 1983)\n# \"Take Me Out to the Q*Game\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"Noser P.I.\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"Hook, Line, and Mermaid\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"[[Q*Historic Days]]\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"Q*bert's Monster Mix-Up\" (October 6, 1984)\n# \"Game Shoe Woe\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"The Wacky Q*Bot\" (October 20, 1984)\n# \"Q*Beat It\" (October 27, 1984)\n# \"Q*Urf's Up\" (November 3, 1984)\n# \"Little Green Nosers\" (November 10, 1984)\n# \"Rebel Without a Q*Ause\" (November 17, 1984)\n# \"Looking For Miss Q*Right\" (November 24, 1984)\n# \"The Goofy Ghostgetters\" (December 1, 1984)\n\n===Donkey Kong Jr.===\n[[Donkey Kong Jr.]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is sad to find that his father has run away from Mario and the circus. He befriends a [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] nicknamed \"Bones\" (voiced by [[Bart Braverman]]) who has a motorcycle and offers to help Junior by finding his dad together. Donkey Kong Jr's catchphrase is \"Monkey muscle!\", which he tells to himself and Bones to inspire self-confidence. Bones often serves as the voice of reason when Donkey Kong Jr. bites off more than he can chew.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Trucknapper Caper\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Sheep Rustle Hustle\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"Rocky Mountain Monkey Business\" (October 1, 1983)\n# \"Magnificent 7-Year-Olds\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"The Ventriloquist Caper\" (October 15, 1983)\n# \"The Great Seal Steal\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"The Jungle Boy Ploy\" (October 29, 1983)\n# \"Junior Meets Kid Dynamo\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"Amazing Rollerskate Race\" (November 12, 1983)\n# \"A Christmas Story\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"Gorilla Ghost\" (November 26, 1983)\n# \"Teddy Bear Scare\" (December 3, 1983)\n# \"Double or Nothing\" (December 10, 1983)\n\n===Pitfall!===\n[[Pitfall!|Pitfall Harry]] (voiced by [[Robert Ridgely]]), his niece Rhonda (voiced by [[Noelle North]]), and their cowardly pet Quickclaw the [[Cougar|Mountain Lion]] (voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]) explore jungles for hidden treasures, having many different adventures along the way. Quickclaw and Rhonda later appeared in ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]'' and ''[[Super Pitfall]]''.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Pitfall's Panda Puzzle\" (September 17, 1983)\n# \"Amazon Jungle Bungle\" (September 24, 1983)\n# \"Raiders of the Lost Shark\" (October 8, 1983)\n# \"Tibetan Treasure Trouble\" (October 22, 1983)\n# \"Masked Menace Mess\" (November 5, 1983)\n# \"The Sabretooth Goof\" (November 19, 1983)\n# \"The Pyramid Panic\" (December 3, 1983)\n\n===Space Ace===\n[[Space Ace]] (voiced by [[Jim Piper (actor)|Jim Piper]]) is the always smiling self-confident champion of the \"Space Command\", whereas when always \"wimping out\" to Dexter (voiced by [[Sparky Marcus]]) after being hit by the Infanto-Ray, he becomes clumsy and weak. With officer Kimberly (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]), he works for Space Marshall Vaughn (voiced by [[Peter Renaday]]) to keep the peace in the universe. They fight the evil alien commander Borf (voiced by [[Arthur Burghardt]]) and keep him from invading Earth. Ace and Kim try to keep his 'wimping' situation secret and pretend that Dexter is Kim's little brother to Vaughn.\n\nAgain, as with Donkey Kong, Ruby-Spears took artistic license; in the video game, Dexter had certain chances to revert to Ace, his full-grown self, whereas in the cartoon the Ace/Dexter phases seemed to happen on their own and often at inconvenient times for the hero.\n\nIt was aired late night on [[Cartoon Network]] in the late 1990s, and segments have been shown between programs on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Cute Groots\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"Cosmic Camp Catastrophe\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"Dangerous Decoy\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"Moon Missile Madness\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"Perilous Partners\" (October 6, 1984)\n# \"Frozen in Fear\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"Age Ray Riot\" (October 20, 1984)\n# \"Wanted: Dexter!\" (October 27, 1984)\n# \"Phantom Shuttle\" (November 3, 1984)\n# \"Spoiled Sports\" (November 10, 1984)\n# \"Calamity Kimmie\" (November 17, 1984)\n# \"Three-Ring Rampage\" (November 24, 1984)\n# \"Infanto Fury\" (December 1, 1984)\n\n===Kangaroo===\nJoey [[Kangaroo]] (voiced by [[David Mendenhall]]), his mother [[Kangaroo (video game)|\"K.O.\" Katy Kangaroo]] (voiced by [[Mea Martineau]]) and Sidney [[Squirrel]] (voiced by [[Marvin Kaplan]]) must stop the Monkeybiz Gang members Bingo, Bango, Bongo, and Fred (all four voiced by [[Pat Fraley]] and Frank Welker), four meddlesome [[monkey]]s who are known from making trouble at the local zoo run by the [[zookeeper]] Mr. Friendly (voiced by [[Arthur Burghardt]]). The Monkeybiz Gang would cause trouble by trying to escape from the zoo and Katy would have to help keep them in line.\n\n====Episodes====\n# \"Trunkfull of Trouble\" (September 8, 1984)\n# \"Zoo for Hire\" (September 15, 1984)\n# \"Bat's Incredible\" (September 22, 1984)\n# \"The White Squirrel of Dover\" (September 29, 1984)\n# \"The Birthday Party\" (October 6, 1984)\n# \"Having a Ball\" (October 13, 1984)\n# \"The Tail of the Cowardly Lion\" (October 20, 1984)\n# \"It's Carnival Time\" (October 27, 1984)\n# \"Lost and Found\" (November 3, 1984)\n# \"Joey and the Beanstalk\" (November 10, 1984)\n# \"Zoo's Who\" (November 17, 1984)\n# \"The Egg and Us\" (November 24, 1984)\n# \"The Runaway Panda\" (December 1, 1984)\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Soupy Sales]] - Donkey Kong\n* [[Dick Beals]] - Q*Bit\n* [[Billy Bowles]] - Q*bert\n* [[Bart Braverman]] - Bones\n* [[Arthur Burghardt]] - Borf, Mr. Friendly\n* [[Nancy Cartwright]] - Kimberly\n* [[Peter Cullen]] - Mario\n* [[Ted Field, Sr.|Ted Field Sr.]] - Tex\n* [[Pat Fraley]] - Bingo\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] - Shellshock \"Shelly\" Turtle, Sidney Squirrel\n* Robbie Lee - Q*Tee, Q*Val\n* [[Sparky Marcus]] - Dexter\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] - Quickclaw the Mountain Lion\n* [[Mea Martineau]] - \"K.O.\" Katy Kangaroo\n* [[Julie McWhirter]] - Q*bertha, Q*Mom, Viper\n* [[David Mendenhall]] - Joey Kangaroo\n* [[Noelle North]] - Rhonda\n* [[Jim Piper (actor)|Jim Piper]] - Space Ace\n* [[Peter Renaday]] - Space Marshall Vaughn, Legrin\n* [[Robert Ridgely]] - Pitfall Harry\n* [[Bob Sarlatte]] - Frogger\n* [[Judy Strangis]] - Pauline\n* [[B.

It has spread, in a limited way, to neighbouring countries such as [[Uruguay]]. Every year since its inception in 1840, miracles are said to have occurred at the shrine of La Difunta Correa, and thousands of people have visited there to pay their respects. The shrine is situated in the small town of Vallecito, 1160&nbsp;km from Buenos Aires and 63&nbsp;km from the city of San Juan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sacredsites.com/americas/argentina/difunta_correa.html|title=Difunta Correa|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Birth of a popular saint==\nAccording to popular legend, the husband of Deolinda Correa was forcibly recruited around the year 1840, during the Argentine civil wars. When he became sick, he was abandoned by the ''[[Montoneras]]'' [partisans]. In an attempt to reach her sick husband, Deolinda took her baby and followed the tracks of the ''Montoneras'' through the desert of [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan Province]]. When her supplies ran out, she died. Her body was found days later by [[gauchos]] who were driving cattle through. They were astonished when they saw the dead woman's baby was still alive, feeding from her  \"miraculously\" ever-full breast. The men buried her body in present-day [[Vallecito, San Juan|Vallecito]] in the [[Caucete Department]] of San Juan, and took her baby with them.\n\n==Sanctuary==\n[[File:Difunta Correa shrine.jpg|thumb|upright|Votive chapel to Difunta Correa at Vallecito]]\nOnce the folk tale became known, the inhabitants of the nearby areas started visiting Deolinda Correa's grave, building after time an oratory that slowly became a sanctuary.\n\nThe [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] to the ''Difunta Correa'' is that of an unofficial popular saint, not recognised by the [[Catholic Church]]. Her devout followers believe her to perform miracles and intercede for the living. The survival of her child would have been her first miracle.\n\n[[File:Roadside shrine to Difunta Corea.jpg|thumb|left|Roadside shrine in the Andes to Difunta Corea]]\nCattle keepers first, then truck drivers, disseminated the figure of the Difunta, creating [[wayside shrine]]s in many roads throughout the country, with images and sculptures of the ''Deceased''. They there leave bottles of water as [[votive offering]]s, \"to calm her eternal thirst\".\n\nSince the 1940s her sanctuary at Vallecito, at first merely a cross on the top of a hill, has been transformed into a small town in which there are several votive chapels (17 as of 2005), full of offerings. The chapels are donated by her followers, whose names are engraved on plates fixed to the doors.\n\nIn the chapel located on the top of the hill there is a life-size statue depicting the ''Difunta'' lying face to the heavens, with her child at her breast. The sanctuaries are segregated by themes. For instance, one of the chapels is full of wedding dresses offered to the ''Difunta'' by women whose prayers to get married were fulfilled. Car registrations and scale-model houses can be found all around the hill to the main sanctuary.\n\nVisits to the Difunta Correa's Vallecito shrine take place during the whole year, but they are more numerous during Easter or at [[All-Souls' Day]] (2 November) and on dates special to truck drivers and gauchos, mostly in summer. On such occasions, crowds of 200,000 people have been claimed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Religion in Argentina#Popular cults]]\n*[[Miguel \u00c1ngel Gait\u00e1n]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*\"[http://itotd.com/articles/441/the-legend-of-deolinda-correa/ The Legend of Deolinda Correa Unofficial saint of the desert]\", [[Joe Kissell]], ''[[Interesting Thing of the Day]]'', 26 January 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Difunta Correa}}\n*[http://www.visitedifuntacorrea.com.ar/ Difunta Correa's official site] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.cuco.com.ar/difunta_correa.htm Difunta Correa: Dictionary of Myths and Legends] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.culturesofdevotion.com \"Cultures of Devotion by Frank Graziano\"], academic website with images relating to Difunto Correa and other Spanish American folk saints.

Car registrations and scale-model houses can be found all around the hill to the main sanctuary.\n\nVisits to the Difunta Correa's Vallecito shrine take place during the whole year, but they are more numerous during Easter or at [[All-Souls' Day]] (2 November) and on dates special to truck drivers and gauchos, mostly in summer. On such occasions, crowds of 200,000 people have been claimed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Religion in Argentina#Popular cults]]\n*[[Miguel \u00c1ngel Gait\u00e1n]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*\"[http://itotd.com/articles/441/the-legend-of-deolinda-correa/ The Legend of Deolinda Correa Unofficial saint of the desert]\", [[Joe Kissell]], ''[[Interesting Thing of the Day]]'', 26 January 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Difunta Correa}}\n*[http://www.visitedifuntacorrea.com.ar/ Difunta Correa's official site] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.cuco.com.ar/difunta_correa.htm Difunta Correa: Dictionary of Myths and Legends] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.culturesofdevotion.com \"Cultures of Devotion by Frank Graziano\"], academic website with images relating to Difunto Correa and other Spanish American folk saints.
