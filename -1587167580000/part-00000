The Medial epicondyle is the non-articular medial bulge of bone located superior and medial to the trochlea. The medial epicondyle is more prominent than the lateral epicondyle and the ulnar collateral ligament is attached here along with the forearm flexors.\n\n[[File:Medial-epicondyle-and-lateral-epicondyle.jpg|none|thumb|400x400px|Medial and Lateral epicondyles of the Humerus]]\n\n[[File:Medial-supracondylar-crest-and-lateral-supracondylar-crest.jpg|none|thumb|400x400px|Medial and lateral supracondylar ridges of the Humerus]]\n\nThe Medial supracondylar crest forms the sharp medial border of the distal humerus continuing superiorly from the medial epicondyle.

More distally, at the elbow, the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the head of the [[radius (bone)|radius]], and the [[Trochlea of humerus|trochlea of the humerus]] articulates with the trochlear notch of the [[ulna]].\n\n{{Gallery|lines=3\n |Image:Shoulder joint.svg|Diagram of the human [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]], front view\n |File:Shoulder joint back-en.svg|Diagram of the human shoulder joint, back view\n |Image:Gray326.png|The left shoulder and [[acromioclavicular joint]]s, and the proper ligaments of the scapula.\n |File:Slide4KKKK.JPG|Head of humerus\n |Image:Gray420.png|The [[Supinator muscle|supinator]].\n}}\n\n===Nerves===\nThe [[axillary nerve]] is located at the proximal end, against the shoulder girdle. Dislocation of the humerus's [[glenohumeral joint]] has the potential to injure the axillary nerve or the [[axillary artery]]. Signs and symptoms of this dislocation include a loss of the normal shoulder contour and a palpable depression under the acromion.\n\nThe [[radial nerve]] follows the humerus closely. At the midshaft of the humerus, the radial nerve travels from the posterior to the anterior aspect of the bone in the ''spiral groove''. A fracture of the humerus in this region can result in radial nerve injury.\n\nThe [[ulnar nerve]] lies at the distal end of the humerus near the elbow. When struck, it can cause a distinct tingling sensation, and sometimes a significant amount of pain. It is sometimes popularly referred to as 'the funny bone', possibly due to this sensation (a \"funny\" feeling), as well as the fact that the bone's name is a homophone of 'humorous'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/2012/01/funny-bone/|website=Word Detective|title = ''Funny Bone''}}</ref> It lies posterior to the medial epicondyle, and is easily damaged in elbow injuries.{{Citation needed|reason=The original link was broken.|date=March 2017}}\n{{Gallery\n |Image:Gray413 color.png|[[Horizontal section]] at the middle of [[upper arm]]. \n |File:Slide8B.JPG|Horizontal section of upper arm.\n |File:Slide1dj.JPG|Humerus\n}}\n\n==Function==\n\n===Muscular attachment===\nThe [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] originates on the lateral third of the [[clavicle]], [[acromion]] and the crest of the [[spine of scapula|spine]] of the scapula. It is inserted on the [[deltoid tuberosity]] of the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and circumduction of the shoulder. The [[supraspinatus]] also originates on the spine of the scapula. It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of the shoulder.\n\nThe [[pectoralis major]], [[teres major]], and [[latissimus dorsi]] insert at the ''intertubercular groove'' of the humerus. They work to adduct and medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe [[infraspinatus]] and [[teres minor]] insert on the greater tubercle, and work to laterally, or externally, rotate the humerus. In contrast, the [[subscapularis]] muscle inserts onto the lesser tubercle and works to medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe [[biceps brachii]], [[brachialis]], and [[brachioradialis]] (which attaches distally) act to flex the elbow. (The biceps do not attach to the humerus.) The [[triceps brachii]] and [[anconeus]] extend the elbow, and attach to the posterior side of the humerus.\n\nThe four muscles of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis form a musculo-ligamentous girdle called the [[rotator cuff]]. This cuff stabilizes the very mobile but inherently unstable [[glenohumeral joint]]. The other muscles are used as counterbalances for the actions of lifting/pulling and pressing/pushing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Left humerus.

More distally, at the elbow, the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the head of the [[radius (bone)|radius]], and the [[Trochlea of humerus|trochlea of the humerus]] articulates with the trochlear notch of the [[ulna]].\n\n{{Gallery|lines=3\n |Image:Shoulder joint.svg|Diagram of the human [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]], front view\n |File:Shoulder joint back-en.svg|Diagram of the human shoulder joint, back view\n |Image:Gray326.png|The left shoulder and [[acromioclavicular joint]]s, and the proper ligaments of the scapula.\n |File:Slide4KKKK.JPG|Head of humerus\n |Image:Gray420.png|The [[Supinator muscle|supinator]].\n}}\n\n===Nerves===\nThe [[axillary nerve]] is located at the proximal end, against the shoulder girdle. Dislocation of the humerus's [[glenohumeral joint]] has the potential to injure the axillary nerve or the [[axillary artery]]. Signs and symptoms of this dislocation include a loss of the normal shoulder contour and a palpable depression under the acromion.\n\nThe [[radial nerve]] follows the humerus closely. At the midshaft of the humerus, the radial nerve travels from the posterior to the anterior aspect of the bone in the ''spiral groove''. A fracture of the humerus in this region can result in radial nerve injury.\n\nThe [[ulnar nerve]] lies at the distal end of the humerus near the elbow. When struck, it can cause a distinct tingling sensation, and sometimes a significant amount of pain. It is sometimes popularly referred to as 'the funny bone', possibly due to this sensation (a \"funny\" feeling), as well as the fact that the bone's name is a homophone of 'humorous'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/2012/01/funny-bone/|website=Word Detective|title = ''Funny Bone''}}</ref> It lies posterior to the medial epicondyle, and is easily damaged in elbow injuries.{{Citation needed|reason=The original link was broken.|date=March 2017}}\n{{Gallery\n |Image:Gray413 color.png|[[Horizontal section]] at the middle of [[upper arm]]. \n |File:Slide8B.JPG|Horizontal section of upper arm.\n |File:Slide1dj.JPG|Humerus\n}}\n\n==Function==\n\n===Muscular attachment===\nThe [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] originates on the lateral third of the [[clavicle]], [[acromion]] and the crest of the [[spine of scapula|spine]] of the scapula. It is inserted on the [[deltoid tuberosity]] of the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and circumduction of the shoulder. The [[supraspinatus]] also originates on the spine of the scapula. It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of the shoulder.\n\nThe [[pectoralis major]], [[teres major]], and [[latissimus dorsi]] insert at the ''intertubercular groove'' of the humerus. They work to adduct and medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe [[infraspinatus]] and [[teres minor]] insert on the greater tubercle, and work to laterally, or externally, rotate the humerus. In contrast, the [[subscapularis]] muscle inserts onto the lesser tubercle and works to medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe [[biceps brachii]], [[brachialis]], and [[brachioradialis]] (which attaches distally) act to flex the elbow. (The biceps do not attach to the humerus.) The [[triceps brachii]] and [[anconeus]] extend the elbow, and attach to the posterior side of the humerus.\n\nThe four muscles of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis form a musculo-ligamentous girdle called the [[rotator cuff]]. This cuff stabilizes the very mobile but inherently unstable [[glenohumeral joint]]. The other muscles are used as counterbalances for the actions of lifting/pulling and pressing/pushing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Left humerus.

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos.

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\n{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.\n\n==Indigenous rights and other issues==\n{{Indigenous rights}}\n\n[[File:NZ delegation UN Forum on Indigenous Issues.jpg|thumb|left|alt=endorses Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, 2010|The New Zealand delegation, including [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] members, endorses the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] in 2010.]]\n\nIndigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practised by the Meriam people.\n\nA 2009 United Nations publication says \"''Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of [[cultural diversity]] as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.\"''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Human rights violations===\n\nThe Bangladesh Government has stated that there are \"no indigenous peoples in Bangladesh.\"<ref name=\"Shafiq\">[http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198775&cid=3 No 'indigenous', reiterates Shafique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319055434/http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198775&cid=3 |date=19 March 2012 }}. bdnews24.com (18 June 2011).

Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples|title=Indigenous Peoples|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\n{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia.

Some philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588-1679), considered indigenous people to be merely \"savages\". Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularised the concept of \"[[noble savage]]s\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to \"civilize\" and \"modernize\" the indigenous.

Unsustainable development projects such as dam construction and resource extraction have displaced large numbers of indigenous peoples, often without providing compensation. Governments have forced indigenous peoples off of their native lands in the name of [[ecotourism]] and national park development. Indigenous women are especially affected by land dispossession because they must walk longer distances for water and fuel wood.

Schaefer's position with the Royals was terminated at the end of the 2005 season, the worst in Royals history.\n\nHe began his managerial career in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], where he won numerous awards. He was twice named Manager of the Year (in 1980 and 1981) at Class A [[Greensboro Grasshoppers|Greensboro]], then a part of the [[New York Yankees]] organization. He also managed the [[New York Mets]]' Class AAA team in [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater]] to an [[International League]] championship in 1985.\n\nHe first joined the Royals organization in 1987, managing the Class AA [[Memphis Chicks]]. His first major-league job was as the Royals' [[Coach (baseball)|first base coach]] from 1988 to 1990, then he was the Royals' bench coach in 1991. He worked as a special assignment scout with the Royals in 1992.\n\nSchaefer then moved on to the [[Boston Red Sox]] organization, serving as a special assignment scout and later the director of player development from 1994 to the midseason of 1998. During that time, he hired [[Bob Geren]] as a manager in the Boston farm system; a decade later, when Geren was named the 2007 manager of the [[Oakland Athletics]], he brought Schaefer to Oakland as bench coach on his staff.\n\nAlthough Schaefer received positive notices for his work as the Red Sox' player development chief, he clashed with [[general manager]] [[Dan Duquette]] and was fired during the summer of 1998; several minor league managers and coaches, including Geren, departed the organization with Schaefer, who spent the next three years as a special assistant to the general manager of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] before returning to the Royals in 2001 as a bench coach and infielders coach.\n\nAfter his 2005 departure from Kansas City, he spent 2006 as a special assignment [[scout (sport)|scout]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]].  He was bench coach for the [[Oakland Athletics]] in 2007, and was named to the same role for the Dodgers and its new manager, [[Joe Torre]], for the 2008 season, a role he held through 2010. After Torre's retirement, Schaefer announced he would not return on the staff of incoming manager [[Don Mattingly]], saying that he thought Mattingly should pick a younger coach who could continue for a number of years.<ref>[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101003&content_id=15382160&notebook_id=15402778&vkey=notebook_la&c_id=la Dodgers' coaching staff uncertain for 2011]</ref>\n\nHis career record as an MLB manager is 6\u201312 (.333), including his 5\u201312 mark during his 2005 tenure.\n\n==Managerial records==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"4\"|Regular Season !! colspan=\"4\"|Post Season\n|-\n!

W. Woolworth Company|F. W. Woolworth]] [[retail chain]] became the first customer for Newell's [[bronze]]&ndash;[[plating|plated]] curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, New York.\n\nThe company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Illinois in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nDuring World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy \"E\" award for excellence in wartime production.\n\n[[Daniel C. Ferguson]] was named president in 1965, and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.\n\nThe Newell Company [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974, they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of [[paint]] [[paint brush|applicator]]s. Newell was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Illinois.\n\nIn 1983, the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of [[Mirro]]. In 1987, the company acquired [[Anchor Hocking]] Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of [[Amerock]], a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1992, they acquired [[Sanford L.P.|Sanford]], a manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men's grooming accessories.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1997, the company acquired Kirsch, a company involved with [[drapery]] hardware and custom [[window covering]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1998, the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of cookware marketed primarily to [[luxury good|upscale]] retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, a cookware maker operating in South America.\n\nIn 2016, Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2018/04/this_nj-based_company_just_got_named_most_reputabl.html This N.J.-based company just got named most reputable in U.S.]</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nNewell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen (relocating them to Nantes, France, and China)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischier|first1=Tony|title=A rendezvous with History A visit to the legendary Parker Archives|url=https://parkerpens.net/archives-1.html|website=parkerpens.net|publisher=Parker Pens Archives|accessdate=14 October 2017|date=4 June 2009}}</ref> as well as toolmakers Berol, Record and Marples.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duke|first1=Te|title=Vanished Tool Makers: William Marples & Sons, Sheffield, England|url=http://progress-is-fine.blogspot.com/2013/03/vanished-tool-makers-william-marples.html|website=Progress is fine, but it's gone on for too long.|accessdate=14 October 2017|date=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nNewell Sistema  products has been criticized for requiring workers in their Auckland, New Zealand factory to work in unsafe conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak and lock down without adequate distances between workers and proper personal protective equipment.

This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of brands. \n\nAccording to the November 10, 2004 ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary series' \"Is Wal-Mart Good for America?\" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and [[fire sale]]-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products, shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality.\n\nDespite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart, citing its strict commitment to its \"everyday low price\" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHowever, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the \"merger from hell\" by ''[[Bloomberg Business|Businessweek]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-10-19/newell-rubbermaid-why-itll-bounce-back|title=Newell Rubbermaid: Why It'll Bounce Back|date=Oct 19, 2003|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=Business Week}}</ref> Newell [[shareholder]]s lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell [[Write-off|wrote off]] $500 million in goodwill.\n\n===Other mergers===\nIn 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]'s stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and [[Liquid Paper]] brands.\n\nIn 2002, they acquired [[Irwin Industrial Tools|American Tool Companies]], adding the Irwin, [[Vise-Grip]], and Marathon brands to their portfolio.\n\nIn 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[American Saw and Manufacturing Company]], a manufacturer of linear-edge [[power tool]] accessories, hand tools, and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.\n\nIn 2005, the company acquired [[DYMO Corporation|DYMO]], designing, manufacturing, and marketing on-demand labeling [[solution]]s. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage company Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO.  The company added the slogan of \"Brands That Matter\" to their [[logo]] to emphasize the change.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats, and other children's products and Technical Concepts, in the away-from-home restroom{{what|date=September 2018}} market.

W. Woolworth Company|F. W. Woolworth]] [[retail chain]] became the first customer for Newell's [[bronze]]&ndash;[[plating|plated]] curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, New York.\n\nThe company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Illinois in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nDuring World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy \"E\" award for excellence in wartime production.\n\n[[Daniel C. Ferguson]] was named president in 1965, and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.\n\nThe Newell Company [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974, they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of [[paint]] [[paint brush|applicator]]s. Newell was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Illinois.\n\nIn 1983, the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of [[Mirro]]. In 1987, the company acquired [[Anchor Hocking]] Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of [[Amerock]], a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1992, they acquired [[Sanford L.P.|Sanford]], a manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men's grooming accessories.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1997, the company acquired Kirsch, a company involved with [[drapery]] hardware and custom [[window covering]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1998, the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of cookware marketed primarily to [[luxury good|upscale]] retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, a cookware maker operating in South America.\n\nIn 2016, Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2018/04/this_nj-based_company_just_got_named_most_reputabl.html This N.J.-based company just got named most reputable in U.S.]</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nNewell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen (relocating them to Nantes, France and China)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischier|first1=Tony|title=A rendezvous with History A visit to the legendary Parker Archives|url=https://parkerpens.net/archives-1.html|website=parkerpens.net|publisher=Parker Pens Archives|accessdate=14 October 2017|date=4 June 2009}}</ref> as well as toolmakers Berol, Record and Marples.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duke|first1=Te|title=Vanished Tool Makers: William Marples & Sons, Sheffield, England|url=http://progress-is-fine.blogspot.com/2013/03/vanished-tool-makers-william-marples.html|website=Progress is fine, but it's gone on for too long.|accessdate=14 October 2017|date=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nNewell Sistema  products has been criticized for requiring workers in their Auckland, New Zealand factory to work in unsafe conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak and lock down without adequate distances between workers and proper personal protective equipment.

This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of brands. \n\nAccording to the November 10, 2004 ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary series' \"Is Wal-Mart Good for America?\" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and [[fire sale]]-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products, shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality.\n\nDespite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart, citing its strict commitment to its \"everyday low price\" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHowever, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the \"merger from hell\" by ''[[Bloomberg Business|Businessweek]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-10-19/newell-rubbermaid-why-itll-bounce-back|title=Newell Rubbermaid: Why It'll Bounce Back|date=Oct 19, 2003|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=Business Week}}</ref> Newell [[shareholder]]s lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell [[Write-off|wrote off]] $500 million in goodwill.\n\n===Other mergers===\nIn 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]'s stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and [[Liquid Paper]] brands.\n\nIn 2002, they acquired [[Irwin Industrial Tools|American Tool Companies]], adding the Irwin, [[Vise-Grip]], and Marathon brands to their portfolio.\n\nIn 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[American Saw and Manufacturing Company]], a manufacturer of linear-edge [[power tool]] accessories, hand tools, and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.\n\nIn 2005, the company acquired [[DYMO Corporation|DYMO]], designing, manufacturing, and marketing on-demand labeling [[solution]]s. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage company Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO.  The company added the slogan of \"Brands That Matter\" to their [[logo]] to emphasize the change.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats, and other children's products and Technical Concepts, in the away-from-home restroom{{what|date=September 2018}} market.

While buses are inside stations, the coaches operate solely on electric propulsion (although, while the doors are closed, the engine still rotates in order to operate auxiliary loads). In between the tunnel's stations, the bus uses electric traction to get to {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, after which a combination of the electric and diesel motors are used. The operation of the diesel engine allows the batteries to recharge.

The first trips took place in 1984, and nowadays MEHVA typically operates six to eight per year.<ref name=\"mehva-times\" /> Each excursion has a different route and a different emphasis.\n\nMEHVA was established in 1981, as Metro prepared to retire trolleybuses that had been operating in Seattle since the 1940s. Since that time, MEHVA acquired other retired transit vehicles which were formerly operated in King County. Often these retired coaches were purchased by private citizens and left on the owner's property for many decades, leaving them in need of restoration. The collection of vehicles has gradually expanded over time, with the addition of newly retired buses when deemed historically notable and not yet represented in the collection.\n\n== Current fleet roster ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These are common in [[Scotland]]. In the medieval [[Old Town, Edinburgh]], tenements were developed with each apartment treated as a separate house, built on top of each other (such as [[Gladstone's Land]]).

Perhaps the most striking case of this is seen in the [[Gorbals]] district, where virtually all the tenements were demolished to make way for tower blocks, which in turn have been demolished and replaced with newer structures. The Gorbals is a relatively small area and at one time had an estimated 90,000 people living in its tenements, leading to very poor living conditions; now the population is roughly 10,000.\n\nTenement demolition was to a significantly lesser extent in Edinburgh, thus making its later World Heritage designations in 1985 possible.

We have visited one house that we found to be occupied by 98 persons, another by 74 and a third by 73.\n\nThe entrance to all tenement houses is by a common door off either a street, lane or alley, and, in most cases, the door is never shut, day or night. The passages and stairs are common and the rooms all open directly either off the passages or landings.\n\nMost of these houses have yards at the back, some of which are a fair size, while others are very small, and some few houses have no yards at all. Generally, the only water supply of the house is furnished by a single water tap, which is in the yard. The yard is common and the closet accommodation [''toilet''] is to be found there, except in some few cases in which there is no yard, when it is to be found in the basement where there is little light or ventilation.\n\nThe closet accommodation is common not only to the occupants of the house, but to anyone who likes to come in off the street, and is, of course, common to both sexes. The roofs of the tenement houses are, as a rule, bad . . .\n\nHaving visited a large number of these houses in all parts of the city, we have no hesitation in saying that it is no uncommon thing to find halls and landings, yards and closets of the houses in a filthy condition, and, in nearly every case, human excreta is to be found scattered about the yards and in the floors of the closets and, in some cases, even in the passages of the house itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/life-in-the-tenements-was-hard-and-brutal-29780548.html|title=Life in the tenements was hard and brutal|website=independent}}</ref>}}\n\nTenement life often appeared in fiction, such as the \"Dublin trilogy\" of plays by [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]'s play ''[[Blight (play)|Blight]]'', and [[James Plunkett]]'s novel ''[[Strumpet City]]'' ([[Strumpet City (miniseries)|adapted for television]] in 1980).

Many chawl buildings can be found in [[Mumbai]], where chawls were constructed by the thousands to house people migrating to the large city because of its booming cotton mills and overall strong economy.\n\nA typical chawl tenement consists of one all-purpose room, which functions both as a living and sleeping space, and a kitchen which also serves as a dining room. A frequent practice is for the kitchen to also serve as a bedroom for a newly married couple in order to give them some degree of privacy.\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:Square Wroc\u0142aw 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Kamienice'' in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] Old Town, [[Market Square, Wroc\u0142aw|Market Square]]]]\n[[File:Warszawa -Star\u00f3wka - Rynek - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Tenements in Warsaw Old Town, Market Square]]\n'''''Kamienica''''' (plural ''kamienice'') is a [[Polish language|Polish]] term describing a type of residential tenement building made of brick or [[Masonry|stone]], with at least two floors. There are two basic types: one designed as a single-family residence, which existed until ca. 1800 (a burgher house), and the other designed as multi-family housing, which emerged in the 19th century and was the basic type of housing in cities. From the architectural point of view, the word is usually used to describe a building that abuts other similar buildings forming the street [[frontage]], in the manner of a [[terraced house]]. The ground floor often consists of shops and other businesses, while the upper floors are apartments. Kamienice have windows in the front, but not in the side walls, since the buildings are close together.  The first type of kamienica is most prevalent especially in centres of historical cities such as [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], and [[Toru\u0144]], whereas the second type is most prominent in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].

These are common in [[Scotland]]. In the medieval [[Old Town, Edinburgh]], tenements were developed with each apartment treated as a separate house, built on top of each other (such as [[Gladstone's Land]]). Over hundreds of years, customary law of tenements grew to allocate responsibilities for maintenance, as first formally discussed in [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Stair]]'s 1681 writings on [[Scots law]].<ref name=\"ReidZimmermann2000\">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth G.

As cities grew in the nineteenth century, there was increasing separation between rich and poor.

The New York State legislature defined it in the Tenement House Act of 1867 in terms of rental occupancy by multiple households, as\n\n{{quote|Any house, building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased, let, or hired out to be occupied or is occupied, as the home or residence of more than three families living independently of one another and doing their own cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon a floor, so living and cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies, or some of them.<ref>Quoted in Plunz, p. 167.</ref>|}}\n\nIn Scotland, it continues to be the most common word for a [[Apartment#Scotland|multiple-occupancy building]], but elsewhere it is used as a pejorative in contrast to ''[[apartment|apartment building]]'' or ''block of flats''.<ref>For example, Heller, Vivian.

Glasgow tenements were built to provide high-density housing for the large number of people immigrating to the city in the 19th and early 20th century as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]], when the city's population boomed to more than 1&nbsp;million people. Edinburgh's tenements are much older, dating from the 17th century onwards, and some were up to 15 storeys high when first built, which made them among the tallest houses in the world at that time.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ|title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh, from 1385 to 1824, including an account of the great fire of November, 1824 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Smith |year=1824 |last=Chambers |first=Robert |oclc=54265692 |page=11}}</ref> Glasgow tenements were generally built no taller than the width of the street on which they were located; therefore, most are about 3&ndash;5 storeys high. Virtually all Glasgow tenements were constructed using red or blonde sandstone, which has become distinctive.\n\nIn Edinburgh, residential dwellings in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Sites]] of the [[medieval]] [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] and [[Georgian era|Georgian]] [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] (as well as the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] city centre districts immediately surrounding them) are almost exclusively tenements.\nThe [[Tenement House (Glasgow)|Tenement House]] [[historic house museum]] in the [[Garnethill]] area of Glasgow preserves the interior, fittings and equipment of an  ordinary middle-class tenement from the late 19th century.  \n\nA large number of the tenements in Glasgow were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s because of slum conditions, overcrowding and poor maintenance of the buildings. Perhaps the most striking case of this is seen in the [[Gorbals]] district, where virtually all the tenements were demolished to make way for tower blocks, which in turn have been demolished and replaced with newer structures. The Gorbals is a relatively small area and at one time had an estimated 90,000 people living in its tenements, leading to very poor living conditions; now the population is roughly 10,000.\n\nTenement demolition was to a significantly lesser extent in Edinburgh, thus making its later World Heritage designations in 1985 possible. Largely, such clearances were limited to pre-Victorian buildings outwith the New Town area and were precipitated by the so-called \"Penny Tenement\" incident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/entertainment/the-penny-tenement-collapse-that-changed-edinburgh-forever-1-4386368|title=The 'Penny Tenement' collapse that changed Edinburgh forever|website=scotsman.com}}</ref>\n\nApartments in tenement buildings in both cities are now highly sought after, due to their locations and often large rooms, high ceilings, ornamentation and period features.\n\n===Berlin===\n[[File:Meyers Hof.jpg|thumb|left|Meyers Hof in Berlin, 1910]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-69536-0010, Berlin, Marienstra\u00dfe, Wohnhaus, Altbau.jpg|thumb|Members of a tenants' collective in front of their tenement building in [[East Berlin]] in 1959 (the fa\u00e7ade still pockmarked with [[battle in Berlin|1945 battle damage]])]]\nIn German, the term corresponding to ''tenement'' is ''Mietskaserne'', \"rental barracks\", and the city especially known for them is Berlin.

We have visited one house that we found to be occupied by 98 persons, another by 74 and a third by 73.\n\nThe entrance to all tenement houses is by a common door off either a street, lane or alley, and, in most cases, the door is never shut, day or night. The passages and stairs are common and the rooms all open directly either off the passages or landings.\n\nMost of these houses have yards at the back, some of which are a fair size, while others are very small, and some few houses have no yards at all. Generally, the only water supply of the house is furnished by a single water tap, which is in the yard. The yard is common and the closet accommodation [''toilet''] is to be found there, except in some few cases in which there is no yard, when it is to be found in the basement where there is little light or ventilation.\n\nThe closet accommodation is common not only to the occupants of the house, but to anyone who likes to come in off the street, and is, of course, common to both sexes.

There are two basic types: one designed as a single-family residence, which existed until ca. 1800 (a burgher house), and the other designed as multi-family housing, which emerged in the 19th century and was the basic type of housing in cities. From the architectural point of view, the word is usually used to describe a building that abuts other similar buildings forming the street [[frontage]], in the manner of a [[terraced house]]. The ground floor often consists of shops and other businesses, while the upper floors are apartments. Kamienice have windows in the front, but not in the side walls, since the buildings are close together.  The first type of kamienica is most prevalent especially in centres of historical cities such as [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], and [[Toru\u0144]], whereas the second type is most prominent in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].
