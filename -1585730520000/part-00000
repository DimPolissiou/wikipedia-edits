The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=00288624|volume=45 no. 1|number=194|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night. Wellington, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|The southern terminus of the North Island Main Trunk, [[Wellington railway station]], and busiest station in the Wellington suburban network.]]\n{{main|Public transport in Wellington}}\n\nWellington's Metlink suburban network, operated by [[Transdev Wellington]], includes the southern portion of the NIMT between [[Wellington railway station, New Zealand|Wellington]] and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] as the [[Kapiti Line]].\n\n==Stations==\n\n<ref>{{cite book|title=New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas|year=1965|publisher=Quail Map Co.|pages=3 & 4|edition=First}}</ref>{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=289\u2013290}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=00288624|volume=45 no. 1|number=194|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

Like ''Searching for El Dorado'', ''Bikini - mon amour'' reached an audience of millions when it was shown in prime time on German TV Channel 1 ([[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]). In 1985/86 Herbrich realized a documentary biopic with the Bavarian jail break king, [[Theo Berger]].

In 2018, Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf catalogued all written documents from the films.\n\n== Cinematic approach ==\n[[Dieter Kosslick]], former director of [[Berlin International Film Festival]] outlined Herbrich's working style as follows:\n\n\"Fortunately Oliver Herbrich doesn\u2019t create an ideology when walking the line between fictional movie and documentary film. Herbrich\u2019s approach is solely based on the storytelling needs of the subjects. Remarkably, this technique results in a combination of documentary and fictional elements. There\u2019s one scene sequence during the ''Mathias Kneissl'' movie, when the gendarmerie brigade is closing in on the folk hero. The resulting police violence is reminiscent of documentary reports. Vice versa, his documentary films include elements of fiction. The scenes of gold diggers carrying sacks of mud uphill from their claims in the documentary ''Searching for El Dorado'' reminds the viewer of monumental feature movies.

In 2018, Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf catalogued all written documents from the films.\n\n== Cinematic approach ==\n[[Dieter Kosslick]], former director of [[Berlin International Film Festival]] outlined Herbrich's working style as follows:\n\n\"Fortunately Oliver Herbrich doesn\u2019t create an ideology when walking the line between fictional movie and documentary film. Herbrich\u2019s approach is solely based on the storytelling needs of the subjects. Remarkably, this technique results in a combination of documentary and fictional elements. There\u2019s one scene sequence during the ''Mathias Kneissl'' movie, when the gendarmerie brigade is closing in on the folk hero. The resulting police violence is reminiscent of documentary reports. Vice versa, his documentary films include elements of fiction. The scenes of gold diggers carrying sacks of mud uphill from their claims in the documentary ''Searching for El Dorado'' reminds the viewer of monumental feature movies. This evokes a mythologization of the real life, revealing the general in the particular. One can describe Herbrich\u2019s films as stories about human behavior, depicting the mechanisms of reality. Reaching limits and crossing borders is something to be taken in the literal sense in Herbrich\u2019s oeuvre.\u201c (Dieter Kosslick, 1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://582b21a9-78cb-4db6-9393-a87d88b491be.filesusr.com/ugd/1150ef_f943a2006f944fed97cc8d6bb0a017c2.pdf|title=Laudation Film Prize Munich|last=Kosslick|first=Dieter|date=1994|website=(German)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n* 1979/80 ''The Proud and Sad Life of Mathias Kneissl'' (Das stolze und traurige Leben des Mathias Knei\u00dfl)\n* 1982 ''Dead Heart'' (Totes Herz)\n* 1983/84 ''Searching for El Dorado'' (Auf der Suche nach El Dorado)\n* 1983/84 ''Wodzeck''\n* 1985/86 ''The Bavarian Al Capone'' (Der Al Capone vom Donaumoos)\n* 1986/87 The World beyond the World (Die Welt jenseits der Welt)\n* 1987 ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1988/89 ''Earthbound'' (Erdenschwer)\n* 1991 ''Priests of the Condemned'' (Priester der Verdammten)\n* 1992/93 ''Rules of the Road'' (Gesetz der Stra\u00dfe)\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* 1980 and 1984 [[Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung (FBW)|rating]] \u201cHighly Recommended\u201d for ''Mathias Kneissl'' and ''Searching for El Dorado''\n* 1985 Prix d'[[France 2|Antenne II]], Paris (Festival [[Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el|Cinema du Re\u00e9l)]] for ''Searching for El Dorado''; 2nd Price Cine-stud Film Fest, Amsterdam for ''Searching for El Dorado''; Best Male Actor (International Film Festival Moskow) for Detlef K\u00fcgow in ''Wodzeck''\n* 1989 Honorary Mention at 4th Medikinale International Parma, Italy for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''; Honorary Mention at Red Cross and Health Film Fest Varna, Bulgaria for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1990 Best Screenplay (Festival Imag Fic, Madrid) for ''Earthbound''; Best Artistic Contribution (Festival Europa Cinema, Viareggio)  for ''Earthbound''; Prix de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration international del Cine Club (Festival Figuera da Foz, Portugal)  for ''Earthbound''\n* 1994 Film Prize of the City of Munich (lifetime achievement)\n\n== Retrospectives ==\n\n* 1987 Low Budget Festival Hamburg, Germany\n* 1989 Film Week Onikon Cinema Herdecke, Germany\n* 1990 West Virginia Film Festival, Charleston, USA\n* 1993 Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n* 1994 Film Museum Munich, Germany\n* 2018 Breitwand Cinema Gauting, Germany\n\n== Social Engagement ==\n\n* 1990\u20132000 Sponsor \u201cAward for the Outstanding Documentary\u201c ([[Internationales Dokumentarfilmfestival M\u00fcnchen|International Documentary Film Festival Munich]]) \n* 2010 start of charity NGO \u201cFoundation Oliver Herbrich Children's' Fund\u201d\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&query=1062258479 Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[German National Library]]\n*[https://search.onb.ac.at/primo-explore/search?institution=43ACC_ONB&vid=ONB&tab=default_tab&search_scope=ONB_gesamtbestand&mode=basic&displayMode=full&bulkSize=10&highlight=true&dum=true&query=any,contains,Oliver%20Herbrich&displayField=all&lang=de_DE Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[Austrian National Library]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://oliver-herbrich.wixsite.com/archiv/english Oliver Herbrich Filmarchive] (English)\n*[https://www.filmportal.de/en/person/oliver-herbrich_f31295e67ff5a3cfe03053d50b373efb Oliver Herbrich] on filmportal.de (English)\n*[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378688/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Oliver Herbrich] on IMDb.com (English)\n*[https://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?sucheNach=personNr&wert=44 Oliver Herbrich] in Lexikon des int.

The Italian Fascist regime legitimized its claim to Albania through studies proclaiming the racial affinity of Albanians and Italians, especially as opposed to the Slavic Yugoslavs.<ref>{{citation | first=Aristotle A. | last=Kallis | title=Fascist ideology: territory and expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922\u20131945 | publisher=Routledge | year= 2000 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BeeRQHDOKXQC | pages= 132\u2013133}}</ref> Italian Fascists claimed that Albanians were linked through ethnic heritage to [[Italians]] due to links with the prehistoric [[Italiotes]], [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] populations, and that the major influence exhibited by the Roman and Venetian empires over Albania justified Italy's right to possess it.<ref name=\"Ro106\"/>\n\nItaly also attempted to legitimize and win public support for its rule over Albania by supporting Albanian irredentism, directed against the predominantly Albanian-populated [[Kosovo]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], particularly the border area of [[Chameria]], inhabited by the [[Cham Albanians|Cham Albanian]] minority.<ref name=\"Fischer 1999 70\u201373\"/> Thus a Fascist Italian publication named ''Geopolitica'' claimed that the population of the Epirus-[[Acarnania]] region of Greece belonged to Albania due to it being racially [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], and formed a 'single geographic system' with the Adriatic zone.<ref name=Ro106/> Despite the efforts of the Italian vicegerent, [[Francesco Jacomoni]], to stir up insurrections and create a [[fifth column]], and the favourable reports he sent to the Italian foreign minister [[Count Ciano]], events proved that there was little enthusiasm among the Albanians themselves: after the [[Greco-Italian War|Italian invasion of Greece]], most Albanians either deserted or defected.<ref>{{Citation | last=Fischer | first=Bernd J\u00fcrgen | title=Albania at War, 1939\u20131945 | publisher= C.

Mussolini planned to invade Greece and other countries like [[Yugoslavia]] in the area to give Italy territorial control of most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastline, as part of the Fascists' objective of creating the objective of ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (\"Our Sea\") in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean. But the Albanian army under the command of colonel (later general) Prenk Pervizi<ref>Pieter Hidri, General Prenk Pervizi, Tirana, Toena, 2002.</ref> abandoned the Italians in combat, causing a major unraveling of their lines. The Albanian army believed to be the cause of the betrayal was removed from the front. The Colonel Pervizi and his staff of officials was isolated in the mountains of Puka and Shkodra to the North.<ref>''Julian Amery, The sons of the Eagle, London, 1946, s. 302\u2013306''</ref> This was the first action of revolt against the Italian occupation.\n\n[[File:1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Fascist Italy after the invasion of 1939.jpg|thumb|1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Italy after the invasion of 1939]]\n\nBut, soon after the Italian invasion, the Greeks counter-attacked and a sizable portion of Albania was in Greek hands (including the cities of [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] and [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]]). In April 1941, Greece capitulated after an overwhelming [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]]. All of Albania returned to Italian control, which was also extended to most of Greece, which was [[Axis Occupation of Greece|jointly occupied]] by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria. Italian plans however to annex Chameria to Albania were shelved due strong opposition and ethnic conflict between Albanians and Greeks, as well as opposition by [[Aromanians]] to the region being Albanianized.<ref name=Ro108>{{cite book|last=Rodogno. |first=Davide |title=Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fascism%27s+European+empire:+Italian+occupation+during+the+Second+World+War&hl=en&ei=dig_TPn6OYKC8gaGlcDpCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-84515-7|page=108}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, the Italian government began negotiations with Germany, Bulgaria, and the newly established client state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]], on defining their borders. In April Mussolini called for the borders of Albania to be expanded \u2013 including annexing [[Montenegro]] into Albania that would have an autonomous government within Albania, and expanding Albania's border eastwards, though not as far as the Vardar river as some had proposed \u2013 citing that [[Ohrid]]  should be left to the Slavic Macedonians, regardless of whether [[Vardar Macedonia]] would become an independent state or be annexed by Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno Pp. 79\">Davide Rodogno.

Pp. 102\"/> Through a [[tariff]] union, the Italian tariff system was put in place in Albania.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Due to the expected economic losses in Albania from the alteration in tariff policy, the Italian government provided Albania 15 million [[Albanian lek]]s each year in compensation.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Italian customs laws were to apply in Albania and only Italy alone could conclude treaties with third parties.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> Italian capital was allowed to dominate the Albanian economy.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/> As a result, Italian companies were allowed to hold monopolies in the exploitation of Albanian natural resources.<ref name=\"Rapha\u00ebl Lemkin 2005. Pp. 102\"/>\n\nIn 1944, the number of companies and industrial enterprises reached 430, from just 244 in 1938 and only 71 such in 1922. The degree of concentration of workers in industrial production in 1938 doubled compared with 1928. At this time, Albania's economy had trade relations with 21 countries, but most developed were first to Italy and then to Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Greece, etc.\n\nThe country entered capitalist economic development much later than other European countries. Despite the presence of some foreign (mainly Italian) investment, Albania had made little move towards industrial development at the onset of World War II. Agriculture, which employed over 87% of the workforce, was the main sector of the economy and contributed 92.4% of the national income, with main outputs being wheat, maize and rye. Agriculture used primitive tools such as wood ploughs, whilst fertilisers were hardly known at all, and drainage poor. The level of productivity and level of organization and mechanization of agriculture in this period were very low.\n\n==Administrative division==\nThe Italians adopted the existing Albanian system of prefectures ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''prefetture''). In line with the administrative structure of the rest of Italy these were also called provinces (Italian: ''provincia''). However, unlike Italy the Albanian sub-prefecture (Italian: ''sotto prefetture'') was retained. There were initially 10 prefectures.<ref>Great Britain, War Office; Italy OR 5301 (1943)</ref><ref>Great Britain, War Office; Albania OR 5824 (1943)</ref> Under this was 30 sub-prefectures and 23 municipalities (Italian: ''municipalit\u00e0'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029135311/http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |archivedate=29 October 2014 }}</ref> Each Prefecture was run by a Prefect located in the city of the same name.

Mussolini planned to invade Greece and other countries like [[Yugoslavia]] in the area to give Italy territorial control of most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastline, as part of the Fascists' objective of creating the objective of ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (\"Our Sea\") in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean. But the Albanian army under the command of colonel (later general) Prenk Pervizi<ref>Pieter Hidri, General Prenk Pervizi, Tirana, Toena, 2002.</ref> abandoned the Italians in combat, causing a major unraveling of their lines. The Albanian army believed to be the cause of the betrayal was removed from the front. The Colonel Pervizi and his staff of officials was isolated in the mountains of Puka and Shkodra to the North.<ref>''Julian Amery, The sons of the Eagle, London, 1946, s. 302\u2013306''</ref> This was the first action of revolt against the Italian occupation.\n\n[[File:1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Fascist Italy after the invasion of 1939.jpg|thumb|1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Italy after the invasion of 1939]]\n\nBut, soon after the Italian invasion, the Greeks counter-attacked and a sizable portion of Albania was in Greek hands (including the cities of [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] and [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]]). In April 1941, Greece capitulated after an overwhelming [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]]. All of Albania returned to Italian control, which was also extended to most of Greece, which was [[Axis Occupation of Greece|jointly occupied]] by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria.

In April Mussolini called for the borders of Albania to be expanded \u2013 including annexing [[Montenegro]] into Albania that would have an autonomous government within Albania, and expanding Albania's border eastwards, though not as far as the Vardar river as some had proposed \u2013 citing that [[Ohrid]]  should be left to the Slavic Macedonians, regardless of whether [[Vardar Macedonia]] would become an independent state or be annexed by Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno Pp. 79\">Davide Rodogno.

The degree of concentration of workers in industrial production in 1938 doubled compared with 1928. At this time, Albania's economy had trade relations with 21 countries, but most developed were first to Italy and then to Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Greece, etc.\n\nThe country entered capitalist economic development much later than other European countries. Despite the presence of some foreign (mainly Italian) investment, Albania had made little move towards industrial development at the onset of World War II. Agriculture, which employed over 87% of the workforce, was the main sector of the economy and contributed 92.4% of the national income, with main outputs being wheat, maize and rye. Agriculture used primitive tools such as wood ploughs, whilst fertilisers were hardly known at all, and drainage poor. The level of productivity and level of organization and mechanization of agriculture in this period were very low.\n\n==Administrative division==\nThe Italians adopted the existing Albanian system of prefectures ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''prefetture''). In line with the administrative structure of the rest of Italy these were also called provinces (Italian: ''provincia''). However, unlike Italy the Albanian sub-prefecture (Italian: ''sotto prefetture'') was retained. There were initially 10 prefectures.<ref>Great Britain, War Office; Italy OR 5301 (1943)</ref><ref>Great Britain, War Office; Albania OR 5824 (1943)</ref> Under this was 30 sub-prefectures and 23 municipalities (Italian: ''municipalit\u00e0'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029135311/http://www.panorama.com.al/2014/04/22/historia-e-ndarjes-administrative-nga-ismail-qemali-ne-92/ |archivedate=29 October 2014 }}</ref> Each Prefecture was run by a Prefect located in the city of the same name.

The men who were in charge of the finances were also chosen during this time, Captain C.H. Prince and Thomas P. Beard, one black man and one white man. There was also a similar structure for the editors of the paper, one black man and one white man. This was done because in order for their organization to succeed, it was necessary for them to work with white allies who had more access and rights than they did. Bryant was also a huge advocate for education in the black community, especially when it came to equalizing public schools for black children.\n\n== Outcome of Meetings ==\nAfter the April 1866 meeting, the Loyal Georgian went on to run for another year until falling out of print. J.E. Bryant remained the editor of the Loyal Georgian until the end. However, there is no mention of J.E. Bryant after the meetings in 1866 and not information about him except his relation to the Loyal Georgian and the early meetings of the Georgia Equal Rights Association. The other important men like C.H. Prince and Thomas P. Beard also seem to disappear in history after this year's meetings.

President Lincoln is mentioned many times in these meetings as being a savior of the African American people in the United States.  Early prominent leaders of this organization include [[Captain J.E.
