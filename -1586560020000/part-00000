Compared with the Hilux, the Tacoma is engineered with a greater priority on ride quality, handling, comfort, and safety over ruggedness and payload capacity. The design is intended to better suit the needs of the US and Canadian pickup truck market, where pickup trucks, particularly compact and midsized models, are often used as personal vehicles, and less exclusively for commercial, agricultural, and off-road use. The name was derived from the [[Coast Salish peoples]]' name for [[Mt. Rainier]] in Washington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toyota.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7713/~/what-do-the-different-toyota-model-names-mean%3F |title=What do the different Toyota model names mean? |work=Toyota.com |accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment began in 1989, following launch of the fifth-generation Toyota Pickup in late 1988 and concluded in 1994. Design work was done at Calty Design Research in California from 1990 to 1992, when Kevin Hunter's  exterior design proposal was chosen in the autumn of 1991 and in final form, frozen for production in 1992. Patents for the production design were filed in Japan in April 1993 and October 28, 1993, in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=D336266.PN.&OS=PN/D336266&RS=PN/D336266 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109122620/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=D336266.PN.&OS=PN%2FD336266&RS=PN%2FD336266 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-09 |title=United States Patent: D336266 |work=US Patent & Trademark Office Database |date=1993-06-08 |accessdate=2015-11-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080649_2001-2004-toyota-tacoma-pickups-recalled-in-cold-weather-states |title=2001\u20132004 Toyota Tacoma Pickups Recalled In Cold Weather States |first=Suzanne |last=Kane |work=The Car Connection |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThree engines were available for the Toyota Tacoma: \n*2.4&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] rated at {{Convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque\n*2.7&nbsp;L four-cylinder rated at {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|177|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque\n*3.4&nbsp;L [[V6]] rated at {{Convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque\n\nThe 2.4&nbsp;L gave {{convert|26|mpgus||abbr=}} (highway cycle, 2WD), the 2.7&nbsp;L gave {{convert|20|mpgus||abbr=}} (highway cycle, 4WD), and the 3.4&nbsp;L delivered {{convert|21|mpgus||abbr=}} (highway cycle, 2WD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&year1=1997&year2=1997&cbmkToyota=Toyota&cbmcpickupTrucks=Pickup+Trucks&minmsrpsel=0&maxmsrpsel=0&city=0&hwy=0&comb=0&YearSel=1997&make=Toyota&mclass=Pickup+Trucks&vfuel=&vtype=&trany=&drive=&cyl=&MpgSel=000&sortBy=Hwy&Units=&url=SearchServlet&opt=new&minmsrp=0&maxmsrp=0&minmpg=&maxmpg=&rowLimit=25&tabView=0&pageno=1|title=1997 Toyota Truck Fuel Economy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n\nTwo-wheel drive (2WD) Tacomas (non-PreRunner models) had five-stud wheel-lug patterns and available with the 2.4-L or 3.4-L automatic and manual transmissions were available.

The 3.4 V6's manual transmission was an R150F, while the automatic transmission was an A340F ([[Aisin]] code is 30-40LE). The aftermarket TRD [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 3.4-L V6 produced {{convert|254|bhp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|270|lbft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtoyotaparts.com/product/?id=1395|title=Carson Toyota TRD Parts, Replacement parts and accessories for Southern California|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> From 1997 on, the regular cabs were only available with a 2.4-L or a 2.7-L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]]engine. The TRD Off-Road package was introduced in 1998. This package added a locking rear differential and was only available to PreRunner and four-wheel drive models that were equipped with a V6.\n\nIn its first few years of production, the Tacoma sold very well, attracting many young buyers. The first-generation Tacoma underwent a minor headlight upgrade from recessed to flush headlights in October 1996 on 2WD models and a total of two cosmetic facelifts: the first in July 1997 and the second in October 2000. The facelifts mainly entailed grilles (model year MY1998 and 2001) and tailgate badging and emblems (MY1998). Mechanical changes included a switch to distributorless ignitions (coil-on-plug) in 1996 and in 1997 longer rear leaf springs. A passenger-side air bag was added in July 1997, and the driver's-side air bag (standard from 1995 launch) was \"depowered\". Most 4x4 models came with Toyota's Automatic Differential Disconnect system after the 2000 model year.\n\nThe PreRunner model was introduced for the 1998 model year. The PreRunner is a 2WD that shares the same taller suspension and lug pattern as the four-wheel drive. Along with the four-wheel drive model, it was also available with the TRD Off-Road Package that included a locking rear differential, also introduced in 1998.\n\nDesigned through 1998 (by Yusuke Fukushima) as part of the MY2001 facelift (patented on September 22, 1998, at Japan Patent Office under #0890798) was a new crew cab (four-door) model added to the lineup in October 2000. The crew cab, officially dubbed as the Double Cab model, featured four doors and Tokico gas shocks, while the extended cabs still opened with two doors and used Bilstein shocks. The extended cab featured a {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on|1}} bed, while the crew cab featured a {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} bed. Many customers were upset with small crew cab beds, but most competitors shared this shortcoming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www4.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/eng/ishou/iskt_en/ISKT_EN_GM301_Detailed.action |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151128070350/https://www4.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/eng/ishou/iskt_en/ISKT_EN_GM301_Detailed.action |archivedate=2015-11-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2000, along with the front facelift, Toyota had also unveiled an S-Runner trim package that included the 3.4-liter V6 engine. It came with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels, and a five-speed [[manual transmission]] with Tokico gas shocks. Only 800 were produced each month from September 2000 to August 2004. By 2003, the Tacoma had gained 16.5% sales from its previous years. The Tacoma's popularity only increased in the next few years. By 2004, it was ahead of the [[Nissan Frontier]], and [[Dodge Dakota]], but still 2.2% behind in sales to the [[Ford Ranger]].\n\nIn 2008, Toyota proactively announced a 15-year, unlimited-mileage corrosion warranty for 1995\u20132000 model years due to inadequate rustproofing and frame corrosion issues affecting over 800,000 Tacomas. Toyota will either repair the frame or buy back the truck for 1.5 times its [[KBB]] retail value.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1406 |title=Toyota Vehicles : Toyota Announces Customer Support Program For 1995\u20132000 Tacoma Pickups / Toyota |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jensen |first=Christopher |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/toyota-offers-to-buy-back-rusty-tacomas/ |title=Toyota Offers to Buy Back Rusty Tacomas |work=Wheels.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref> This was later extended to include 2001\u20132004 model years, but in these cases when a frame was found to be rusty to the point of perforation, the frame is replaced with a new one instead of a buy back.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nOn November 21, 2012, Toyota recalled about 150,000 Tacoma midsized pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 that were sold primarily in 20 cold-weather U.S. states.

Designers Shigeya Hattori and Hideo Karikomi of Hino, won the internal design competition in 2001. Final designs were frozen for production in 2002 and patents filed on July 3, 2003, with test mules being tested from early 2003.

Launched on October 18, 2004 as a 2005 model, this new Tacoma was available in eighteen different configurations, that included three cab configurations, four transmissions, two engines, and two bed lengths. The three cab configurations consist of regular cab, access cab, and double cab. The transmissions come in 4-speed automatic, 5-speed automatic, 5-speed manual, and 6-speed manual. Beds are: {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on|1}} long bed, and {{convert|5|ft|abbr=on|1}} short bed. The Tacoma's 4.0-liter ''1GR-FE'' V6 took the place of the original 3.4-liter ''5VZ-FE'' V6. The new V6 had many enhancements, such as a tow rating of {{convert|6500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, and a payload capacity of {{convert|1650|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. It produces {{convert|236|hp}} and {{convert|266|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]]. The smaller, but all-new 2.7-liter ''2TR-FE'' 4-cylinder alternative in less expensive models is rated at {{Convert|159|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. of torque.\n\nToyota also introduced an X-Runner trim, which replaces the slow selling S-Runner trim from the previous generation. The X-Runner features the ''1GR-FE'' paired to a six-speed [[manual transmission]], {{convert|18|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} alloy wheels, is lowered two inches from the factory and included an X-Brace suspension package. Toyota also included a Down-Hill Assist Control (DAC) and Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC), with models that were equipped with the optional [[Toyota Racing Development]] (TRD) Off-Road package. DAC automatically applies braking during downhill descents while HAC prevents the vehicle from rolling backwards on hills. A rear [[locking differential]], or [[limited-slip differential]] were also some optional features. Every Tacoma was manufactured with a composite inner bed that includes a deck rail system with four tie down cleats, hook-pins, storage boxes.  TRD package equipped Tacomas also feature an in-bed 115 V/400 W AC power outlet. The tie down cleats are rated to hold up to {{convert|220|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 2006 model Tacoma was a bit different from the 2005 model. The 2006 model made some options standard. Toyota also added 2 new interior colors for the 2007 model year. 2008 models are carry-ons from 2007. For 2009 safety features were added and the Tacoma no longer offers a mechanical limited slip differential rather an open [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] which uses individual wheel braking to simulate a mechanical LSD or \"Auto-LSD\".  TRD off-road models continue to come equipped with a locking rear differential. The second generation Tacomas were assembled in [[Tijuana, Mexico]] and [[Fremont, California]] while the plastic/composite beds were all built in Mexico.  However, in August 2009 Toyota announced that it would relocate Tacoma production from Fremont to [[San Antonio, Texas]].\n\nA minor facelift came for 2009, including a slightly revised grille on some models, new LED taillamps, and on the X-Runner, TRD Offroad and TRD Sport models includes smoked headlamp trim. Auxiliary audio input now comes standard. The Access/Double Cab trucks have two new ceiling mounted speakers and available backup monitor. Four new exterior colors are also added to the Tacoma.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of GM, GM ended its joint venture with Toyota. Toyota, needing additional production volume at its Texas and Mississippi plants, ended Corolla and Tacoma production at the Fremont plant.{{citation needed|reason=Need a reference to say this was the reason for terminating production at NUMMI|date=January 2014}} In 2010 all Tacoma production was moved to Toyota's Texas plant in San Antonio.  The Tacoma will be built alongside the Tundra. This brought a total of approximately 1,000 new jobs to San Antonio\n\nThe 2012 model year refresh featured a restyled front bumper, headlights, grille, hood, new interior and a shark fin antenna for the SiriusXM satellite radio. The 2013 model year comes with touch screen audio system and removes the shark fin antenna and SiriusXM radio capability unless the optional Entune package is installed. 2014 models came with a new SR trim and for 2015 models the regular cab model was discontinued.\n\nIn November 2016, Toyota USA settled a class action suit over frame rust, agreeing to inspect and if necessary replace rusted frames on 2005\u20132010 model year Tacomas, 2007\u20132008 MY [[Toyota Tundra|Tundras]], and 2005\u20132008 MY [[Toyota Sequoia|Sequoias]] in the US and its territories.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://autoweek.com/article/recalls/toyota-frame-settlement-could-cost-company-34-billion |title=Toyota frame rust settlement could cost the company $3.4 billion |first=Richard |last=Truett |work=Autoweek |location=US |date=2016-11-16 |access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref>\n\n[[SG Automotive]] manufactures a truck with a similar grille and headlights called the '''Huanghai Major''' in China.\n\n{{gallery\n|lines=4\n|File:2009 Toyota Tacoma ext cab.jpg|2009 model year Tacoma extended cab (US)\n|File:2012 Toyota Tacoma -- 10-19-2011.jpg|2012 model year Tacoma extended cab 4 cylinder (US)\n|File:06_Toyota_Tacoma_interior.JPG|2006 model year Tacoma Interior\n|File:'13 Toyota Tacoma Crew Cab (MIAS '13).jpg|2013 Toyota Tacoma at the 2013 [[Montreal International Auto Show]]\n}}\n\n===Safety and structural integrity===\nThe Tacoma comes standard with [[anti-lock brakes]], [[brake assist]], and [[electronic brakeforce distribution]]. For 2008, a rollover sensor was added which would deploy the side curtain airbags in the event of rollover in Tacomas equipped with the optional side airbags. Beginning with the 2009 model year, all Tacomas feature Toyota's Star Safety System which added [[Vehicle Stability Control]] and [[traction control system|traction control]]. Front row [[side torso airbag]]s and [[side curtain airbag]]s for both rows also become standard as well as active head restraints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcra.com/2009-cars/16975537/detail.html |title=Most Small Pickups 'Dismal' In Crash Test \u2013 Toyota Rates Best Among 5 Tested |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work=KCRA.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222050107/http://www.kcra.com/2009-cars/16975537/detail.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota/document/2009Tacoma_r.pdf?ncid=12076 |title=Toyota Motor North America Reports December 2017, Year-End Sales |publisher=Toyota |location=US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615174112/http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota/document/2009Tacoma_r.pdf?ncid=12076 |archivedate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nGiven the smaller size of pickup trucks in the Tacoma's category, crash testing for these sized trucks lags with how well most full size trucks perform.

The Sport is targeted more towards improved on-road performance, while the Off-Road is more geared towards the off-road enthusiast. Both are available in 2WD or 4WD, with rear electronic locking differential available only in the Off-Road model. Both variants come with TRD-specific seats, and 400-w AC power inverters mounted in the bed. A TRD supercharger for the 1GR-FE was a dealer-installed option. TRD offered a cold-air intake  and cat-back exhaust system through Toyota dealerships. Also available are TRD cosmetic accessories such as aluminum front skid plate, along with shift knobs (A/T and M/T), radiator cap, oil filler cap, and exhaust tip. TRD also sold seat covers for these Tacomas, but only fit the 2005\u201308 models (09-15 have airbags in the seats, 2005\u201308 do not).\n\nThe TRD Sport package sells in two levels. The first level has a color-matched grille, color-matched front/rear bumpers/door handles/mirrors, and hood with nonfunctional scoop, Bilstein shocks/struts, stainless steel exhaust tip, and aluminum 17-in wheels with 265/65R17 tires. The second level includes the above and adds a towing package (oil and transmission coolers, fan clutch) and heavy-duty high output alternator and battery. The 2005\u201308 model years came with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The 2009\u201315 model years have an open differential with a brake-assisted \"automatic limited slip\" rear differential, similar to a [[Vehicle Stability Control|VSC]] system.\n\nThe TRD Off-Road package includes none of the color-matched body parts (black door handles/mirrors, chrome bumper/grille) or hood scoop from the Sport models, but does have aluminum 16-in wheels, Bilstein shocks, skid plates, and electronic locking rear differential. Features include A-TRAC (2009\u201315), Hill Descent assist (automatic transmission only) and Hill Start assist (manual transmission only). Progressive-rate springs are included, and smaller-diameter sway bars compared to the Sport package, which gives the Off-Road more wheel articulation and a smoother ride, but allows for more body roll. The towing package upgrades the battery, alternator, and fan clutch, and includes oil/transmission coolers (same as the Sport). All-terrain tires (265/70R16) and a heavy duty front tow hook complete the package. \n\n{{anchor|Extreme}}\n{{anchor|Baja}}\n\n====TRD Extreme or T/X Baja====\n\nFrom model years 2012 to 2014, the Tacoma was offered in one of 1500 of the T/X BAJA package. Package includes upgraded lifted suspension with Eibach springs and TRD Bilstein coil-overs in the front and TRD Bilstein reservoir shocks in the rear with an additional leaf spring. The bead-lock style wheels are also added wrapped in BF Goodrich All-terrain tires. The BAJA model also include a stainless steel TRD exhaust.

Although it utilizes the standard 4.0L and 6-speed manual from other Tacomas, the lowered double-wishbone suspension, Bilstein shocks  and frame x-bracing create a remarkable track vehicle rather than a drag-strip brute.\n\nThe X-Runner is only available in three colors per year, and only five colors total. For the 2005 to 2008 model years, the X-Runner was available in Speedway Blue, Radiant Red and Black Sand Pearl. 2009 exchanged Radiant Red for Barcelona Red Metallic and Black Sand Pearl for Black. For the 2012 model year facelift, Speedway Blue became Nautical Blue Metallic and then Blue Ribbon Metallic for 2014/2015. The X-Runner was discontinued in the mainland US after the 2013 model year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/06/toyota-tacoma-x-runner-dead/ |title=Toyota Tacoma X-Runner dead |first=Jeffrey N. |last=Ross |date=2013-08-06 |work=Autoblog |accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref> The X-Runner was last offered in Canada for the 2014 model year{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and in Hawaii (USA) for the 2014/2015 model years.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nKey differences between the X-Runner and the other packages include tweaks to the suspension, hood scoop, ground effects kit, driving lights, sports wheel and tires, and a 3.15 final drive ratio (3.73 for V6 PreRunner and 4X4). Toyota added a rear-mounted X-Brace to stiffen up the rear end (hence the name X-Runner). The chassis was further stiffened by adding two more support braces to the frame.  An optional big brake kit by TRD is also available on the X-Runner; which consists of a 332&nbsp;mm slotted rotor and 4 piston caliper. The BBK (big brake kit) was designed by StopTech. To further its track and sport appeal, TRD also offered a dealer-installed and warrantied roots-style supercharger which raised the power from {{cvt|236|to|300|hp|kW|0}} and the torque was raised from {{cvt|266|to|345|lbf.ft|Nm|0}}.\nA factory TRD composite spoiler was also an option but originals are rare. \nThe X-runner comes only with an [[Aisin RA60]] 6-speed manual transmission produced by [[Aisin Seiki Co.]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nProduction numbers are unknown but it is believed roughly 3,000 X-runners were made each model year. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|N300}} Third generation (N300; 2016\u2013present) ==\n{{Advert section|date=November 2018}}\n<!-- WP uses internationally understood calendar years for section titles instead of model years (understood only by Americans) -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Third generation (N300)\n| image        = 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport Access Cab 3.5L front 5.14.19.jpg\n| caption      = 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport Access Cab (GRN300)\n| production   = August 2015 \u2013 present<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marklines.com/en/global/3241 |title=Marklines |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n| model_years  = 2016\u2013present\n| engine       = 2.7 Liter ''[[Toyota TR engine|2TR-FE]]'' [[I4 engine|I4]] (159 hp) <br /> 3.5 Liter ''[[Toyota GR engine|2GR-FKS]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (278 hp) \n| transmission = 5-speed manual (2016/17)<br />6-speed automatic <br />6-speed manual\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|127.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       =  Access Cab (Short Bed only): {{convert|212.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Double Cab Short Bed: {{convert|212.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Double Cab Long Bed: {{convert|225.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://pressroom.toyota.com/vehicle/2019-toyota-tacoma/ |title=2019 Toyota Tacoma |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date=2019-06-21 |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n| width        = {{convert|74.4-75.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|70.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4425-4480|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]/[[four-wheel drive]]\n| related      = [[Toyota Hilux]]<br />[[Toyota 4Runner]]/[[Toyota Hilux Surf|Hilux Surf]] \n}}\n\nThe new Tacoma was officially unveiled at the January 2015 [[Detroit Auto Show]] with United States sales launch following on September 10, 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.torquenews.com/1083/all-new-2016-toyota-tacoma-goes-sale-today |title=Who will be the first person to drive home the 2016 Toyota Tacoma |first=John |last=Goreham |work=Torque News |date=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wardsauto.com/test-drives/new-tacoma-shines-road-not-slam-dunk-truck |title=New Tacoma Shines Off-Road But Not a Slam-Dunk Truck |first=Christie |last=Schweinsberg |work=WardsAuto |location=US |date=2019-11-20 |access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\nThe truck has a new exterior profile taking styling cues from the 2014 model year [[Toyota 4Runner|4Runner]] SUV and the 2014 model year [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]] pickup and features a much more aggressive and masculine look, with a larger grill and new projector beam headlamps. The tailgate and bed were redesigned and featured a debossed Tacoma logo as well as an infused spoiler. New character lines were also observed on the truck as well as an air dam in front of the vehicle \u2013 these new features will likely assist in added fuel economy.\n\nToyota offers a 2.7 liter [[I4 engine|I4]] engine paired with a 5-speed manual (MY2016-17) or 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.5 liter V6 engine paired with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5 V6 can run on a simulated [[Atkinson cycle]] using [[VVT-i#VVT-iW|VVT-iW]], and feature Toyota's D-4S system which allows it to switch from port injection to [[gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] based on driving conditions. The 2.7 liter delivers {{cvt|120|kW|hp|0}} of power at 5200 rpm and {{cvt|246|Nm|lbft|0}} of torque at 3800 rpm, while the 3.5 liter delivers {{cvt|207|kW|hp|0}} of power at 6000 rpm and {{cvt|359|Nm|lbft|0}} of torque at 4600 rpm. EPA-estimated city/highway/combined mpg for the 4x2 automatic is 19/24/21 and 18/22/20 for the 4x4 automatic. Based on the [[SAE International|SAE]] J2807 tow guidelines the Tacoma can tow up to {{convert|6800|lb|kg|abbr=on|-2}} with the added tow package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/tacoma/ebrochure/|title=2016 Tacoma Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Toyota.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, Toyota updated the truck's frame by adding more high strength steel in order to increase the truck's rigidness and to drop weight. The body is also constructed using ultra-high strength steel that will be integrated using a new hot stamping process that reduces weight. Toyota also updated the suspensions, rear differentials and rear axle to improve the truck's road manners while still keeping it off-road capable. The truck is available in 6 distinct trims, these are the base SR, mid-level SR5, TRD Off Road, TRD Sport, Limited, and range topping TRD Pro. The truck is offered in Access Cab and Double Cab configurations with the long or short bed sizes. The Regular Cab model was not carried over for the new generation pickup. The interior of the pickup gets a complete overhaul as well. Using a handle-bar theme, Toyota made the interior of the Tacoma more luxurious and added a larger touchscreen display as well as an all new instrument panel. Soft-touch materials also replaced the previous generations hard plastics. A leather option was added.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/tacoma/|title=2016 Toyota Tacoma {{!}} Built for the endless weekend|website=www.toyota.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> Toyota has also used an acoustic windshield, better insulated doors, as well as more weather stripping to reduce road and wind noise. For the first time Toyota will offer dual climate control in the newly refined Tacoma.\n\nUnlike the 2nd generation models, the steering wheel controls (as of 2016\u20132017) have reduced functionality, and therefore impaired convenience when attempting to browse phone Contacts / Favorite Contacts. The steering wheel D-pad controls are no longer linked to the Entune system for the purposes of browsing and selecting contacts. Instead, the driver must rely on voice controls, or reaching over to make adjustments to the Entune system to browse and select the appropriate contact in order to place a phone call. Furthermore, D-pad controls no longer offer the ability to scroll through lists of songs during USB or Bluetooth music playback. The driver must use the touch screen to select new albums/artists/songs. These limitations were removed for the 2018 model year onward.\n\nThe TRD Off Road trim models features an all-new terrain select mode which allows the driver to choose between different types of terrain such as, loose rock, mud, and sand. Toyota also announced a new CRAWL mode that will allow the driver to steer the truck in tough terrain while the truck manages braking and acceleration by itself. In addition to this the truck also features a moon-roof, key-less entry, Qi Wireless phone charging capability, easy lower tailgate, blind spot monitoring system, backup camera (standard) and a mounted [[GoPro]] holder (standard).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/2015+naias+2016+toyota+tacoma+dominates.htm |title=Dominate Dirt\u2026or Rocks\u2026or Pavement in the All-New 2016 Toyota Tacoma |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date=2015-01-12 |accessdate=2015-01-15}}</ref>\n\nToyota also introduced a TRD Pro version in late 2016 for the 2017 model year, which comes with FOX-patented Internal Bypass shocks, TRD Pro catback exhaust, TRD Pro skid plate, Rigid Industries LED fog lights, and heritage inspired 'TOYOTA' grille. The 2017 model year TRD Pro was only available in the double cab short bed configuration, with either a manual or automatic gear box in Barcelona Red Metallic, Super White, or Cement. Black leather with red accents and stitching is the only available interior option. For the 2018 model year TRD Pro, Midnight Black Metallic and Cavalry Blue are new available exterior colors, with Barcelona Red Metallic and Cement discontinued.\n\nThe Tacoma's transition to its third generation took place while the segment is growing. In 2014, the San Antonio plant built 105,796 Tacomas and the Baja plant built 71,399 for a total of 177,195.

The 2016 Tacoma 4WD was recreated using the same features and black color paint trim, KC HiLite driving lamps (modified with LED lighting), modified headlights and taillights (matching the 1985 version), the Toyota badging to the truck's tailgate, as well as the same D-4S fuel injection, and the 1985-inspired mudflaps. The only difference between the 1985 original and the 2016 concept is the tires: [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] was featured in the 1985 film, while [[BF Goodrich]] is used on the concept.  The concept also did not have a solid front axle like the original 1985 Pickup.  Toyota notes that this is a one-off concept as there are no plans to offer it as a package or level trim.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/10/21/back-to-the-future-toyota-tacoma-concept/ |title=Great Scott!

Compared with the Hilux, the Tacoma is engineered with a greater priority on ride quality, handling, comfort, and safety over ruggedness and payload capacity. The design is intended to better suit the needs of the US and Canadian pickup truck market, where pickup trucks, particularly compact and midsized models, are often used as personal vehicles, and less exclusively for commercial, agricultural, and off-road use. The name was derived from the [[Coast Salish peoples]]' name for [[Mt. Rainier]] in Washington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toyota.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7713/~/what-do-the-different-toyota-model-names-mean%3F |title=What do the different Toyota model names mean? |work=Toyota.com |accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment began in 1989, following launch of the fifth-generation Toyota Pickup in late 1988 and concluded in 1994. Design work was done at Calty Design Research in California from 1990 to 1992, when Kevin Hunter's  exterior design proposal was chosen in the autumn of 1991 and in final form, frozen for production in 1992. Patents for the production design were filed in Japan in April 1993 and October 28, 1993, in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=D336266.PN.&OS=PN/D336266&RS=PN/D336266 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109122620/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=D336266.PN.&OS=PN%2FD336266&RS=PN%2FD336266 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-09 |title=United States Patent: D336266 |work=US Patent & Trademark Office Database |date=1993-06-08 |accessdate=2015-11-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080649_2001-2004-toyota-tacoma-pickups-recalled-in-cold-weather-states |title=2001\u20132004 Toyota Tacoma Pickups Recalled In Cold Weather States |first=Suzanne |last=Kane |work=The Car Connection |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThree engines were available for the Toyota Tacoma: \n*2.4&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] rated at {{Convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque\n*2.7&nbsp;L four-cylinder rated at {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|177|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque\n*3.4&nbsp;L [[V6]] rated at {{Convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque\n\nThe 2.4&nbsp;L gave {{convert|26|mpgus||abbr=}} (highway cycle, 2WD), the 2.7&nbsp;L gave {{convert|20|mpgus||abbr=}} (highway cycle, 4WD), and the 3.4&nbsp;L delivered {{convert|21|mpgus||abbr=}} (highway cycle, 2WD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&year1=1997&year2=1997&cbmkToyota=Toyota&cbmcpickupTrucks=Pickup+Trucks&minmsrpsel=0&maxmsrpsel=0&city=0&hwy=0&comb=0&YearSel=1997&make=Toyota&mclass=Pickup+Trucks&vfuel=&vtype=&trany=&drive=&cyl=&MpgSel=000&sortBy=Hwy&Units=&url=SearchServlet&opt=new&minmsrp=0&maxmsrp=0&minmpg=&maxmpg=&rowLimit=25&tabView=0&pageno=1|title=1997 Toyota Truck Fuel Economy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n\nTwo-wheel drive (2WD) Tacomas (non-PreRunner models) had five-stud wheel-lug patterns and available with the 2.4-L or 3.4-L automatic and manual transmissions were available.

All PreRunner and all Double Cab models were only available with an automatic transmission for the first generation, while the regular cab and Xtracab four-wheel drive was available with either a manual transmission or automatic transmission.\n\nThe truck's frame is fully boxed until immediately after the rear leaf spring mount bracket, where it transitions into a c-frame section. The 3.4 V6's manual transmission was an R150F, while the automatic transmission was an A340F ([[Aisin]] code is 30-40LE). The aftermarket TRD [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 3.4-L V6 produced {{convert|254|bhp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|270|lbft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtoyotaparts.com/product/?id=1395|title=Carson Toyota TRD Parts, Replacement parts and accessories for Southern California|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> From 1997 on, the regular cabs were only available with a 2.4-L or a 2.7-L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]]engine. The TRD Off-Road package was introduced in 1998. This package added a locking rear differential and was only available to PreRunner and four-wheel drive models that were equipped with a V6.\n\nIn its first few years of production, the Tacoma sold very well, attracting many young buyers. The first-generation Tacoma underwent a minor headlight upgrade from recessed to flush headlights in October 1996 on 2WD models and a total of two cosmetic facelifts: the first in July 1997 and the second in October 2000. The facelifts mainly entailed grilles (model year MY1998 and 2001) and tailgate badging and emblems (MY1998). Mechanical changes included a switch to distributorless ignitions (coil-on-plug) in 1996 and in 1997 longer rear leaf springs. A passenger-side air bag was added in July 1997, and the driver's-side air bag (standard from 1995 launch) was \"depowered\". Most 4x4 models came with Toyota's Automatic Differential Disconnect system after the 2000 model year.\n\nThe PreRunner model was introduced for the 1998 model year. The PreRunner is a 2WD that shares the same taller suspension and lug pattern as the four-wheel drive. Along with the four-wheel drive model, it was also available with the TRD Off-Road Package that included a locking rear differential, also introduced in 1998.\n\nDesigned through 1998 (by Yusuke Fukushima) as part of the MY2001 facelift (patented on September 22, 1998, at Japan Patent Office under #0890798) was a new crew cab (four-door) model added to the lineup in October 2000. The crew cab, officially dubbed as the Double Cab model, featured four doors and Tokico gas shocks, while the extended cabs still opened with two doors and used Bilstein shocks. The extended cab featured a {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on|1}} bed, while the crew cab featured a {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} bed. Many customers were upset with small crew cab beds, but most competitors shared this shortcoming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www4.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/eng/ishou/iskt_en/ISKT_EN_GM301_Detailed.action |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151128070350/https://www4.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/eng/ishou/iskt_en/ISKT_EN_GM301_Detailed.action |archivedate=2015-11-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2000, along with the front facelift, Toyota had also unveiled an S-Runner trim package that included the 3.4-liter V6 engine. It came with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels, and a five-speed [[manual transmission]] with Tokico gas shocks. Only 800 were produced each month from September 2000 to August 2004. By 2003, the Tacoma had gained 16.5% sales from its previous years. The Tacoma's popularity only increased in the next few years.

Designers Shigeya Hattori and Hideo Karikomi of Hino, won the internal design competition in 2001. Final designs were frozen for production in 2002 and patents filed on July 3, 2003, with test mules being tested from early 2003. Prototypes were built later in 2003, with development ending in the second quarter of 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/tacoma |title=Toyota Tacoma |author=<!-- staff editors --> |website=Car and Driver |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 2004 at the [[Chicago Auto Show]], Toyota unveiled a bigger and more powerful Tacoma. Launched on October 18, 2004 as a 2005 model, this new Tacoma was available in eighteen different configurations, that included three cab configurations, four transmissions, two engines, and two bed lengths. The three cab configurations consist of regular cab, access cab, and double cab. The transmissions come in 4-speed automatic, 5-speed automatic, 5-speed manual, and 6-speed manual. Beds are: {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on|1}} long bed, and {{convert|5|ft|abbr=on|1}} short bed. The Tacoma's 4.0-liter ''1GR-FE'' V6 took the place of the original 3.4-liter ''5VZ-FE'' V6. The new V6 had many enhancements, such as a tow rating of {{convert|6500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, and a payload capacity of {{convert|1650|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. It produces {{convert|236|hp}} and {{convert|266|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]]. The smaller, but all-new 2.7-liter ''2TR-FE'' 4-cylinder alternative in less expensive models is rated at {{Convert|159|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. of torque.\n\nToyota also introduced an X-Runner trim, which replaces the slow selling S-Runner trim from the previous generation. The X-Runner features the ''1GR-FE'' paired to a six-speed [[manual transmission]], {{convert|18|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} alloy wheels, is lowered two inches from the factory and included an X-Brace suspension package. Toyota also included a Down-Hill Assist Control (DAC) and Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC), with models that were equipped with the optional [[Toyota Racing Development]] (TRD) Off-Road package. DAC automatically applies braking during downhill descents while HAC prevents the vehicle from rolling backwards on hills. A rear [[locking differential]], or [[limited-slip differential]] were also some optional features. Every Tacoma was manufactured with a composite inner bed that includes a deck rail system with four tie down cleats, hook-pins, storage boxes.  TRD package equipped Tacomas also feature an in-bed 115 V/400 W AC power outlet. The tie down cleats are rated to hold up to {{convert|220|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 2006 model Tacoma was a bit different from the 2005 model. The 2006 model made some options standard. Toyota also added 2 new interior colors for the 2007 model year. 2008 models are carry-ons from 2007. For 2009 safety features were added and the Tacoma no longer offers a mechanical limited slip differential rather an open [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] which uses individual wheel braking to simulate a mechanical LSD or \"Auto-LSD\".  TRD off-road models continue to come equipped with a locking rear differential. The second generation Tacomas were assembled in [[Tijuana, Mexico]] and [[Fremont, California]] while the plastic/composite beds were all built in Mexico.  However, in August 2009 Toyota announced that it would relocate Tacoma production from Fremont to [[San Antonio, Texas]].\n\nA minor facelift came for 2009, including a slightly revised grille on some models, new LED taillamps, and on the X-Runner, TRD Offroad and TRD Sport models includes smoked headlamp trim. Auxiliary audio input now comes standard. The Access/Double Cab trucks have two new ceiling mounted speakers and available backup monitor. Four new exterior colors are also added to the Tacoma.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of GM, GM ended its joint venture with Toyota. Toyota, needing additional production volume at its Texas and Mississippi plants, ended Corolla and Tacoma production at the Fremont plant.{{citation needed|reason=Need a reference to say this was the reason for terminating production at NUMMI|date=January 2014}} In 2010 all Tacoma production was moved to Toyota's Texas plant in San Antonio.  The Tacoma will be built alongside the Tundra. This brought a total of approximately 1,000 new jobs to San Antonio\n\nThe 2012 model year refresh featured a restyled front bumper, headlights, grille, hood, new interior and a shark fin antenna for the SiriusXM satellite radio. The 2013 model year comes with touch screen audio system and removes the shark fin antenna and SiriusXM radio capability unless the optional Entune package is installed. 2014 models came with a new SR trim and for 2015 models the regular cab model was discontinued.\n\nIn November 2016, Toyota USA settled a class action suit over frame rust, agreeing to inspect and if necessary replace rusted frames on 2005\u20132010 model year Tacomas, 2007\u20132008 MY [[Toyota Tundra|Tundras]], and 2005\u20132008 MY [[Toyota Sequoia|Sequoias]] in the US and its territories.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://autoweek.com/article/recalls/toyota-frame-settlement-could-cost-company-34-billion |title=Toyota frame rust settlement could cost the company $3.4 billion |first=Richard |last=Truett |work=Autoweek |location=US |date=2016-11-16 |access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref>\n\n[[SG Automotive]] manufactures a truck with a similar grille and headlights called the '''Huanghai Major''' in China.\n\n{{gallery\n|lines=4\n|File:2009 Toyota Tacoma ext cab.jpg|2009 model year Tacoma extended cab (US)\n|File:2012 Toyota Tacoma -- 10-19-2011.jpg|2012 model year Tacoma extended cab 4 cylinder (US)\n|File:06_Toyota_Tacoma_interior.JPG|2006 model year Tacoma Interior\n|File:'13 Toyota Tacoma Crew Cab (MIAS '13).jpg|2013 Toyota Tacoma at the 2013 [[Montreal International Auto Show]]\n}}\n\n===Safety and structural integrity===\nThe Tacoma comes standard with [[anti-lock brakes]], [[brake assist]], and [[electronic brakeforce distribution]]. For 2008, a rollover sensor was added which would deploy the side curtain airbags in the event of rollover in Tacomas equipped with the optional side airbags. Beginning with the 2009 model year, all Tacomas feature Toyota's Star Safety System which added [[Vehicle Stability Control]] and [[traction control system|traction control]]. Front row [[side torso airbag]]s and [[side curtain airbag]]s for both rows also become standard as well as active head restraints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcra.com/2009-cars/16975537/detail.html |title=Most Small Pickups 'Dismal' In Crash Test \u2013 Toyota Rates Best Among 5 Tested |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work=KCRA.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222050107/http://www.kcra.com/2009-cars/16975537/detail.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota/document/2009Tacoma_r.pdf?ncid=12076 |title=Toyota Motor North America Reports December 2017, Year-End Sales |publisher=Toyota |location=US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615174112/http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota/document/2009Tacoma_r.pdf?ncid=12076 |archivedate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nGiven the smaller size of pickup trucks in the Tacoma's category, crash testing for these sized trucks lags with how well most full size trucks perform.

The Sport is targeted more towards improved on-road performance, while the Off-Road is more geared towards the off-road enthusiast. Both are available in 2WD or 4WD, with rear electronic locking differential available only in the Off-Road model. Both variants come with TRD-specific seats, and 400-w AC power inverters mounted in the bed. A TRD supercharger for the 1GR-FE was a dealer-installed option. TRD offered a cold-air intake  and cat-back exhaust system through Toyota dealerships. Also available are TRD cosmetic accessories such as aluminum front skid plate, along with shift knobs (A/T and M/T), radiator cap, oil filler cap, and exhaust tip. TRD also sold seat covers for these Tacomas, but only fit the 2005\u201308 models (09-15 have airbags in the seats, 2005\u201308 do not).\n\nThe TRD Sport package sells in two levels. The first level has a color-matched grille, color-matched front/rear bumpers/door handles/mirrors, and hood with nonfunctional scoop, Bilstein shocks/struts, stainless steel exhaust tip, and aluminum 17-in wheels with 265/65R17 tires. The second level includes the above and adds a towing package (oil and transmission coolers, fan clutch) and heavy-duty high output alternator and battery. The 2005\u201308 model years came with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The 2009\u201315 model years have an open differential with a brake-assisted \"automatic limited slip\" rear differential, similar to a [[Vehicle Stability Control|VSC]] system.\n\nThe TRD Off-Road package includes none of the color-matched body parts (black door handles/mirrors, chrome bumper/grille) or hood scoop from the Sport models, but does have aluminum 16-in wheels, Bilstein shocks, skid plates, and electronic locking rear differential. Features include A-TRAC (2009\u201315), Hill Descent assist (automatic transmission only) and Hill Start assist (manual transmission only). Progressive-rate springs are included, and smaller-diameter sway bars compared to the Sport package, which gives the Off-Road more wheel articulation and a smoother ride, but allows for more body roll. The towing package upgrades the battery, alternator, and fan clutch, and includes oil/transmission coolers (same as the Sport). All-terrain tires (265/70R16) and a heavy duty front tow hook complete the package. \n\n{{anchor|Extreme}}\n{{anchor|Baja}}\n\n====TRD Extreme or T/X Baja====\n\nFrom model years 2012 to 2014, the Tacoma was offered in one of 1500 of the T/X BAJA package. Package includes upgraded lifted suspension with Eibach springs and TRD Bilstein coil-overs in the front and TRD Bilstein reservoir shocks in the rear with an additional leaf spring. The bead-lock style wheels are also added wrapped in BF Goodrich All-terrain tires. The BAJA model also include a stainless steel TRD exhaust.

Although it utilizes the standard 4.0L and 6-speed manual from other Tacomas, the lowered double-wishbone suspension, Bilstein shocks  and frame x-bracing create a remarkable track vehicle rather than a drag-strip brute.\n\nThe X-Runner is only available in three colors per year, and only five colors total. For the 2005 to 2008 model years, the X-Runner was available in Speedway Blue, Radiant Red and Black Sand Pearl. 2009 exchanged Radiant Red for Barcelona Red Metallic and Black Sand Pearl for Black. For the 2012 model year facelift, Speedway Blue became Nautical Blue Metallic and then Blue Ribbon Metallic for 2014/2015. The X-Runner was discontinued in the mainland US after the 2013 model year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/06/toyota-tacoma-x-runner-dead/ |title=Toyota Tacoma X-Runner dead |first=Jeffrey N. |last=Ross |date=2013-08-06 |work=Autoblog |accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref> The X-Runner was last offered in Canada for the 2014 model year{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and in Hawaii (USA) for the 2014/2015 model years.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nKey differences between the X-Runner and the other packages include tweaks to the suspension, hood scoop, ground effects kit, driving lights, sports wheel and tires, and a 3.15 final drive ratio (3.73 for V6 PreRunner and 4X4). Toyota added a rear-mounted X-Brace to stiffen up the rear end (hence the name X-Runner). The chassis was further stiffened by adding two more support braces to the frame.  An optional big brake kit by TRD is also available on the X-Runner; which consists of a 332&nbsp;mm slotted rotor and 4 piston caliper. The BBK (big brake kit) was designed by StopTech. To further its track and sport appeal, TRD also offered a dealer-installed and warrantied roots-style supercharger which raised the power from {{cvt|236|to|300|hp|kW|0}} and the torque was raised from {{cvt|266|to|345|lbf.ft|Nm|0}}.\nA factory TRD composite spoiler was also an option but originals are rare. \nThe X-runner comes only with an [[Aisin RA60]] 6-speed manual transmission produced by [[Aisin Seiki Co.]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nProduction numbers are unknown but it is believed roughly 3,000 X-runners were made each model year. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|N300}} Third generation (N300; 2016\u2013present) ==\n{{Advert section|date=November 2018}}\n<!-- WP uses internationally understood calendar years for section titles instead of model years (understood only by Americans) -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Third generation (N300)\n| image        = 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport Access Cab 3.5L front 5.14.19.jpg\n| caption      = 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport Access Cab (GRN300)\n| production   = August 2015 \u2013 present<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marklines.com/en/global/3241 |title=Marklines |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n| model_years  = 2016\u2013present\n| engine       = 2.7 Liter ''[[Toyota TR engine|2TR-FE]]'' [[I4 engine|I4]] (159 hp) <br /> 3.5 Liter ''[[Toyota GR engine|2GR-FKS]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (278 hp) \n| transmission = 5-speed manual (2016/17)<br />6-speed automatic <br />6-speed manual\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|127.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       =  Access Cab (Short Bed only): {{convert|212.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Double Cab Short Bed: {{convert|212.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Double Cab Long Bed: {{convert|225.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://pressroom.toyota.com/vehicle/2019-toyota-tacoma/ |title=2019 Toyota Tacoma |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date=2019-06-21 |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n| width        = {{convert|74.4-75.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|70.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4425-4480|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]/[[four-wheel drive]]\n| related      = [[Toyota Hilux]]<br />[[Toyota 4Runner]]/[[Toyota Hilux Surf|Hilux Surf]] \n}}\n\nThe new Tacoma was officially unveiled at the January 2015 [[Detroit Auto Show]] with United States sales launch following on September 10, 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.torquenews.com/1083/all-new-2016-toyota-tacoma-goes-sale-today |title=Who will be the first person to drive home the 2016 Toyota Tacoma |first=John |last=Goreham |work=Torque News |date=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wardsauto.com/test-drives/new-tacoma-shines-road-not-slam-dunk-truck |title=New Tacoma Shines Off-Road But Not a Slam-Dunk Truck |first=Christie |last=Schweinsberg |work=WardsAuto |location=US |date=2019-11-20 |access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\nThe truck has a new exterior profile taking styling cues from the 2014 model year [[Toyota 4Runner|4Runner]] SUV and the 2014 model year [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]] pickup and features a much more aggressive and masculine look, with a larger grill and new projector beam headlamps. The tailgate and bed were redesigned and featured a debossed Tacoma logo as well as an infused spoiler. New character lines were also observed on the truck as well as an air dam in front of the vehicle \u2013 these new features will likely assist in added fuel economy.\n\nToyota offers a 2.7 liter [[I4 engine|I4]] engine paired with a 5-speed manual (MY2016-17) or 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.5 liter V6 engine paired with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5 V6 can run on a simulated [[Atkinson cycle]] using [[VVT-i#VVT-iW|VVT-iW]], and feature Toyota's D-4S system which allows it to switch from port injection to [[gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] based on driving conditions. The 2.7 liter delivers {{cvt|120|kW|hp|0}} of power at 5200 rpm and {{cvt|246|Nm|lbft|0}} of torque at 3800 rpm, while the 3.5 liter delivers {{cvt|207|kW|hp|0}} of power at 6000 rpm and {{cvt|359|Nm|lbft|0}} of torque at 4600 rpm. EPA-estimated city/highway/combined mpg for the 4x2 automatic is 19/24/21 and 18/22/20 for the 4x4 automatic. Based on the [[SAE International|SAE]] J2807 tow guidelines the Tacoma can tow up to {{convert|6800|lb|kg|abbr=on|-2}} with the added tow package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/tacoma/ebrochure/|title=2016 Tacoma Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Toyota.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, Toyota updated the truck's frame by adding more high strength steel in order to increase the truck's rigidness and to drop weight. The body is also constructed using ultra-high strength steel that will be integrated using a new hot stamping process that reduces weight. Toyota also updated the suspensions, rear differentials and rear axle to improve the truck's road manners while still keeping it off-road capable. The truck is available in 6 distinct trims, these are the base SR, mid-level SR5, TRD Off Road, TRD Sport, Limited, and range topping TRD Pro. The truck is offered in Access Cab and Double Cab configurations with the long or short bed sizes. The Regular Cab model was not carried over for the new generation pickup. The interior of the pickup gets a complete overhaul as well. Using a handle-bar theme, Toyota made the interior of the Tacoma more luxurious and added a larger touchscreen display as well as an all new instrument panel. Soft-touch materials also replaced the previous generations hard plastics. A leather option was added.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/tacoma/|title=2016 Toyota Tacoma {{!}} Built for the endless weekend|website=www.toyota.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> Toyota has also used an acoustic windshield, better insulated doors, as well as more weather stripping to reduce road and wind noise. For the first time Toyota will offer dual climate control in the newly refined Tacoma.\n\nUnlike the 2nd generation models, the steering wheel controls (as of 2016\u20132017) have reduced functionality, and therefore impaired convenience when attempting to browse phone Contacts / Favorite Contacts. The steering wheel D-pad controls are no longer linked to the Entune system for the purposes of browsing and selecting contacts. Instead, the driver must rely on voice controls, or reaching over to make adjustments to the Entune system to browse and select the appropriate contact in order to place a phone call. Furthermore, D-pad controls no longer offer the ability to scroll through lists of songs during USB or Bluetooth music playback. The driver must use the touch screen to select new albums/artists/songs. These limitations were removed for the 2018 model year onward.\n\nThe TRD Off Road trim models features an all-new terrain select mode which allows the driver to choose between different types of terrain such as, loose rock, mud, and sand. Toyota also announced a new CRAWL mode that will allow the driver to steer the truck in tough terrain while the truck manages braking and acceleration by itself. In addition to this the truck also features a moon-roof, key-less entry, Qi Wireless phone charging capability, easy lower tailgate, blind spot monitoring system, backup camera (standard) and a mounted [[GoPro]] holder (standard).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/2015+naias+2016+toyota+tacoma+dominates.htm |title=Dominate Dirt\u2026or Rocks\u2026or Pavement in the All-New 2016 Toyota Tacoma |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date=2015-01-12 |accessdate=2015-01-15}}</ref>\n\nToyota also introduced a TRD Pro version in late 2016 for the 2017 model year, which comes with FOX-patented Internal Bypass shocks, TRD Pro catback exhaust, TRD Pro skid plate, Rigid Industries LED fog lights, and heritage inspired 'TOYOTA' grille. The 2017 model year TRD Pro was only available in the double cab short bed configuration, with either a manual or automatic gear box in Barcelona Red Metallic, Super White, or Cement. Black leather with red accents and stitching is the only available interior option. For the 2018 model year TRD Pro, Midnight Black Metallic and Cavalry Blue are new available exterior colors, with Barcelona Red Metallic and Cement discontinued.\n\nThe Tacoma's transition to its third generation took place while the segment is growing. In 2014, the San Antonio plant built 105,796 Tacomas and the Baja plant built 71,399 for a total of 177,195.

The 2016 Tacoma 4WD was recreated using the same features and black color paint trim, KC HiLite driving lamps (modified with LED lighting), modified headlights and taillights (matching the 1985 version), the Toyota badging to the truck's tailgate, as well as the same D-4S fuel injection, and the 1985-inspired mudflaps. The only difference between the 1985 original and the 2016 concept is the tires: [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] was featured in the 1985 film, while [[BF Goodrich]] is used on the concept.  The concept also did not have a solid front axle like the original 1985 Pickup.  Toyota notes that this is a one-off concept as there are no plans to offer it as a package or level trim.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/10/21/back-to-the-future-toyota-tacoma-concept/ |title=Great Scott!
