[[Build automation]] is a best practice itself.<ref name=\"Brauneis, [OSLC] Possible new Working Group - Automation\">{{Cite mailing list |url=http://open-services.net/pipermail/community_open-services.net/2010-January/000214.html |title=[OSLC] Possible new Working Group \u2013 Automation |date=1 January 2010 |last=Brauneis |first=David |mailinglist=open-services.net Community |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Taylor, Rails Deployment and Automation with ShadowPuppet and Capistrano\">{{Cite web |url=http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2009/02/10/rails-deployment-and-automation-with-shadowpuppet-and-capistrano/ |title=Rails Deployment and Automation with ShadowPuppet and Capistrano |last=Taylor |first=Bradley |website=Rails machine |type=[[World wide web]] log |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121202054105/http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2009/02/10/rails-deployment-and-automation-with-shadowpuppet-and-capistrano/ |archive-date=2 December 2012 |access-date=16 February 2010 |ref=Taylor, Rails Deployment and Automation with ShadowPuppet and Capistrano}}</ref>\n\nContinuous integration \u2013 the practice of frequently integrating one's new or changed code with the existing code repository \u2013 should occur frequently enough that no intervening window remains between [[Commit (data management)|commit]] and [[Software build|build]], and such that no errors can arise without developers noticing them and correcting them immediately.<ref name=\"martinfowler\" /> Normal practice is to trigger these builds by every commit to a repository, rather than a periodically scheduled build. The practicalities of doing this in a multi-developer environment of rapid commits are such that it is usual to trigger a short time after each commit, then to start a build when either this timer expires, or after a rather longer interval since the last build. Note that since each new commit resets the timer used for the short time trigger, this is the same technique used in many button debouncing algorithms [ex:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce |title=Debounce |date=29 July 2015 |website=Arduino}}</ref>]. In this way the commit events are \"debounced\" to prevent unnecessary builds between a series of rapid-fire commits. Many automated tools offer this scheduling automatically.\n\nAnother factor is the need for a version control system that supports [[atomic commit]]s, i.e. all of a developer's changes may be seen as a single commit operation. There is no point in trying to build from only half of the changed files.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, continuous integration relies on the following principles.\n\n=== Maintain a code repository ===\n{{Main|Version control}}\n\nThis practice advocates the use of a revision control system for the project's source code. All artifacts required to build the project should be placed in the repository. In this practice and in the revision control community, the convention is that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies. [[Extreme Programming]] advocate [[Martin Fowler (software engineer)|Martin Fowler]] also mentions that where [[branching (software)|branching]] is supported by tools, its use should be minimised.<ref name=\"Fowler, Continuous Integration practices\">{{Cite web |url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#PracticesOfContinuousIntegration |title=Practices |last=Fowler |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Fowler (software engineer) |website=Continuous Integration |type=article |access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> Instead, it is preferred for changes to be integrated rather than for multiple versions of the software to be maintained simultaneously. The mainline (or [[trunk (software)|trunk]]) should be the place for the working version of the software.\n\n=== Automate the build ===\n{{Main|Build automation}}\n\nA single command should have the capability of building the system. Many build tools, such as [[make (software)|make]], have existed for many years. [[List of build automation software|Other more recent tools]] are frequently used in continuous integration environments. Automation of the build should include automating the integration, which often includes [[software deployment|deployment]] into a production-like [[Deployment environment|environment]]. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries, but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian [[Deb (file format)|DEB]], Red Hat [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] or Windows [[Microsoft Installer|MSI]] files).\n\n=== Make the build self-testing ===\n\nOnce the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it behaves as the developers expect it to behave.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/continuous-integration |title=Continuous integration |last=Radigan |first=Dan |website=Atlassian Agile Coach}}</ref>\n\n=== Everyone commits to the baseline every day ===\n\nBy committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes. Checking in a week's worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve. Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration |title=Continuous Integration |website=Thoughtworks}}</ref> Committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built) is generally considered part of the definition of Continuous Integration. In addition performing a [[nightly build]] is generally recommended.{{Citation needed|date =April 2012}} These are lower bounds; the typical frequency is expected to be much higher.\n\n=== Every commit (to baseline) should be built ===\n\nThe system should build commits to the current working version to verify that they integrate correctly. A common practice is to use Automated Continuous Integration, although this may be done manually. Automated Continuous Integration employs a continuous integration server or [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]] to monitor the [[revision control|revision control system]] for changes, then automatically run the build process.\n\n=== Every bug-fix commit should come with a test case ===\n\nWhen fixing a bug, it is a good practice to push a test case that reproduces the bug. This avoids the fix to be reverted, and the bug to reappear, which is known as a [[Regression testing|regression]]. Researchers have proposed to automate this task: if a bug-fix commit does not contain a test case, it can be generated from the already existing tests.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Danglot |first=Benjamin |last2=Monperrus |first2=Martin |last3=Rudametkin |first3=Walter |last4=Baudry |first4=Benoit |date=2020-03-05 |title=An approach and benchmark to detect behavioral changes of commits in continuous integration |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08482 |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |language=en |doi=10.1007/s10664-019-09794-7 |issn=1382-3256|arxiv=1902.08482 }}</ref>\n\n=== Keep the build fast ===\n\nThe build needs to complete rapidly, so that if there is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified.\n\n=== Test in a clone of the production environment ===\n{{main|Test environment}}\nHaving a [[test environment]] can lead to failures in tested systems when they deploy in the [[production environment]] because the production environment may differ from the test environment in a significant way. However, building a replica of a production environment is cost prohibitive. Instead, the test environment, or a separate [[pre-production environment]] (\"staging\") should be built to be a scalable version of the production environment to alleviate costs while maintaining [[technology stack]] composition and nuances. Within these test environments, [[service virtualisation]] is commonly used to obtain on-demand access to dependencies (e.g., APIs, third-party applications, services, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], etc.) that are beyond the team's control, still evolving, or too complex to configure in a virtual test lab.\n\n=== Make it easy to get the latest deliverables ===\n\nMaking builds readily available to stakeholders and testers can reduce the amount of rework necessary when rebuilding a feature that doesn't meet requirements. Additionally, early testing reduces the chances that defects survive until deployment. Finding errors earlier can reduce the amount of work necessary to resolve them.\n\nAll programmers should start the day by updating the project from the repository. That way, they will all stay up to date.\n\n=== Everyone can see the results of the latest build ===\n\nIt should be easy to find out whether the build breaks and, if so, who made the relevant change and what that change was.\n\n=== Automate deployment ===\n\nMost CI systems allow the running of scripts after a build finishes. In most situations, it is possible to write a script to deploy the application to a live test server that everyone can look at. A further advance in this way of thinking is [[continuous deployment]], which calls for the software to be deployed directly into production, often with additional automation to prevent defects or regressions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/continuous-deployment-5-eas.html |title=Continuous deployment in 5 easy steps |last=Ries |first=Eric |date=30 March 2009 |website=Radar |publisher=O\u2019Reilly |access-date=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/ |title=Continuous Deployment at IMVU: Doing the impossible fifty times a day |last=Fitz |first=Timothy |date=10 February 2009 |publisher=Wordpress |access-date=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Costs and benefits ==\n{{POV section|date=May 2016}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\n\nContinuous integration is intended to produce benefits such as:\n\n* [[Software testing#Integration testing|Integration bugs]] are detected early and are easy to track down due to small change sets.

The practicalities of doing this in a multi-developer environment of rapid commits are such that it is usual to trigger a short time after each commit, then to start a build when either this timer expires, or after a rather longer interval since the last build. Note that since each new commit resets the timer used for the short time trigger, this is the same technique used in many button debouncing algorithms [ex:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce |title=Debounce |date=29 July 2015 |website=Arduino}}</ref>]. In this way the commit events are \"debounced\" to prevent unnecessary builds between a series of rapid-fire commits. Many automated tools offer this scheduling automatically.\n\nAnother factor is the need for a version control system that supports [[atomic commit]]s, i.e. all of a developer's changes may be seen as a single commit operation. There is no point in trying to build from only half of the changed files.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, continuous integration relies on the following principles.\n\n=== Maintain a code repository ===\n{{Main|Version control}}\n\nThis practice advocates the use of a revision control system for the project's source code. All artifacts required to build the project should be placed in the repository. In this practice and in the revision control community, the convention is that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies. [[Extreme Programming]] advocate [[Martin Fowler (software engineer)|Martin Fowler]] also mentions that where [[branching (software)|branching]] is supported by tools, its use should be minimised.<ref name=\"Fowler, Continuous Integration practices\">{{Cite web |url=http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#PracticesOfContinuousIntegration |title=Practices |last=Fowler |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Fowler (software engineer) |website=Continuous Integration |type=article |access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> Instead, it is preferred for changes to be integrated rather than for multiple versions of the software to be maintained simultaneously. The mainline (or [[trunk (software)|trunk]]) should be the place for the working version of the software.\n\n=== Automate the build ===\n{{Main|Build automation}}\n\nA single command should have the capability of building the system. Many build tools, such as [[make (software)|make]], have existed for many years. [[List of build automation software|Other more recent tools]] are frequently used in continuous integration environments. Automation of the build should include automating the integration, which often includes [[software deployment|deployment]] into a production-like [[Deployment environment|environment]]. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries, but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian [[Deb (file format)|DEB]], Red Hat [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] or Windows [[Microsoft Installer|MSI]] files).\n\n=== Make the build self-testing ===\n\nOnce the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it behaves as the developers expect it to behave.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/continuous-integration |title=Continuous integration |last=Radigan |first=Dan |website=Atlassian Agile Coach}}</ref>\n\n=== Everyone commits to the baseline every day ===\n\nBy committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes. Checking in a week's worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve. Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration |title=Continuous Integration |website=Thoughtworks}}</ref> Committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built) is generally considered part of the definition of Continuous Integration. In addition performing a [[nightly build]] is generally recommended.{{Citation needed|date =April 2012}} These are lower bounds; the typical frequency is expected to be much higher.\n\n=== Every commit (to baseline) should be built ===\n\nThe system should build commits to the current working version to verify that they integrate correctly. A common practice is to use Automated Continuous Integration, although this may be done manually. Automated Continuous Integration employs a continuous integration server or [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]] to monitor the [[revision control|revision control system]] for changes, then automatically run the build process.\n\n=== Every bug-fix commit should come with a test case ===\n\nWhen fixing a bug, it is a good practice to push a test case that reproduces the bug. This avoids the fix to be reverted, and the bug to reappear, which is known as a [[Regression testing|regression]]. Researchers have proposed to automate this task: if a bug-fix commit does not contain a test case, it can be generated from the already existing tests.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Danglot |first=Benjamin |last2=Monperrus |first2=Martin |last3=Rudametkin |first3=Walter |last4=Baudry |first4=Benoit |date=2020-03-05 |title=An approach and benchmark to detect behavioral changes of commits in continuous integration |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08482 |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |language=en |doi=10.1007/s10664-019-09794-7 |issn=1382-3256|arxiv=1902.08482 }}</ref>\n\n=== Keep the build fast ===\n\nThe build needs to complete rapidly, so that if there is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified.\n\n=== Test in a clone of the production environment ===\n{{main|Test environment}}\nHaving a [[test environment]] can lead to failures in tested systems when they deploy in the [[production environment]] because the production environment may differ from the test environment in a significant way. However, building a replica of a production environment is cost prohibitive. Instead, the test environment, or a separate [[pre-production environment]] (\"staging\") should be built to be a scalable version of the production environment to alleviate costs while maintaining [[technology stack]] composition and nuances. Within these test environments, [[service virtualisation]] is commonly used to obtain on-demand access to dependencies (e.g., APIs, third-party applications, services, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], etc.) that are beyond the team's control, still evolving, or too complex to configure in a virtual test lab.\n\n=== Make it easy to get the latest deliverables ===\n\nMaking builds readily available to stakeholders and testers can reduce the amount of rework necessary when rebuilding a feature that doesn't meet requirements. Additionally, early testing reduces the chances that defects survive until deployment. Finding errors earlier can reduce the amount of work necessary to resolve them.\n\nAll programmers should start the day by updating the project from the repository. That way, they will all stay up to date.\n\n=== Everyone can see the results of the latest build ===\n\nIt should be easy to find out whether the build breaks and, if so, who made the relevant change and what that change was.\n\n=== Automate deployment ===\n\nMost CI systems allow the running of scripts after a build finishes. In most situations, it is possible to write a script to deploy the application to a live test server that everyone can look at. A further advance in this way of thinking is [[continuous deployment]], which calls for the software to be deployed directly into production, often with additional automation to prevent defects or regressions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/continuous-deployment-5-eas.html |title=Continuous deployment in 5 easy steps |last=Ries |first=Eric |date=30 March 2009 |website=Radar |publisher=O\u2019Reilly |access-date=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/ |title=Continuous Deployment at IMVU: Doing the impossible fifty times a day |last=Fitz |first=Timothy |date=10 February 2009 |publisher=Wordpress |access-date=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Costs and benefits ==\n{{POV section|date=May 2016}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\n\nContinuous integration is intended to produce benefits such as:\n\n* [[Software testing#Integration testing|Integration bugs]] are detected early and are easy to track down due to small change sets.

He has also been [[Fidesz|President of Fidesz]], a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] political party, since 1993, with a brief break between 2000 and 2003.\n\nBorn in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Orb\u00e1n studied law at [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]], graduating in 1987. He briefly studied [[political science]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], before returning to Hungary to enter politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989|Autumn of Nations]]. He became head of the reformist student movement the Alliance of Young Democrats (''Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge''), which would eventually become the Fidesz party. Orb\u00e1n became a nationally known politician after giving an address at the 1989 reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and other [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|martyrs of the 1956 revolution]], in which he openly demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from the country.\n\nAfter the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|transition to democracy]] in 1990, he was elected to the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] and served as the leader of Fidesz's parliamentary caucus until 1993. Under his leadership, Fidesz shifted away from its original [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[European integration|pro-European integration]] platform toward more [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] national conservatism. After Fidesz won a plurality of seats in the [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998 election]], Orb\u00e1n was appointed Prime Minister for the first time.\n\nFidesz narrowly lost the [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]] and [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|2006 elections]] to the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], with Orb\u00e1n spending this period as [[Leader of the Opposition]]. The fall in popularity of the Socialists, exacerbated by Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]]'s \"[[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech]]\", helped Orb\u00e1n lead Fidesz to a [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|landslide victory]] in 2010. Orb\u00e1n formed a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democrats]], giving him a supermajority in the National Assembly, which he used to introduce [[Constitution of Hungary#2013 amendments|major constitutional and legislative reforms]]. Fidesz retained its supermajority in the [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|2014]] and [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|2018 elections]].

he was also Prime Minister from 1998 to 2002. He has also been [[Fidesz|President of Fidesz]], a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] political party, since 1993, with a brief break between 2000 and 2003.\n\nBorn in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Orb\u00e1n studied law at [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]], graduating in 1987. He briefly studied [[political science]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], before returning to Hungary to enter politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989|Autumn of Nations]]. He became head of the reformist student movement the Alliance of Young Democrats (''Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge''), which would eventually become the Fidesz party. Orb\u00e1n became a nationally known politician after giving an address at the 1989 reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and other [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|martyrs of the 1956 revolution]], in which he openly demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from the country.\n\nAfter the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|transition to democracy]] in 1990, he was elected to the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] and served as the leader of Fidesz's parliamentary caucus until 1993. Under his leadership, Fidesz shifted away from its original [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[European integration|pro-European integration]] platform toward more [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] national conservatism. After Fidesz won a plurality of seats in the [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998 election]], Orb\u00e1n was appointed Prime Minister for the first time.\n\nFidesz narrowly lost the [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]] and [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|2006 elections]] to the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], with Orb\u00e1n spending this period as [[Leader of the Opposition]]. The fall in popularity of the Socialists, exacerbated by Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]]'s \"[[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech]]\", helped Orb\u00e1n lead Fidesz to a [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|landslide victory]] in 2010. Orb\u00e1n formed a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democrats]], giving him a supermajority in the National Assembly, which he used to introduce [[Constitution of Hungary#2013 amendments|major constitutional and legislative reforms]]. Fidesz retained its supermajority in the [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|2014]] and [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|2018 elections]].
