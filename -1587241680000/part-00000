Kildare lost the relegation/promotion game against Antrim and remained in the Christy Ring Cup for 2019.\n\n{{TOC Limit|3}}\n\n==Format==\n\nBeginning in 2018, the Christy Ring Cup changed to an initial stage of two groups of four teams. Previously it was a double elimination tournament. The top two teams from both groups advance to the semi-finals. In 2018, teams at the bottom of each group will automatically be relegated to the Nicky Rackard Cup for 2019. In subsequent years, the bottom teams will meet in a relegation playoff to decide the one team relegated to the following year's Nicky Rackard Cup.\n\nThe Christy Ring champions contest a promotion/relegation playoff with the second bottom team in the Joe McDonagh Cup with the winner earning the right to compete in the 2019 Joe McDonagh Cup.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Joe McDonagh Cup in 2018, the Christy Ring Cup was reclassified as tier 3 (it was previously tier 2).\n\n==Group stage==\n\n===Group 1===\n\n====Group 1 Table====\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Pos|Position}}\n!width=150 style=\"text-align:left;\"|Team\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Pld|Games Played}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|W|Wins}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|D|Draws}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|L|Losses}}\n!width=50|{{Tooltip|SF|Score for}}\n!width=50|{{Tooltip|SA|Score against}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Diff|Scoring difference}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Pts|Points}}\n|- style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n|1||align=left|[[File:Colours of Kildare.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] (Q)'''||'''3'''||3||0||0||89||58||31||'''6'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n|2||align=left|[[File:Colours of Wicklow.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Wicklow GAA|Wicklow]] (Q)'''||'''3'''||2||0||1||72||64||8||'''4'''\n|- \n|3||align=left|[[File:Colours of Roscommon.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]] '''||'''3'''||1||0||2||48||71||-22||'''2'''\n|- style=\"background:#ffcccc\" \n|4||align=left|[[File:Colours of Mayo.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] (R)'''||'''3'''||0||0||3||46||63||-17||'''0'''\n\n|}\n\n*'''(Q)''' = qualified for Christy Ring Cup semi-finals\n*'''(R)''' = relegated to 2019 Nicky Rackard Cup\n\n====Group 1 Rounds 1 to 3====\n\n=====Group 1 Round 1=====\n\n{{footballbox collapsible\n|date = 12 May 2018\n|time = \n|round = Round 1\n|team1 = [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]]\n|score = 4-26 -

Previously it was a double elimination tournament. The top two teams from both groups advance to the semi-finals. In 2018, teams at the bottom of each group will automatically be relegated to the Nicky Rackard Cup for 2019. In subsequent years, the bottom teams will meet in a relegation playoff to decide the one team relegated to the following year's Nicky Rackard Cup.\n\nThe Christy Ring champions contest a promotion/relegation playoff with the second bottom team in the Joe McDonagh Cup with the winner earning the right to compete in the 2019 Joe McDonagh Cup.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Joe McDonagh Cup in 2018, the Christy Ring Cup was reclassified as tier 3 (it was previously tier 2).\n\n==Group stage==\n\n===Group 1===\n\n====Group 1 Table====\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Pos|Position}}\n!width=150 style=\"text-align:left;\"|Team\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Pld|Games Played}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|W|Wins}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|D|Draws}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|L|Losses}}\n!width=50|{{Tooltip|SF|Score for}}\n!width=50|{{Tooltip|SA|Score against}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Diff|Scoring difference}}\n!width=20|{{Tooltip|Pts|Points}}\n|- style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n|1||align=left|[[File:Colours of Kildare.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] (Q)'''||'''3'''||3||0||0||89||58||31||'''6'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n|2||align=left|[[File:Colours of Wicklow.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Wicklow GAA|Wicklow]] (Q)'''||'''3'''||2||0||1||72||64||8||'''4'''\n|- \n|3||align=left|[[File:Colours of Roscommon.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]] '''||'''3'''||1||0||2||48||71||-22||'''2'''\n|- style=\"background:#ffcccc\" \n|4||align=left|[[File:Colours of Mayo.svg|border|20px]]''' [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] (R)'''||'''3'''||0||0||3||46||63||-17||'''0'''\n\n|}\n\n*'''(Q)''' = qualified for Christy Ring Cup semi-finals\n*'''(R)''' = relegated to 2019 Nicky Rackard Cup\n\n====Group 1 Rounds 1 to 3====\n\n=====Group 1 Round 1=====\n\n{{footballbox collapsible\n|date = 12 May 2018\n|time = \n|round = Round 1\n|team1 = [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]]\n|score = 4-26 -

Over the next 30 years, the [[European Union]] will encounter with the problem of population aging. In various European countries, the [[working population]] in the economies are already suffering from lack of skills in different [[Job|occupations]] and sectors in the economy. The Public Employment Services are responsible for engaging the inactive people and focus on improving employability according to the challenges that these particular people face in different ages. \n\n=== Globalization ===\n[[Globalization]] leads [[labor market]] to constantly evolving as a result of increasing use of [[mobile technologies]] and connections via [[Internet]]. Business try to increase their value through the [[restructuring]] processes while placing value of business innovations and upskilling of their labor in order to withstand the competition.

Specifically, the shift from [[Primary sector of the economy|primary]] and [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sectors]] towards more [[knowledge-based]] services and activities.

The meetings of the Board take place twice a year in order to promote strategic discussions and make decisions regarding the further activities of the Network.\n\n== Challenges of Public Employment Services in Europe ==\nSome of the challenges that the labor market experiences in relation to public employment services include [[Demography|demographic]] factors, [[globalization]], [[Technology|technological]] changes, [[Labour economics|labor market]] challenge, or a rising [[income inequality]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |last1=Eirom |first1=David |title=The World of Public Employment Services |url=https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-World-of-Public-Employment-Services.pdf |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Demographic ===\nDemographic factors show that population trends will have a severe impact on the labor market. Over the next 30 years, the [[European Union]] will encounter with the problem of population aging. In various European countries, the [[working population]] in the economies are already suffering from lack of skills in different [[Job|occupations]] and sectors in the economy. The Public Employment Services are responsible for engaging the inactive people and focus on improving employability according to the challenges that these particular people face in different ages. \n\n=== Globalization ===\n[[Globalization]] leads [[labor market]] to constantly evolving as a result of increasing use of [[mobile technologies]] and connections via [[Internet]]. Business try to increase their value through the [[restructuring]] processes while placing value of business innovations and upskilling of their labor in order to withstand the competition. Therefore, globalization stretches the importance of reemployment and upskilling of the workers who had been [[Layoff|redundant]] due to restructuring processes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sapir|first1=Andr\u00e9|date=|title=Globalisation and the Reform of European Social Models|url=https://graspe.eu/SapirPaper.pdf|journal=Bruegel|volume=|pages=|accessdate=31 October 2019|via=}}</ref> Public Employment Services in EU are therefore requiring improving the employability of people, support job-to-job transition and support the restructuring process of employers. \n\n=== Technology ===\n[[Technology]] has been constantly evolving, causing the [[Labour economics|labor market]] to shift as well. Specifically, the shift from [[Primary sector of the economy|primary]] and [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sectors]] towards more [[knowledge-based]] services and activities. This means that [[technology]] makes progress and greater [[productivity]] improvements, including the use of machinery, or turning [[Manual labour|manual]] tasks into [[Automation|automated]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation|title=Four fundamentals of workplace automation {{!}} McKinsey|website=www.mckinsey.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> And as it does, the global trends lean towards less employment in [[manufacturing]] sectors. Even though a shift towards [[Knowledge economy|knowledge-based]] services allows for opportunities, there is a risk of those opportunities to be taken unequally to the employees.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-technological-advancement-changing-labor-market|title=How is technological advancement changing the labor market?|last=Brown|first=Steven|last2=Loprest|first2=Pamela J.|date=2018-09-28|website=Urban Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Therefore, public employment services are required to serve as an instrument to offer better opportunities to the disadvantaged ones by providing skills and knowledge to help withstand the technological progress. \n\n=== Labor Market Skill Mismatch ===\nCountries incapability to adapt workers\u2019 skills to the certain unmet demand for labor, limits them to excel in the economy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Skills Mismatch in the Labor Market|last=Handel|first=M|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume = 29|year=2003|pages=135\u2013165|jstor = 30036964|doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100030|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/87714e075db75df452e11c8a25040e673c6dfbd5}}</ref> While under-qualification is an issue mostly in the low-income countries, the advanced and developed countries, including most of the [[European Union]] member states, struggle with an ample number of workers who are actually [[Overqualification|over-qualified]].
