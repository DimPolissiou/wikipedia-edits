The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The [[National Hurricane Center|NHC]] official forecast is light blue, while the storm's actual track is the white line over [[Florida]].]]<!--image stacked below trend-map (same width) -->\n\nA '''tropical cyclone forecast model''' is a computer program that uses [[meteorology|meteorological]] data to [[weather forecasting|forecast]] aspects of the future state of [[tropical cyclone]]s.  There are three types of models: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic.<ref name=\"NHCmodel\"/> Dynamical models utilize powerful [[supercomputer]]s with sophisticated [[mathematical model]]ing software and meteorological data to [[numerical weather prediction|calculate future weather conditions]].  [[Statistical model]]s forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner, by extrapolating from historical datasets, and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as [[personal computer]]s.  Statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting.   Four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones:  [[tropical cyclone track forecasting|track]], intensity, [[storm surge]], and [[tropical cyclone rainfall climatology|rainfall]].  Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem.\n\nTrack models did not show [[forecast skill]] when compared to statistical models until the 1980s.  Statistical-dynamical models were used from the 1970s into the 1990s.  Early models use data from previous model runs while late models produce output after the official hurricane forecast has been sent.  The use of consensus, ensemble, and superensemble forecasts lowers errors more than any individual forecast model.  Both consensus and superensemble forecasts can use the guidance of global and regional models runs to improve the performance more than any of their respective components.  Techniques used at the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] indicate that superensemble forecasts are a very powerful tool for track forecasting.\n\n==Statistical guidance==\n[[File:Isabel2003rcliper.jpg|thumb|right|r-CLIPER for [[Hurricane Isabel]] (2003)]]\nThe first statistical guidance used by the [[National Hurricane Center]] was the Hurricane Analog Technique (HURRAN), which was available in 1969.  It used the newly developed [[HURDAT|North Atlantic tropical cyclone database]] to find storms with similar tracks.  It then shifted their tracks through the storm's current path, and used location, direction and speed of motion, and the date to find suitable analogs.  The method did well with storms south of the [[25th parallel north|25th parallel]] which had not yet turned northward, but poorly with systems near or after recurvature.<ref name=\"models\">{{cite book|pages=288\u2013292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gFiunmKWWAC&pg=PA297&dq=hours+time+used+to+run+ECMWF+model#v=onepage&q=hours%20time%20used%20to%20run%20ECMWF%20model&f=false|title=Global Perspectives on Tropical Cyclones: From Science to Mitigation|author1=Chan, Johnny C.

There are three types of models: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic.<ref name=\"NHCmodel\"/>  Dynamical models utilize powerful [[supercomputer]]s with sophisticated [[mathematical model]]ing software and meteorological data to [[numerical weather prediction|calculate future weather conditions]].  [[Statistical model]]s forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner, by extrapolating from historical datasets, and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as [[personal computer]]s.  Statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting.   Four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones:  [[tropical cyclone track forecasting|track]], intensity, [[storm surge]], and [[tropical cyclone rainfall climatology|rainfall]].  Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem.\n\nTrack models did not show [[forecast skill]] when compared to statistical models until the 1980s.  Statistical-dynamical models were used from the 1970s into the 1990s.  Early models use data from previous model runs while late models produce output after the official hurricane forecast has been sent.  The use of consensus, ensemble, and superensemble forecasts lowers errors more than any individual forecast model.  Both consensus and superensemble forecasts can use the guidance of global and regional models runs to improve the performance more than any of their respective components.  Techniques used at the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] indicate that superensemble forecasts are a very powerful tool for track forecasting.\n\n==Statistical guidance==\n[[File:Isabel2003rcliper.jpg|thumb|right|r-CLIPER for [[Hurricane Isabel]] (2003)]]\nThe first statistical guidance used by the [[National Hurricane Center]] was the Hurricane Analog Technique (HURRAN), which was available in 1969.  It used the newly developed [[HURDAT|North Atlantic tropical cyclone database]] to find storms with similar tracks.  It then shifted their tracks through the storm's current path, and used location, direction and speed of motion, and the date to find suitable analogs.  The method did well with storms south of the [[25th parallel north|25th parallel]] which had not yet turned northward, but poorly with systems near or after recurvature.<ref name=\"models\">{{cite book|pages=288\u2013292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gFiunmKWWAC&pg=PA297&dq=hours+time+used+to+run+ECMWF+model#v=onepage&q=hours%20time%20used%20to%20run%20ECMWF%20model&f=false|title=Global Perspectives on Tropical Cyclones: From Science to Mitigation|author1=Chan, Johnny C.

Mecopterans are sometimes called '''scorpionflies''' after their largest family, [[Panorpidae]], in which the males have enlarged genitals that look similar to the stingers of [[scorpion]]s, and long beaklike [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostra]]. The [[Bittacidae]], or hangingflies, are another prominent family and are known for their elaborate mating rituals, in which females choose mates based on the quality of gift prey offered to them by the males. A smaller group is the snow scorpionflies, family [[Boreidae]], adults of which are sometimes seen walking on snowfields. In contrast, the majority of species in the order inhabit moist environments in tropical locations.\n\nThe Mecoptera are closely related to the [[Siphonaptera]] (fleas), and a little more distantly to the [[Diptera]] (true flies). They are somewhat fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until weather conditions are favorable.\n\nEarly Mecoptera may have played an important role in pollinating extinct species of [[gymnosperm]]s before the evolution of other insect pollinators such as bees. Adults of modern species  are overwhelmingly predators or consumers of dead organisms; they are the first insects to arrive at a [[cadaver]], making them useful in [[forensic entomology]].\n\n==Diversity==\n\nMecopterans vary in length from {{convert|2|to|35|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. There are about six hundred [[Neontology|extant]] species known, divided into thirty-four [[Genus|genera]] in nine families. The majority of the species are contained in the [[Panorpidae]] and [[Bittacidae]] families. Besides this there are about four hundred known fossil species in about eighty-seven genera, which are more diverse than the living members of the order.<ref name=Dunford>{{cite book|author1=Dunford, James C. |author2=Somma, Louis A. |editor=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology: Scorpionflies (Mecoptera) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&pg=PA3304 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |pages=3304\u20133309}}</ref> The group is sometimes called the scorpionflies, from the turned-up \"tail\" of the male's genitalia in the Panorpidae.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scorpionflies (Order: Mecoptera)|publisher=Amateur Entomologists' Society}}</ref>\n\nDistribution of mecopterans is worldwide; the greatest diversity at the species level is in the [[Afrotropical realm|Afrotropic]] and [[Palearctic realm]]s, but there is greater diversity at the generic and family level in the [[Neotropical realm|Neotropic]], [[Nearctic realm|Nearctic]] and [[Australasian realm]]s.

These were mainly wind-pollinated plants, but fossil mecopterans had siphon-feeding apparatus that could have fertilized these early gymnosperms by feeding on their [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]. The lack of iron enrichment in their fossilized [[proboscis|probosces]] rules out their use for drinking blood. Eleven species have been identified from three families, [[Mesopsychidae]], [[Aneuretopsychidae]], and [[Pseudopolycentropodidae]] within the clade [[Aneuretopsychina]].

The proboscis could be as long as {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}}. It has been suggested that these mecopterans transferred pollen on their mouthparts and head surfaces, as do [[bee flies]] and [[hoverflies]] today, but no such associated pollen has been found, even when the insects were finely preserved in [[Eocene]] [[Baltic amber]].

Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as [[transitional fossil]]s, such as ''[[Permotanyderus]]'' and ''[[Choristotanyderus]]'', which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera.

The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.<ref name=IIBD>{{cite book |author1=Hoell, H.V. |author2=Doyen, J.T. |author3=Purcell, A.H. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to Insect Biology and Diversity, 2nd ed |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages= 488\u2013491|isbn= 978-0-19-510033-4}}</ref><ref name=\"GullanCranston2014\">{{cite book|author1=Gullan, P.J.|author2=Cranston, P.S.|title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF5hBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT1345|year=2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-84616-2 |pages=1345\u20131347}}</ref>\n\nThe fore and hind wings are similar in shape, being long and narrow, with numerous cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as [[mayfly|mayflies]]. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The [[Insect morphology#Abdomen|abdomen]] is cylindrical with eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the [[metathorax]]. The [[Cercus|cerci]] consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a [[scorpion]], the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.<ref name=IIBD/><ref name=\"GullanCranston2014\"/>\n\nThe [[caterpillar]]-like [[larva]]e have hard [[sclerotin]]ised heads with mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the thorax, [[proleg]]s on the first eight abdominal segments, and a suction disc or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).<ref name=\"GullanCranston2014\"/>\n\n===Ecology===\n[[File:M\u00e4nnliche Skorpionsfliege 0957.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Panorpidae|Panorpid]] scorpionfly feeding on a dead insect]]\n\nMecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments although a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like [[flea]]s. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, and at least one species, ''[[Nannochorista philpotti]]'', has aquatic larvae.<ref name=Dunford/>\n\nAdult mecopterans are mostly [[scavenger]]s, feeding on decaying vegetation and the soft bodies of dead invertebrates. ''[[Panorpa]]'' raid [[spider web]]s to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume [[pollen]], [[nectar]], [[midge]] larvae, [[carrion]] and moss fragments.<ref name=Dunford/> Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.<ref name=IIBD/>\n\n===Mating behaviour===\n[[File:Panorpa communis copula.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panorpa communis]]'' mating]]\n\nVarious courtship behaviours have been observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting [[pheromone]]s to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses to pick up and place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even [[Stridulation|stridulate]] while approaching a female.<ref name=Dunford/>\n\n[[File:Bittacidae_fg1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bittacidae|Hangingflies]] have distinct mating behaviour.]]\n\nHangingflies (''Bittacidae'') provide a nuptial meal in the form of a captured insect prey, such as a caterpillar, bug, or fly. The male attracts a female with a pheromone from vesicles on his abdomen; he retracts these once a female is nearby, and presents her with the prey. While she evaluates the gift, he locates her genitalia with his. If she stays to eat the prey, his genitalia attach to hers, and the female lowers herself into an upside-down hanging position, and eats the prey while mating. Larger prey result in longer mating times. In ''Hylobittacus apicalis'', prey  {{convert|3|to|14|mm|in}} long give between 1 and 17 minutes of mating. Larger males of that species give prey as big as houseflies, earning up to 29 minutes of mating, maximal sperm transfer, more oviposition, and a refractory period during which the female does not mate with other males: all of these increase the number of offspring the male is likely to have.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gullan, P.

In species that live in hot conditions, the eggs may not hatch for several months, the larvae only emerging when the dry season has finished. More typically, however, they hatch after a relatively short period of time. The larvae are usually quite [[caterpillar]]-like, with short, clawed, true legs, and a number of abdominal [[proleg]]s. They have sclerotised heads with mandibulate mouthparts. Larvae possess compound eyes, which is unique among [[Holometabolism|holometabolous]] insects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Qing-Xiao|last2=Hua|first2=Bao-Zhen|date=2016-06-03|title=Ultrastructure and Morphology of Compound Eyes of the Scorpionfly Panorpa dubia (Insecta: Mecoptera: Panorpidae)|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=6|pages=e0156970|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0156970|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4892548|pmid=27258365|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1156970C}}</ref> The tenth abdominal segment bears either a suction disc, or, less commonly, a pair of hooks. They generally eat vegetation or scavenge for dead insects, although some predatory larvae are known.  The larva crawls into the soil or decaying wood to [[pupa]]te, and does not spin a cocoon. The pupae are [[Holometabolism#Pupa|exarate]], meaning the limbs are free of the body, and are able to move their mandibles, but are otherwise entirely nonmotile.

Mecopterans are sometimes called '''scorpionflies''' after their largest family, [[Panorpidae]], in which the males have enlarged genitals that look similar to the stingers of [[scorpion]]s, and long beaklike [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostra]]. The [[Bittacidae]], or hangingflies, are another prominent family and are known for their elaborate mating rituals, in which females choose mates based on the quality of gift prey offered to them by the males. A smaller group is the snow scorpionflies, family [[Boreidae]], adults of which are sometimes seen walking on snowfields. In contrast, the majority of species in the order inhabit moist environments in tropical locations.\n\nThe Mecoptera are closely related to the [[Siphonaptera]] (fleas), and a little more distantly to the [[Diptera]] (true flies). They are somewhat fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until weather conditions are favorable.\n\nEarly Mecoptera may have played an important role in pollinating extinct species of [[gymnosperm]]s before the evolution of other insect pollinators such as bees. Adults of modern species  are overwhelmingly predators or consumers of dead organisms; they are the first insects to arrive at a [[cadaver]], making them useful in [[forensic entomology]].\n\n==Diversity==\n\nMecopterans vary in length from {{convert|2|to|35|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. There are about six hundred [[Neontology|extant]] species known, divided into thirty-four [[Genus|genera]] in nine families. The majority of the species are contained in the [[Panorpidae]] and [[Bittacidae]] families. Besides this there are about four hundred known fossil species in about eighty-seven genera, which are more diverse than the living members of the order.<ref name=Dunford>{{cite book|author1=Dunford, James C. |author2=Somma, Louis A. |editor=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology: Scorpionflies (Mecoptera) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&pg=PA3304 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |pages=3304\u20133309}}</ref> The group is sometimes called the scorpionflies, from the turned-up \"tail\" of the male's genitalia in the Panorpidae.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scorpionflies (Order: Mecoptera)|publisher=Amateur Entomologists' Society}}</ref>\n\nDistribution of mecopterans is worldwide; the greatest diversity at the species level is in the [[Afrotropical realm|Afrotropic]] and [[Palearctic realm]]s, but there is greater diversity at the generic and family level in the [[Neotropical realm|Neotropic]], [[Nearctic realm|Nearctic]] and [[Australasian realm]]s.

These were mainly wind-pollinated plants, but fossil mecopterans had siphon-feeding apparatus that could have fertilized these early gymnosperms by feeding on their [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]. The lack of iron enrichment in their fossilized [[proboscis|probosces]] rules out their use for drinking blood. Eleven species have been identified from three families, [[Mesopsychidae]], [[Aneuretopsychidae]], and [[Pseudopolycentropodidae]] within the clade [[Aneuretopsychina]]. Their lengths range from {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} in ''Parapolycentropus burmiticus'' to {{convert|28|mm|in|abbr=on}} in ''Lichnomesopsyche gloriae''. The proboscis could be as long as {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}}. It has been suggested that these mecopterans transferred pollen on their mouthparts and head surfaces, as do [[bee flies]] and [[hoverflies]] today, but no such associated pollen has been found, even when the insects were finely preserved in [[Eocene]] [[Baltic amber]]. They likely pollinated plants such as [[Caytoniaceae]], [[Cheirolepidiaceae]], and [[Gnetales]], which have ovulate organs that are either poorly suited for wind pollination or have structures that could support long-proboscid fluid feeding.<ref name=\"Ren\"/><ref name=\"Ollerton\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ollerton | first1 = J. | last2 = Coulthard | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Evolution of Animal Pollination | url = | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5954| pages = 808\u2013809 | doi = 10.1126/science.1181154 | pmid = 19892970 | bibcode = 2009Sci...326..808O }}</ref><ref name=\"Ren\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ren | first1 = D. | last2 = Labandeira | first2 = C.C. | last3 = Santiago-Blay | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Rasnitsyn | first4 = A. | last5 = Shih | first5 = C.K. | last6 = Bashkuev | first6 = A. | last7 = Logan | first7 = M.A. | last8 = Hotton | first8 = C.L. | last9 = Dilcher | first9 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Probable Pollination Mode Before Angiosperms: Eurasian, Long-Proboscid Scorpionflies | url = | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5954| pages = 840\u2013847 | doi = 10.1126/science.1178338 | pmid = 19892981 | pmc = 2944650 | bibcode = 2009Sci...326..840R }}</ref>  The Aneuretopsychina were the most diverse group of mecopterans in the Latest Permian, taking the place of the [[Permochoristidae]], to the [[Middle Triassic]].

The [[Eomeropidae]] is suggested to be the sister group to the rest of the Mecoptera, with the position of the [[Bittacidae]] unclear.

They have relatively simple mouthparts, with a long [[Insect mouthparts#Labium|labium]], long [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandible]]s and fleshy [[palp]]s, which resemble those of the more primitive [[Fly|true flies]]. Like many other insects, they possess [[compound eye]]s on the sides of their heads, and three [[ocelli]] on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.<ref name=IIBD>{{cite book |author1=Hoell, H.V. |author2=Doyen, J.T. |author3=Purcell, A.H. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to Insect Biology and Diversity, 2nd ed |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages= 488\u2013491|isbn= 978-0-19-510033-4}}</ref><ref name=\"GullanCranston2014\">{{cite book|author1=Gullan, P.J.|author2=Cranston, P.S.|title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF5hBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT1345|year=2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-84616-2 |pages=1345\u20131347}}</ref>\n\nThe fore and hind wings are similar in shape, being long and narrow, with numerous cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as [[mayfly|mayflies]]. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The [[Insect morphology#Abdomen|abdomen]] is cylindrical with eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the [[metathorax]]. The [[Cercus|cerci]] consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a [[scorpion]], the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.<ref name=IIBD/><ref name=\"GullanCranston2014\"/>\n\nThe [[caterpillar]]-like [[larva]]e have hard [[sclerotin]]ised heads with mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the thorax, [[proleg]]s on the first eight abdominal segments, and a suction disc or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).<ref name=\"GullanCranston2014\"/>\n\n===Ecology===\n[[File:M\u00e4nnliche Skorpionsfliege 0957.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Panorpidae|Panorpid]] scorpionfly feeding on a dead insect]]\n\nMecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments although a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like [[flea]]s. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, and at least one species, ''[[Nannochorista philpotti]]'', has aquatic larvae.<ref name=Dunford/>\n\nAdult mecopterans are mostly [[scavenger]]s, feeding on decaying vegetation and the soft bodies of dead invertebrates. ''[[Panorpa]]'' raid [[spider web]]s to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume [[pollen]], [[nectar]], [[midge]] larvae, [[carrion]] and moss fragments.<ref name=Dunford/> Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.<ref name=IIBD/>\n\n===Mating behaviour===\n[[File:Panorpa communis copula.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panorpa communis]]'' mating]]\n\nVarious courtship behaviours have been observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting [[pheromone]]s to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses to pick up and place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even [[Stridulation|stridulate]] while approaching a female.<ref name=Dunford/>\n\n[[File:Bittacidae_fg1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bittacidae|Hangingflies]] have distinct mating behaviour.]]\n\nHangingflies (''Bittacidae'') provide a nuptial meal in the form of a captured insect prey, such as a caterpillar, bug, or fly. The male attracts a female with a pheromone from vesicles on his abdomen; he retracts these once a female is nearby, and presents her with the prey. While she evaluates the gift, he locates her genitalia with his. If she stays to eat the prey, his genitalia attach to hers, and the female lowers herself into an upside-down hanging position, and eats the prey while mating. Larger prey result in longer mating times. In ''Hylobittacus apicalis'', prey  {{convert|3|to|14|mm|in}} long give between 1 and 17 minutes of mating. Larger males of that species give prey as big as houseflies, earning up to 29 minutes of mating, maximal sperm transfer, more oviposition, and a refractory period during which the female does not mate with other males: all of these increase the number of offspring the male is likely to have.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gullan, P.

In species that live in hot conditions, the eggs may not hatch for several months, the larvae only emerging when the dry season has finished. More typically, however, they hatch after a relatively short period of time. The larvae are usually quite [[caterpillar]]-like, with short, clawed, true legs, and a number of abdominal [[proleg]]s. They have sclerotised heads with mandibulate mouthparts. Larvae possess compound eyes, which is unique among [[Holometabolism|holometabolous]] insects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Qing-Xiao|last2=Hua|first2=Bao-Zhen|date=2016-06-03|title=Ultrastructure and Morphology of Compound Eyes of the Scorpionfly Panorpa dubia (Insecta: Mecoptera: Panorpidae)|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=6|pages=e0156970|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0156970|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4892548|pmid=27258365|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1156970C}}</ref> The tenth abdominal segment bears either a suction disc, or, less commonly, a pair of hooks. They generally eat vegetation or scavenge for dead insects, although some predatory larvae are known.  The larva crawls into the soil or decaying wood to [[pupa]]te, and does not spin a cocoon. The pupae are [[Holometabolism#Pupa|exarate]], meaning the limbs are free of the body, and are able to move their mandibles, but are otherwise entirely nonmotile. In drier environments, they may spend several months in [[diapause]], before emerging as adults once the conditions are more suitable.<ref name=IIBD/>\n\n[[File:Skorpionsfliege Panorpa communis male genital.jpg|thumb|The raised scorpion-like tail of the male has earned the scorpionflies a sinister reputation, but they do not sting.]]\n\n==Interaction with humans==\n\n[[Forensic entomology]] makes use of scorpionflies' habit of feeding on human [[corpse]]s. Scorpionflies were the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver<!-- observed (by the entomologist Natalie Lindgren) at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility near [[Huntsville, Texas]]-->, and remained on the corpse for one and a half days.

The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, [[Chimanimani Mountains]], Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''.
