On the commander's recommendation, tanks were positioned around the Arg. On the 27th, the tanks turned their guns on the palace. The tank commander who made the request had, in secret, defected to Khalq beforehand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Games Without Rules: the often interrupted history of Afghanistan|last=Ansary|first=Tamim|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2012|isbn=978-1-61039-094-1|location=New York|pages=177}}</ref> \n\nAccording to an eyewitness, the first signs of the impending coup in Kabul, about noon on 27 April, were reports of a tank column headed toward the city, smoke of unknown origin near the Ministry of Defense, and armed men, some in military uniform, guarding Ariana Circle, a major intersection. The first shots heard were near the Ministry of Interior in the New City (Shari Nau) section of Kabul, where a company of policemen apparently confronted an advancing tank column. From there the fighting spread to other areas of the city. Later that afternoon, the first fighter planes, [[Sukhoi Su-7]]<nowiki/>s, came in low and fired rockets at the national palace in the center of the city. In early evening, an announcement was broadcast on government-owned Radio Afghanistan that the ''Khalq'' were overthrowing the Daoud government. The use of the word ''Khalq'', and its traditional association with the communists in Afghanistan, made clear that the PDPA was leading the coup, and also that the rebels had captured the radio station.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hackwriters.com/78RevolutionAfghan.htm|title=Surviving the '78 Revolution in Afghanistan|last=Thompson|first=Larry|date=December 2009|website=www.hackwriters.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019150657/http://www.hackwriters.com/78RevolutionAfghan.htm|archive-date=26 July 2010|url-status=live|access-date=2011-04-06}}</ref>\n\nThe aerial attacks on the palace intensified about midnight as six Su-7s made repeated rocket attacks, lighting up the city. The next morning, 28 April, Kabul was mostly quiet, although the sound of gunfire could still be heard on the southern side of the city. As the people of Kabul ventured out of their homes they realized that the rebels were in complete control of the city and learned that President Daoud and his brother Naim had been killed early that morning. A group of soldiers had surrounded the heavily-damaged palace and demanded their surrender. Instead, Daoud and Naim, pistols in hand, charged out of the palace at the soldiers, and were shot and killed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n===International Reaction===\nIn a May 28, 1978 [[United States|US]] cable<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|date=May 28, 1978 |title=Chinese Ambassador Comments on Afghanistan|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KABUL04337_d.html}}</ref> addressed to its embassies and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretory of States]], Chinese ambassador Huang Ming-Ta is quoted characterizing the new regime as \"''undeniably controlled by pro-soviet communists'',\"<ref name=\":2\" /> and that chairman [[Nur Muhammad Taraki|Taraki]] and [[Hafizullah Amin]] had expressed intentions to be [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonaligned]].<ref name=\":2\" />  Huang Ming-Ta observed that the [[Soviet Union]] had great influence in [[Afghanistan]], and would provide any assistance it might need, but speculated Soviet Union might find it an expensive venture.

The PDPA, divided between the Khalq and Parcham, succeeded the Daoud government with a new regime under the leadership of [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] of the Khalq faction.  In Kabul, the initial cabinet appeared to be carefully constructed to alternate ranking positions between Khalqis and Parchamis. Taraki (Khalqi) was Prime Minister, Karmal (Parchami) was senior Deputy Prime Minister, and Hafizullah Amin (Khalqi) was foreign minister.  The unity, however, between Khalq and Parcham lasted only briefly.  Taraki and Amin in early July relieved most of the Parchamis from their government positions.  Karmal was sent abroad as Ambassador to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In August 1978, Taraki and Amin claimed to have uncovered a plot and executed or imprisoned several cabinet members, even imprisoning General [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Abdul Qadir]], the military leader of the Saur revolution until the Soviet invasion and subsequent change in leadership in late 1979. In September 1979, it was Taraki's turn to become a victim of the Revolution, as Amin overthrew and executed him.<ref name=Arnold>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books/about/Afghanistan.html?id=REwmr2bFYfkC&redir_esc=y|title=Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion in Perspective|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|date=1985|publisher=Stanford: Hoover Institution Press|year=|isbn=9780817982133|location=|pp=74\u201375,77,83,86|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books/about/Conflict_in_Afghanistan.html?id=bv4hzxpo424C&redir_esc=y|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|last=Clements|first=Frank|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781851094028|location=Santa Barbara|p=207|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nOnce in power, the PDPA implemented a socialist agenda.{{Clarify|reason=In what sense: 'socialist agenda' (except changing a flag)? |date=March 2018}} It changed the national flag from traditional Islamic green color to a near-copy of the red flag of the Soviet Union, a provocative affront to the people of this conservative Islamic country.<ref name=Arnold/> It prohibited [[usury]], without having in place any alternative for peasants who relied on the traditional, if exploitative, credit system in the countryside.

Instability remained in Afghanistan, with war still continuing to plague the country for more than four decades after the revolution.\n\nIn 1991, PDPA member [[Babrak Karmal]] from the moderate [[Parcham]] faction denounced the revolution, saying:\n\n:<blockquote>It was the greatest crime against the people of Afghanistan.

On the commander's recommendation, tanks were positioned around the Arg. On the 27th, the tanks turned their guns on the palace. The tank commander who made the request had, in secret, defected to Khalq beforehand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Games Without Rules: the often interrupted history of Afghanistan|last=Ansary|first=Tamim|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2012|isbn=978-1-61039-094-1|location=New York|pages=177}}</ref> \n\nAccording to an eyewitness, the first signs of the impending coup in Kabul, about noon on 27 April, were reports of a tank column headed toward the city, smoke of unknown origin near the Ministry of Defense, and armed men, some in military uniform, guarding Ariana Circle, a major intersection. The first shots heard were near the Ministry of Interior in the New City (Shari Nau) section of Kabul, where a company of policemen apparently confronted an advancing tank column. From there the fighting spread to other areas of the city. Later that afternoon, the first fighter planes, [[Sukhoi Su-7]]<nowiki/>s, came in low and fired rockets at the national palace in the center of the city. In early evening, an announcement was broadcast on government-owned Radio Afghanistan that the ''Khalq'' were overthrowing the Daoud government. The use of the word ''Khalq'', and its traditional association with the communists in Afghanistan, made clear that the PDPA was leading the coup, and also that the rebels had captured the radio station.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hackwriters.com/78RevolutionAfghan.htm|title=Surviving the '78 Revolution in Afghanistan|last=Thompson|first=Larry|date=December 2009|website=www.hackwriters.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019150657/http://www.hackwriters.com/78RevolutionAfghan.htm|archive-date=26 July 2010|url-status=live|access-date=2011-04-06}}</ref>\n\nThe aerial attacks on the palace intensified about midnight as six Su-7s made repeated rocket attacks, lighting up the city. The next morning, 28 April, Kabul was mostly quiet, although the sound of gunfire could still be heard on the southern side of the city. As the people of Kabul ventured out of their homes they realized that the rebels were in complete control of the city and learned that President Daoud and his brother Naim had been killed early that morning. A group of soldiers had surrounded the heavily-damaged palace and demanded their surrender. Instead, Daoud and Naim, pistols in hand, charged out of the palace at the soldiers, and were shot and killed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n===International Reaction===\nIn a May 28, 1978 [[United States|US]] cable<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|date=May 28, 1978 |title=Chinese Ambassador Comments on Afghanistan|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978KABUL04337_d.html}}</ref> addressed to its embassies and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretory of States]], Chinese ambassador Huang Ming-Ta is quoted characterizing the new regime as \"''undeniably controlled by pro-soviet communists'',\"<ref name=\":2\" /> and that chairman [[Nur Muhammad Taraki|Taraki]] and [[Hafizullah Amin]] had expressed intentions to be [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonaligned]].<ref name=\":2\" />  Huang Ming-Ta observed that the [[Soviet Union]] had great influence in [[Afghanistan]], and would provide any assistance it might need, but speculated Soviet Union might find it an expensive venture.

The PDPA, divided between the Khalq and Parcham, succeeded the Daoud government with a new regime under the leadership of [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] of the Khalq faction.  In Kabul, the initial cabinet appeared to be carefully constructed to alternate ranking positions between Khalqis and Parchamis. Taraki (Khalqi) was Prime Minister, Karmal (Parchami) was senior Deputy Prime Minister, and Hafizullah Amin (Khalqi) was foreign minister.  The unity, however, between Khalq and Parcham lasted only briefly.  Taraki and Amin in early July relieved most of the Parchamis from their government positions.  Karmal was sent abroad as Ambassador to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In August 1978, Taraki and Amin claimed to have uncovered a plot and executed or imprisoned several cabinet members, even imprisoning General [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Abdul Qadir]], the military leader of the Saur revolution until the Soviet invasion and subsequent change in leadership in late 1979. In September 1979, it was Taraki's turn to become a victim of the Revolution, as Amin overthrew and executed him.<ref name=Arnold>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books/about/Afghanistan.html?id=REwmr2bFYfkC&redir_esc=y|title=Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion in Perspective|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|date=1985|publisher=Stanford: Hoover Institution Press|year=|isbn=9780817982133|location=|pp=74\u201375,77,83,86|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books/about/Conflict_in_Afghanistan.html?id=bv4hzxpo424C&redir_esc=y|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|last=Clements|first=Frank|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781851094028|location=Santa Barbara|p=207|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nOnce in power, the PDPA implemented a socialist agenda.{{Clarify|reason=In what sense: 'socialist agenda' (except changing a flag)? |date=March 2018}} It changed the national flag from traditional Islamic green color to a near-copy of the red flag of the Soviet Union, a provocative affront to the people of this conservative Islamic country.<ref name=Arnold/> It prohibited [[usury]], without having in place any alternative for peasants who relied on the traditional, if exploitative, credit system in the countryside.

Insurgent groups fought Soviet troops and the PDPA government for more than nine years until the final [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan]] in February 1989. Instability remained in Afghanistan, with war still continuing to plague the country for more than four decades after the revolution.\n\nIn 1991, PDPA member [[Babrak Karmal]] from the moderate [[Parcham]] faction denounced the revolution, saying:\n\n:<blockquote>It was the greatest crime against the people of Afghanistan.

He played with multiple local bands both at school and following school, eventually playing in two different bands with future bandmate [[Robert Plant]]. Following the demise of [[the Yardbirds]] in 1968, Bonham joined Plant, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] to form [[Led Zeppelin]]. With the band, Bonham mostly showcased a hard-hitting [[hard rock]] style, but also handled [[funk]] and Latin-influenced grooves in later releases. Like [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]], Bonham's drum set grew in size following the band's 1969 concert tours, including [[conga]]s or [[timpani]]s and a [[gong]]. His [[drum solo]], \"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\", was featured on the group's [[Led Zeppelin II|second album]] and was a staple of their concerts, often lasting over 20 minutes. Outside of Led Zeppelin, Bonham played drums for other artists, including [[the Family Dogg]], [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Jimmy Stevens (musician)|Jimmy Stevens]] and [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]]. Bonham played with Led Zeppelin until his death in September 1980 at the age of 32 following a night of heavy drinking; the surviving members decided to disband the group out of respect for Bonham.\n\nA mostly self-taught drummer, Bonham's influences included [[Max Roach]], [[Gene Krupa]] and [[Buddy Rich]]. Bonham was also close with [[Vanilla Fudge]] drummer [[Carmine Appice]], who introduced him to [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig drums]]. While primarily known for his hard rock style during his lifetime, Bonham's reputation as a drummer has grown beyond hard rock following his death; he is now seen as one of the greatest drummers of all time. He has influenced numerous drummers, including [[Dave Grohl]], [[Chad Smith]], [[Dave Lombardo]] and [[Mike Portnoy]]. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995 as a member of Led Zeppelin. In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him first in its list of the \"100 Greatest Drummers of All Time\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-77933/john-bonham-37887/|title=100 Greatest Drummers of All Time|last=Weingarten|display-authors=etal|first=Christopher|date=31 March 2016|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=17 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923121340/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-77933/john-bonham-37887/|archive-date=23 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nJohn Henry Bonham was born on 31 May 1948, in [[Redditch]], Worcestershire, England, to Joan and Jack Bonham. He began learning to play drums at five, making a kit of containers and coffee tins, imitating his idols [[Max Roach]], [[Gene Krupa]], and [[Buddy Rich]]. His mother gave him a [[snare drum]] when he was 10. He received his first [[drum kit]], a [[Premier Percussion]] set, from his father at age 15. Bonham never took formal drum lessons, although he received advice from other Redditch drummers. While at school, between 1962 and 1963, Bonham joined the Blue Star Trio<ref>{{cite book|last=Welch|first=Chris|year=2001|title=John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums|page=19|isbn=0-87930-658-0|publisher=Backbeat|location=San Francisco, Calif.}}</ref> and Gerry Levene & the Avengers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bonham|first=Mick|year=2005|title=John Bonham: The Powerhouse Behind Led Zeppelin|page=31|isbn=1-904915-11-6|publisher=Southbank Publ.|location=London}}</ref>\n\nBonham attended Lodge Farm Secondary Modern School, where his headmaster wrote in his report that he would \"either end up a [[waste collector|dustman]] or a millionaire.\"<ref name=d&c>Ian Fortnam, \"Dazed & confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 38.</ref><ref>Chris Welch and Geoff Nicholls (2001), ''John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums'', page 15.[https://books.google.com/books?id=PZvvSN6xHAMC&printsec=frontcover Google books (limited extracts)] Retrieved 7 September 2008</ref> After leaving school in 1964, he worked for his father as an apprentice carpenter<ref>Chris Welch and Geoff Nicholls (2001), ''John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums'', page 18.[https://books.google.com/books?id=PZvvSN6xHAMC&printsec=frontcover Google books (limited extracts)] Retrieved 7 September 2008</ref> between drumming for local bands. In 1964, Bonham joined his first semi-professional band, Terry Webb and the Spiders, and met his future wife, Pat Phillips, around the same time. He played in other [[Birmingham]] bands such as [[Nicky James|The Nicky James Movement]] and The Senators, which made a single, \"She's a [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]]\", in 1964. Bonham took up drumming full-time. Two years later, he joined A Way of Life. After the band's demise, Bonham joined a [[blues]] group called Crawling King Snakes, whose lead singer was [[Robert Plant]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=108}}\n\nIn 1967, Bonham agreed to return to A Way of Life while keeping in touch with Plant. Plant formed [[Band of Joy]] and chose Bonham as the drummer. The band recorded demos but no album. In 1968, American singer [[Tim Rose]] toured Britain and asked Band of Joy to open his concerts. When Rose returned months later, Bonham joined Rose's band.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=108}}\n\n===Led Zeppelin===\n{{Main|Led Zeppelin}}\nAfter the breakup of [[the Yardbirds]] in July 1968, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] formed another band and recruited Plant, who in turn suggested Bonham.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=12}} Page's choices for drummer included [[Procol Harum]]'s [[B.J.

Plant sent eight [[telegram]]s to Bonham's pub, the \"Three Men in a Boat\", in [[Bloxwich]], which were followed by 40 telegrams from Grant.

Appice introduced him to [[Ludwig drums]], which he then used for the rest of his career.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=119}} Bonham used the longest and heaviest sticks, which he called \"trees\".

Nobody else has brought quite that balance of muscle, groove and showmanship.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-20-best-drummers-of-all-time-5199372|title=The 20 Best Drummers of All Time|work=L.A.

For example, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's [[James Miller (academic)|Jim Miller]] wrote the following in 1975, while reviewing ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Bonham...is a steak-and-potatoes percussionist, handpicked, one assumes, for his ability to supply a plodding, stolid, rock-solid bottom\u2014no one has ever accused Led Zeppelin of swinging.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Jim |date=27 March 1975 |title=Physical Graffiti |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/physical-graffiti-245789/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |magazine= |access-date=18 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706022801/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/physical-graffiti-245789/ |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 2012 documentary ''[[Beware of Mr. Baker]]'', [[Eric Clapton]] reinforced the idea that Bonham's playing lacked subtlety, and that Bonham and his contemporary [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] were not equals in terms of musicianship to [[Ginger Baker]], Clapton's drummer in the 1960s rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]].\n\n<blockquote>No, no, no, no, (scoffs). Ginger was nothing like those players. His musical capabilities are full spectrum. He can write and compose and arrange, and he has an ear, and he is harmonic. He is a fully formed musician.<ref>Eric Clapton. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxWDQ-otM2w ''Beware of Mr. Baker'' film, 46:48 to 47:05].</ref></blockquote>\n\nSince his death, however, Bonham's reputation has continued to grow beyond the world of hard rock, and his playing is now commonly recognized by critics and musicians as worthy of close study. For example, [[Modern Drummer|''Modern Drummer'' magazine]] had the following to say about Bonham in 2010:\n\n<blockquote>Like nearly every British rock musician in the mid-\u201960s, the members of Led Zeppelin played in groups specializing in amped-up versions of black American music like the blues, R&B, jazz, and soul. To play that music convincingly, you had to swing, and few drummers in any genre have swung with as much swagger as John Bonham.... Despite all the deserved attention paid to his brilliant soloing ideas, his rhythmic sophistication, or his bass drum prowess, John Bonham was, above all else, a groover.<ref name=\"moderndrummer.com\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Tributes and memorials===\nThe surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited to play [[Live Aid]] in 1985 and employed two drummers, [[Phil Collins]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]], to take his place.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=80}} In June 2017, John Bonham's childhood home received a [[blue plaque]] in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/news/15350468.Led_Zeppelin_legend_John_Bonham_gets_prestigious_blue_plaque/|title=Led Zeppelin legend John Bonham gets prestigious blue plaque|website=Redditch Advertiser|access-date=5 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805181445/http://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/news/15350468.Led_Zeppelin_legend_John_Bonham_gets_prestigious_blue_plaque/|archive-date=5 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2018, on what would have been Bonham's 70th birthday, a statue was unveiled in his hometown of Redditch, England to commemorate him.

He played with multiple local bands both at school and following school, eventually playing in two different bands with future bandmate [[Robert Plant]]. Following the demise of [[the Yardbirds]] in 1968, Bonham joined Plant, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] to form [[Led Zeppelin]]. With the band, Bonham mostly showcased a hard-hitting [[hard rock]] style, but also handled [[funk]] and Latin-influenced grooves in later releases. Like [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]], Bonham's drum set grew in size following the band's 1969 concert tours, including [[conga]]s or [[timpani]]s and a [[gong]]. His [[drum solo]], \"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\", was featured on the group's [[Led Zeppelin II|second album]] and was a staple of their concerts, often lasting over 20 minutes. Outside of Led Zeppelin, Bonham played drums for other artists, including [[the Family Dogg]], [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Jimmy Stevens (musician)|Jimmy Stevens]] and [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]]. Bonham played with Led Zeppelin until his death in September 1980 at the age of 32 following a night of heavy drinking; the surviving members decided to disband the group out of respect for Bonham.\n\nA mostly self-taught drummer, Bonham's influences included [[Max Roach]], [[Gene Krupa]] and [[Buddy Rich]]. Bonham was also close with [[Vanilla Fudge]] drummer [[Carmine Appice]], who introduced him to [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig drums]]. While primarily known for his hard rock style during his lifetime, Bonham's reputation as a drummer has grown beyond hard rock following his death; he is now seen as one of the greatest drummers of all time. He has influenced numerous drummers, including [[Dave Grohl]], [[Chad Smith]], [[Dave Lombardo]] and [[Mike Portnoy]]. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995 as a member of Led Zeppelin. In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him first in its list of the \"100 Greatest Drummers of All Time\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-77933/john-bonham-37887/|title=100 Greatest Drummers of All Time|last=Weingarten|display-authors=etal|first=Christopher|date=31 March 2016|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=17 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923121340/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-77933/john-bonham-37887/|archive-date=23 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nJohn Henry Bonham was born on 31 May 1948, in [[Redditch]], Worcestershire, England, to Joan and Jack Bonham.

His mother gave him a [[snare drum]] when he was 10. He received his first [[drum kit]], a [[Premier Percussion]] set, from his father at age 15.

Nobody else has brought quite that balance of muscle, groove and showmanship.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-20-best-drummers-of-all-time-5199372|title=The 20 Best Drummers of All Time|work=L.A.

For example, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's [[James Miller (academic)|Jim Miller]] wrote the following in 1975, while reviewing ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Bonham...is a steak-and-potatoes percussionist, handpicked, one assumes, for his ability to supply a plodding, stolid, rock-solid bottom\u2014no one has ever accused Led Zeppelin of swinging.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Jim |date=27 March 1975 |title=Physical Graffiti |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/physical-graffiti-245789/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |magazine= |access-date=18 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706022801/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/physical-graffiti-245789/ |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 2012 documentary ''[[Beware of Mr. Baker]]'', [[Eric Clapton]] reinforced the idea that Bonham's playing lacked subtlety, and that Bonham and his contemporary [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] were not equals in terms of musicianship to [[Ginger Baker]], Clapton's drummer in the 1960s rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]].\n\n<blockquote>No, no, no, no, (scoffs). Ginger was nothing like those players. His musical capabilities are full spectrum. He can write and compose and arrange, and he has an ear, and he is harmonic. He is a fully formed musician.<ref>Eric Clapton. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxWDQ-otM2w ''Beware of Mr. Baker'' film, 46:48 to 47:05].</ref></blockquote>\n\nSince his death, however, Bonham's reputation has continued to grow beyond the world of hard rock, and his playing is now commonly recognized by critics and musicians as worthy of close study. For example, [[Modern Drummer|''Modern Drummer'' magazine]] had the following to say about Bonham in 2010:\n\n<blockquote>Like nearly every British rock musician in the mid-\u201960s, the members of Led Zeppelin played in groups specializing in amped-up versions of black American music like the blues, R&B, jazz, and soul. To play that music convincingly, you had to swing, and few drummers in any genre have swung with as much swagger as John Bonham.... Despite all the deserved attention paid to his brilliant soloing ideas, his rhythmic sophistication, or his bass drum prowess, John Bonham was, above all else, a groover.<ref name=\"moderndrummer.com\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Tributes and memorials===\nThe surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited to play [[Live Aid]] in 1985 and employed two drummers, [[Phil Collins]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]], to take his place.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=80}} In June 2017, John Bonham's childhood home received a [[blue plaque]] in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/news/15350468.Led_Zeppelin_legend_John_Bonham_gets_prestigious_blue_plaque/|title=Led Zeppelin legend John Bonham gets prestigious blue plaque|website=Redditch Advertiser|access-date=5 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805181445/http://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/news/15350468.Led_Zeppelin_legend_John_Bonham_gets_prestigious_blue_plaque/|archive-date=5 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2018, on what would have been Bonham's 70th birthday, a statue was unveiled in his hometown of Redditch, England to commemorate him.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge.
