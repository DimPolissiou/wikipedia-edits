From there, it runs eastward, following Copper Creek until it ends just west of [[Mount Sterling, Wisconsin|Mount Sterling]], where it intersects [[Wisconsin Highway 27|WIS&nbsp;27]]. The highway then runs eastward before curving to the north to run along an unnamed creek, which the highway follows to the southeast until it drains into the [[Kickapoo River]], at which point the highway crosses it to run along Main Street in [[Gays Mills, Wisconsin|Gays Mills]].

Smith''' (born 1940) is a [[novelist]], short-story and essay writer who serves as a Dedman Family Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at [[Southern Methodist University]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Cw-smith.jpg|thumb|C.W. Smith]]\nC. W. Smith (full name Charles William Smith) was born in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and grew up in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]]. He received a B.A. in English from the [[University of North Texas]] in 1964 and an M.A. in English from [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1967. After teaching at [[Southwest Missouri State University]], he moved to [[Mexico]] for a year to work on his first novel, ''Thin Men of Haddam''. Published by Viking/Grossman in 1973, the book won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the [[Texas Institute of Letters]] for the Best Novel by a Texan or about Texas and was recognized by the Southwestern Library Association for making a \u201cdistinguished contribution to an understanding of a vital social issue in the American Southwest.\u201d .\u201d<ref>Citation awarded at 25th Biennial Conference, Galveston, TX, October 16\u201318, 1974</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSmith has said that his goal since beginning his first novel has been \u201cto document in a dramatic fashion the cultural conflicts of the American Southwest as well as the universal, existential dilemmas that arise from being human regardless of place and time.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |title=Department of English - Department of English - Dedman College - SMU |access-date=2011-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045311/http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In pursuit of that goal, his second novel, set in West Texas among oil field workers and small-town citizens, sought to portray the lives of young people trapped in circumstances too small for their aspirations. That novel, Country Music (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1975), was optioned by Playboy Productions. The novel was reviewed widely with largely, though not universally, positive notices: \"Smith's portrait of a troubled young man searching for himself he knows not where...is alive, funny, sad, and as real as it can be.\" <ref>Publishers Weekly, May 26, 1975, p.53</ref> \"The characters are convincing. The pace is unusually fast for a [[psychological novel]]. Smith is a writer of growing importance.\" <ref>Sullenger, Lee. Library Journal, July 8, 1975</ref> \"C.W. Smith\u2019s technique has the impact of that of Claude Simon, the Provencal farmer-novelist who creates arresting amalgams of past, present, reverie and locale. Can\u2019t do much better than that.<ref>Levin, Martin. New and Novel in The New York Times Book Review, May 5, 1974.</ref> ''The New Yorker'', on the other hand, posted that \u201cThis novel is easy to enjoy on a cartoon level, but only on that level\u2026\u201d<ref>The New Yorker, September 1, 1975, p. 66</ref>\n\nLargely on the strength of the two novels, Smith was awarded a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship at the University of Texas, where he spent a year working on short stories. He was then hired to adapt the novel to the screen and spend time in Los Angeles working with producers on a script while his family resettled in Indianapolis. When the family returned to Texas, Smith became a reporter and film critic for ''The Dallas Times-Herald'' and subsequently began teaching at Southern Methodist University. His third novel, ''The Vestal Virgin Room'' (Atheneum, 1983), focused on a pair of married itinerant musicians, Mid-Westerners, whose efforts to secure fame in Las Vegas results in a strain in a marriage already under stress due to the loss of their only child. The novel has been optioned by three different producers with three different scripts, one by playwright Jonathan Tolins (\u201cThe Twilight of the Golds\u201d), and the latest by producer Ed Bates with a screenplay by playwright and screenwriter David Dean Bottrell (\u201cDearly Departed\u201d).\n\nSmith then embarked upon a long historical novel based loosely upon the life of an Osage who was called in the press in the 1920s and 1930s \u201cthe world\u2019s richest Indian.\u201d ''Buffalo Nickel'' was published in 1989 by Simon & Schuster after nearly a decade of writing and revision. \"The destruction of native American cultures might be considered by some readers to be a literary dry hole. But this novel, about a Kiowa man who inadvertently becomes an Oklahoma oil millionaire, is a rich gusher of a novel - and consequently disproves any such notions\u2026.This is a big novel, in all senses - the characters and the incidents of their lives made memorably real.\" <ref>Gaughan, Thomas, in Booklist, August 7, 1989</ref> \"Critic Bruce Allen, writing in USA Today, said that \u201cBuffalo Nickel is a delightful rarity: an old-fashioned \u2018good read\u2019 which tells the life story of a likable and interesting character who truly grows and changes....The novel is a roomy, agreeably slow-paced picaresque whose serious themes (the abrading of Indian culture, the gradual disappearance of space and wilderness) emerge with haunting clarity from a prose that continuously suggests and dramatizes, never once breaking into sermon. ''Buffalo Nickel'' may well be the year's best novel..\"<ref>Allen, Bruce, in USA Today, February 28, 1990</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Smith wrote non-fiction as well as novels and short stories. He was, briefly, the ethics columnist for ''Esquire'' and the film critic for ''Texas Monthly''. As a freelance journalist and essayist, his work appeared in magazines and periodicals both scholarly and commercial. A cover article entitled \u201cUncle Dad\u201d published by ''Esquire'' <ref>March 1985</ref> became a full-length memoir about his efforts to remain a part of his children\u2019s lives after a divorce. The book, commissioned and published by Putnam, was also released under the author\u2019s original title in a subsequent paperback edition by Berkley. His nonfiction work has been recognized through various awards: [[Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards|Penney-Missouri Special Merit Award]] for Feature Writing; the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism from the Texas Institute of Letters, and the award for Best Nonfiction Book by a Texan in 1987 from the Southwestern Booksellers Association.\n\nIn 1994, Texas Christian University Press began its long association with Smith\u2019s works through the publication of his short-story collection, ''Letters From the Horse Latitudes''. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in ''Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, [[American Literary Review]], American Short Fiction,'' ''The Missouri Review,'' and ''descant''. Writing about the collection in ''The New York Times'', Benjamin Cheever said, \u201dSet in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today most O. Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing.\" .\u201d<ref>Cheever, Benjamin, in The New York Times Book Review, October 30, 1994, p.42</ref> His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from ''Quartet;'' the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from ''Southwest Review'', as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story \u201cThe Plantation Club\u201d was included in, \u201cSeeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,\u201d published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, \u201cThe Bundelays,\u201d was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts\u2019 \u201cArts and Letters Live Series,\u201d as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.\n\nSmith\u2019s next novel, ''Hunter\u2019s Trap'' (TCU Press, 1996), was designed to be an oblique sequel to the earlier Buffalo Nickel and the second part of a projected trilogy treating the theme of Native American assimilation into Anglo-European culture after the defeat of the Plains tribes by the U.S. military in the last quarter of the 19th century. \u201cSomewhat reminiscent of the stories of Jim Harrison\u2026Smith's novel offers an evocative exploration of the values and character of a time, a place, and a man. It's also a novel that would grace the lists of fine trade publishers, but refreshingly, it comes to us from a university press. Here's hoping that many readers come to know this skillfully wrought tale and that its success encourages TCU Press to bring us more such books.\" (Booklist) \"It's an eye for an eye - obsessive hatred, relentless pursuit and coldblooded revenge for irrevocable loss - in this hypnotic sequel to Smith's highly-praised western, Buffalo Nickel....The plot...moves inexorably to a stunning irony on the final page.\" .\"<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-87565-162-0 Fiction Review: Hunter's Trap by C. W. Smith, Author Texas Christian University Press $22.5 (216p)] {{ISBN|978-0-87565-162-0}}</ref> \"Beautifully bitter Depression-era revenge melodrama in which good guys lose, good women die, and virtue's reward is unreasonable tragedy.\" <ref>Kirkus Reviews, August 1, 1996.</ref>\n\nSmith returned to more contemporary settings in his subsequent novel, ''Understanding Women'' (TCU Press, 1998), a coming-of-age story that takes place in the late 1950s when its sixteen-year-old protagonist and narrator leaves his home in Dallas to spend a summer working for his uncle in the oil fields. The novel won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters from the Best Novel of 1998 by a Texan or about Texas <ref>\u201dWriters Honored,\u201d in Dallas Morning News, April 11, 1999, p., 45A</ref> and also received an award from the Border Regional Library Association as an \u201cOutstanding Book About the Southwest,\u201d and the book garnered a starred review in Booklist.<ref>DeCandido, GraceAnne, in Booklist, September 1, 1998</ref>\n\n''Gabriel's Eye'' (Winedale Publishing, 2001) utilizes Smith\u2019s intimate knowledge of contemporary Dallas to focus upon the affair between a female teacher and her student at a local performing arts high school. While the book did secure mild praise from a reviewer in ''Publisher\u2019s Weekly'', it went largely unnoticed in the press, although the Austin Chronicle gave it a full-length, somewhat mixed review. .<ref>Catmull, Katherine, \"Readings,\" in The Austin Chronicle, May 25, 2001</ref>\n\nSmith once again embarked upon unearthing historical records to produce a lengthy tome based on the riots of 1943 in Beaumont, Texas, when war-time social and living conditions produced racial tension that flared into violent civil disorder when an African-American was falsely accused of raping the wife of an overseas sailor. The book, Purple Hearts (TCU Press, 2008) took seven years to write and went through thirteen drafts to reach its final form. Again, as was the case with his previous novel, the work went unnoticed, though scholar and critic Clay Reynolds has written fully of it. (See below.) The novel was a 2009 finalist for Best Novel award given by the Writers\u2019 League of Texas. HIs short story \"Caustic\" (Southwest Review, Summer 2010) was given The Kay Catarulla Award for \"best short story of 2010\" by The Texas Institute of Letters.\n\nSmith\u2019s most recent novel, Steplings, was published in September 2011 by TCU Press. The novel is a coming-of-age story for a young man from a Dallas blue-collar suburb who allows his eleven-year-old stepsister to run away with him, setting off an Amber Alert that divides their newly married parents.  Early reviews ran from mixed to very positive: \u201cSlow, a little weak in the plot department, but rich in psychological insight and lit by occasional flashes of humor\u201d;<ref>[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/childrens-books/cw-smith/steplings/ STEPLINGS by C.W.

Smith has received just about every literary award the state and region bestow, and his latest work, the sprightly and wise Steplings, will no doubt add to his reputation as a Lone Star star\u2026. Steplings comes to a completely realistic, bittersweet conclusion that will disappoint readers who like their endings tied in neat bows. But Smith is no fantasist \u2014 he\u2019s a writer who can be depended on to write life as he actually sees it, not as he (or we) might wish it were\u201d;<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/books/20110923-book-review-steplings-by-c.w.-smith.ece Book review: Steplings, by C.W. Smith | Dallas-Fort Worth Book Reviews and News - Entertainment News for Dallas Texas - GuideLive - The Dallas Morning News]</ref> \u201cEven though these kinds of relationship dynamics have been mined many times before, Smith's story rings true and never feels stale. A dash of international politics spices up the personal politics of Steplings in a way that isn't forced or incongruent. The only misstep is a brief glimpse into the life of Jason's girlfriend that reads like a long parenthetical to the real story \u2013 a story of bonds between siblings and spouses, parents and children, and the fallout when they pull in different directions\u201d.<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2011-09-23/steplings-a-novel/ Review: Steplings: A Novel - Books - The Austin Chronicle]</ref>\n\nIn addition to the awards described above, Smith has twice received Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. In April 2011 he was given The Lon Tinkle Award for \"sustained excellence in a career\" by the Texas Institute of Letters. He belongs to PEN, The Authors Guild, Writer's Guild of America West, and the Texas Institute of Letters.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''Thin Men of Haddam''. New York: Viking/Grossman, 1973.

Smith''' (born 1940) is a [[novelist]], short-story and essay writer who serves as a Dedman Family Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at [[Southern Methodist University]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Cw-smith.jpg|thumb|C.W. Smith]]\nC. W. Smith (full name Charles William Smith) was born in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and grew up in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]]. He received a B.A. in English from the [[University of North Texas]] in 1964 and an M.A. in English from [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1967. After teaching at [[Southwest Missouri State University]], he moved to [[Mexico]] for a year to work on his first novel, ''Thin Men of Haddam''. Published by Viking/Grossman in 1973, the book won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the [[Texas Institute of Letters]] for the Best Novel by a Texan or about Texas and was recognized by the Southwestern Library Association for making a \u201cdistinguished contribution to an understanding of a vital social issue in the American Southwest.\u201d .\u201d<ref>Citation awarded at 25th Biennial Conference, Galveston, TX, October 16\u201318, 1974</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSmith has said that his goal since beginning his first novel has been \u201cto document in a dramatic fashion the cultural conflicts of the American Southwest as well as the universal, existential dilemmas that arise from being human regardless of place and time.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |title=Department of English - Department of English - Dedman College - SMU |access-date=2011-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045311/http://smu.edu/english/People/FacultyProfiles/Smith.htm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In pursuit of that goal, his second novel, set in West Texas among oil field workers and small-town citizens, sought to portray the lives of young people trapped in circumstances too small for their aspirations. That novel, Country Music (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1975), was optioned by Playboy Productions. The novel was reviewed widely with largely, though not universally, positive notices: \"Smith's portrait of a troubled young man searching for himself he knows not where...is alive, funny, sad, and as real as it can be.\" <ref>Publishers Weekly, May 26, 1975, p.53</ref> \"The characters are convincing. The pace is unusually fast for a [[psychological novel]]. Smith is a writer of growing importance.\" <ref>Sullenger, Lee. Library Journal, July 8, 1975</ref> \"C.W. Smith\u2019s technique has the impact of that of Claude Simon, the Provencal farmer-novelist who creates arresting amalgams of past, present, reverie and locale. Can\u2019t do much better than that.<ref>Levin, Martin. New and Novel in The New York Times Book Review, May 5, 1974.</ref> ''The New Yorker'', on the other hand, posted that \u201cThis novel is easy to enjoy on a cartoon level, but only on that level\u2026\u201d<ref>The New Yorker, September 1, 1975, p. 66</ref>\n\nLargely on the strength of the two novels, Smith was awarded a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship at the University of Texas, where he spent a year working on short stories. He was then hired to adapt the novel to the screen and spend time in Los Angeles working with producers on a script while his family resettled in Indianapolis. When the family returned to Texas, Smith became a reporter and film critic for ''The Dallas Times-Herald'' and subsequently began teaching at Southern Methodist University. His third novel, ''The Vestal Virgin Room'' (Atheneum, 1983), focused on a pair of married itinerant musicians, Mid-Westerners, whose efforts to secure fame in Las Vegas results in a strain in a marriage already under stress due to the loss of their only child. The novel has been optioned by three different producers with three different scripts, one by playwright Jonathan Tolins (\u201cThe Twilight of the Golds\u201d), and the latest by producer Ed Bates with a screenplay by playwright and screenwriter David Dean Bottrell (\u201cDearly Departed\u201d).\n\nSmith then embarked upon a long historical novel based loosely upon the life of an Osage who was called in the press in the 1920s and 1930s \u201cthe world\u2019s richest Indian.\u201d ''Buffalo Nickel'' was published in 1989 by Simon & Schuster after nearly a decade of writing and revision. \"The destruction of native American cultures might be considered by some readers to be a literary dry hole. But this novel, about a Kiowa man who inadvertently becomes an Oklahoma oil millionaire, is a rich gusher of a novel - and consequently disproves any such notions\u2026.This is a big novel, in all senses - the characters and the incidents of their lives made memorably real.\" <ref>Gaughan, Thomas, in Booklist, August 7, 1989</ref> \"Critic Bruce Allen, writing in USA Today, said that \u201cBuffalo Nickel is a delightful rarity: an old-fashioned \u2018good read\u2019 which tells the life story of a likable and interesting character who truly grows and changes....The novel is a roomy, agreeably slow-paced picaresque whose serious themes (the abrading of Indian culture, the gradual disappearance of space and wilderness) emerge with haunting clarity from a prose that continuously suggests and dramatizes, never once breaking into sermon. ''Buffalo Nickel'' may well be the year's best novel..\"<ref>Allen, Bruce, in USA Today, February 28, 1990</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Smith wrote non-fiction as well as novels and short stories. He was, briefly, the ethics columnist for ''Esquire'' and the film critic for ''Texas Monthly''. As a freelance journalist and essayist, his work appeared in magazines and periodicals both scholarly and commercial. A cover article entitled \u201cUncle Dad\u201d published by ''Esquire'' <ref>March 1985</ref> became a full-length memoir about his efforts to remain a part of his children\u2019s lives after a divorce. The book, commissioned and published by Putnam, was also released under the author\u2019s original title in a subsequent paperback edition by Berkley. His nonfiction work has been recognized through various awards: [[Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards|Penney-Missouri Special Merit Award]] for Feature Writing; the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism from the Texas Institute of Letters, and the award for Best Nonfiction Book by a Texan in 1987 from the Southwestern Booksellers Association.\n\nIn 1994, Texas Christian University Press began its long association with Smith\u2019s works through the publication of his short-story collection, ''Letters From the Horse Latitudes''. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in ''Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, [[American Literary Review]], American Short Fiction,'' ''The Missouri Review,'' and ''descant''. Writing about the collection in ''The New York Times'', Benjamin Cheever said, \u201dSet in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today most O. Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing.\" .\u201d<ref>Cheever, Benjamin, in The New York Times Book Review, October 30, 1994, p.42</ref> His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from ''Quartet;'' the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from ''Southwest Review'', as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story \u201cThe Plantation Club\u201d was included in, \u201cSeeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,\u201d published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, \u201cThe Bundelays,\u201d was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts\u2019 \u201cArts and Letters Live Series,\u201d as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.\n\nSmith\u2019s next novel, ''Hunter\u2019s Trap'' (TCU Press, 1996), was designed to be an oblique sequel to the earlier Buffalo Nickel and the second part of a projected trilogy treating the theme of Native American assimilation into Anglo-European culture after the defeat of the Plains tribes by the U.S. military in the last quarter of the 19th century. \u201cSomewhat reminiscent of the stories of Jim Harrison\u2026Smith's novel offers an evocative exploration of the values and character of a time, a place, and a man. It's also a novel that would grace the lists of fine trade publishers, but refreshingly, it comes to us from a university press. Here's hoping that many readers come to know this skillfully wrought tale and that its success encourages TCU Press to bring us more such books.\" (Booklist) \"It's an eye for an eye - obsessive hatred, relentless pursuit and coldblooded revenge for irrevocable loss - in this hypnotic sequel to Smith's highly-praised western, Buffalo Nickel....The plot...moves inexorably to a stunning irony on the final page.\" .\"<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-87565-162-0 Fiction Review: Hunter's Trap by C. W.

The novel won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters from the Best Novel of 1998 by a Texan or about Texas <ref>\u201dWriters Honored,\u201d in Dallas Morning News, April 11, 1999, p., 45A</ref> and also received an award from the Border Regional Library Association as an \u201cOutstanding Book About the Southwest,\u201d and the book garnered a starred review in Booklist.<ref>DeCandido, GraceAnne, in Booklist, September 1, 1998</ref>\n\n''Gabriel's Eye'' (Winedale Publishing, 2001) utilizes Smith\u2019s intimate knowledge of contemporary Dallas to focus upon the affair between a female teacher and her student at a local performing arts high school. While the book did secure mild praise from a reviewer in ''Publisher\u2019s Weekly'', it went largely unnoticed in the press, although the Austin Chronicle gave it a full-length, somewhat mixed review. .<ref>Catmull, Katherine, \"Readings,\" in The Austin Chronicle, May 25, 2001</ref>\n\nSmith once again embarked upon unearthing historical records to produce a lengthy tome based on the riots of 1943 in Beaumont, Texas, when war-time social and living conditions produced racial tension that flared into violent civil disorder when an African-American was falsely accused of raping the wife of an overseas sailor. The book, Purple Hearts (TCU Press, 2008) took seven years to write and went through thirteen drafts to reach its final form. Again, as was the case with his previous novel, the work went unnoticed, though scholar and critic Clay Reynolds has written fully of it. (See below.) The novel was a 2009 finalist for Best Novel award given by the Writers\u2019 League of Texas. HIs short story \"Caustic\" (Southwest Review, Summer 2010) was given The Kay Catarulla Award for \"best short story of 2010\" by The Texas Institute of Letters.\n\nSmith\u2019s most recent novel, Steplings, was published in September 2011 by TCU Press. The novel is a coming-of-age story for a young man from a Dallas blue-collar suburb who allows his eleven-year-old stepsister to run away with him, setting off an Amber Alert that divides their newly married parents.  Early reviews ran from mixed to very positive: \u201cSlow, a little weak in the plot department, but rich in psychological insight and lit by occasional flashes of humor\u201d;<ref>[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/childrens-books/cw-smith/steplings/ STEPLINGS by C.W.

Smith has received just about every literary award the state and region bestow, and his latest work, the sprightly and wise Steplings, will no doubt add to his reputation as a Lone Star star\u2026. Steplings comes to a completely realistic, bittersweet conclusion that will disappoint readers who like their endings tied in neat bows. But Smith is no fantasist \u2014 he\u2019s a writer who can be depended on to write life as he actually sees it, not as he (or we) might wish it were\u201d;<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/books/20110923-book-review-steplings-by-c.w.-smith.ece Book review: Steplings, by C.W. Smith | Dallas-Fort Worth Book Reviews and News - Entertainment News for Dallas Texas - GuideLive - The Dallas Morning News]</ref> \u201cEven though these kinds of relationship dynamics have been mined many times before, Smith's story rings true and never feels stale. A dash of international politics spices up the personal politics of Steplings in a way that isn't forced or incongruent. The only misstep is a brief glimpse into the life of Jason's girlfriend that reads like a long parenthetical to the real story \u2013 a story of bonds between siblings and spouses, parents and children, and the fallout when they pull in different directions\u201d.<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2011-09-23/steplings-a-novel/ Review: Steplings: A Novel - Books - The Austin Chronicle]</ref>\n\nIn addition to the awards described above, Smith has twice received Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. In April 2011 he was given The Lon Tinkle Award for \"sustained excellence in a career\" by the Texas Institute of Letters. He belongs to PEN, The Authors Guild, Writer's Guild of America West, and the Texas Institute of Letters.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''Thin Men of Haddam''. New York: Viking/Grossman, 1973.

According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] world.\n\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&nbsp;\u2014 Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\",<ref name=\"FAarticle\">Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.\n\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post\u2013Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] \"end of history\".\n\nHuntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\n[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.<ref>R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \"Challenging the liberal nation-state?

The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and [[ethnic origins]], that differentiate them from people of other nations.<ref name=Noiriel>{{cite book|last=Noiriel|first=G\u00e9rard|title=Population, immigration et identit\u00e9 nationale en France:XIX-XX si\u00e8cle.|date=1992|publisher=Hachette|isbn=2010166779}}</ref> On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the [[French Revolution]] and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation.<ref>[[Rogers Brubaker]], Citizenship and nationhood in France and Germany, Harvard University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-674-13178-1}}</ref> This is the vision, among others, of [[Ernest Renan]].<ref name=Noiriel />\n\nPresent day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of [[national identity]] sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended.

According to [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]], people's cultural and religious [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] world.\n\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy&nbsp;\u2014 Economics |publisher=AEI |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\",<ref name=\"FAarticle\">Official copy (free preview): {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=Summer 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in response to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his [[thesis]] in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.\n\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post\u2013[[Cold War]] period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]] and capitalist [[free market]] economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post\u2013Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', argued that the world had reached a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] \"end of history\".\n\nHuntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\n[[Postnationalism]] is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including [[economic globalization]], a rise in importance of [[multinational corporation]]s, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of [[socio-political power]] from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the [[Internet]]. However attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.<ref>R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \"Challenging the liberal nation-state?

Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samor\u00e9]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.\n\n== Interests of the parties ==\n{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}\nThe mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.\n* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"\u2026fully operative and obligatory in law\u2026\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>\n* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.\n* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.\n\nThe 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.\n\n== Mediator ==\nBy the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>\n* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],\n* the [[Organization of American States]],\n* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],\n* a European president,\n* Pope John Paul II.\nThe ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.\n<gallery caption=\"Mediator and the heads of state\" align=\"center\">\nFile:Argentina.RaulAlfonsin.01.jpg|[[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]], Argentine Head of State\nFile:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|[[Pope John Paul II]], mediator between Chile and Argentina\nFile:Pinochet crop.jpg|[[Augusto Pinochet]], Chilean Head of State\n</gallery>\n\n== The Act of Montevideo ==\nIn [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo.

This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samor\u00e8 flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.\n* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.\n* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.\n* The final phase began when [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.\n\n== The papal proposal of 1980 ==\n[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]\nOn 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.\n\nChile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.\n\n== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==\nOn 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>\n\n== To the Falklands war ==\nAfter the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.\n\nOn 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediaci\u00f3n] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: \u00abMe calent\u00e9, se justific\u00f3 Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le pregunt\u00f3: Pero se da usted cuenta que el pa\u00eds se encuentra as\u00ed envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?\u00bb'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>\n\nIn March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]].

Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.\n\nCardinal Antonio Samor\u00e8 died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.\n\nPresident [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible.

Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samor\u00e9]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.\n\n== Interests of the parties ==\n{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}\nThe mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.\n* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"\u2026fully operative and obligatory in law\u2026\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>\n* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.\n* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.\n\nThe 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.\n\n== Mediator ==\nBy the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>\n* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],\n* the [[Organization of American States]],\n* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],\n* a European president,\n* Pope John Paul II.\nThe ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.\n<gallery caption=\"Mediator and the heads of state\" align=\"center\">\nFile:Argentina.RaulAlfonsin.01.jpg|[[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]], Argentine Head of State\nFile:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|[[Pope John Paul II]], mediator between Chile and Argentina\nFile:Pinochet crop.jpg|[[Augusto Pinochet]], Chilean Head of State\n</gallery>\n\n== The Act of Montevideo ==\nIn [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo.

This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samor\u00e8 flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.\n* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.\n* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.\n* The final phase began when [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.\n\n== The papal proposal of 1980 ==\n[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]\nOn 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.\n\nChile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.\n\n== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==\nOn 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>\n\n== To the Falklands war ==\nAfter the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.\n\nOn 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediaci\u00f3n] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: \u00abMe calent\u00e9, se justific\u00f3 Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le pregunt\u00f3: Pero se da usted cuenta que el pa\u00eds se encuentra as\u00ed envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?\u00bb'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>\n\nIn March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]].

Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.\n\nCardinal Antonio Samor\u00e8 died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.\n\nPresident [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement.\n\nIn April 1984, [[Vatican Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]] asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution.\n\nBy October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October.\n\nChile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative [[referendum]].

After the Allies successfully held beachheads following [[D-Day]], two prefabricated harbours were taken in sections across the [[English Channel]] from UK with the invading army and assembled off [[Omaha Beach]] (Mulberry \"A\") and [[Gold Beach]] (Mulberry \"B\").\n\nThe Mulberry harbours were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. The Mulberry B harbour at [[Gold Beach]] was used for 10 months after D-Day, and over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The still only partially-completed Mulberry A harbour at [[Omaha Beach]] was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that suddenly arrived from the north-east. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour had to be abandoned.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Dieppe Raid]] of 1942 had shown that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] could not rely on being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed [[Draft (hull)|sufficient depth of water]] under their [[keel]]s, together with [[Crane (machine)|dockside cranes]], to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain [[Operation Overlord]]. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], [[pier]]s and roadways.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Construction of Mulberry Harbours, Southampton, April 1944 A25792.jpg|thumb|[[Phoenix breakwater|Phoenix caissons]] under construction, Southampton 1944]]\nWith the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in the UK and then towed across the English Channel.\n\nThe need for two separate artificial harbours \u2013 one American and one British/Canadian \u2013 was agreed at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R White (Sir Bruce White's brother) to advise on the location of the harbour and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee's first meeting was held at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) on 4 August 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf|title=War Office: Artificial Harbours|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> The minutes of the Sub-Committee's meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then block ships were proposed and finally, due to an insufficient number of block ships being available, a mix of block ships and purpose made concrete caisson units.\n\nOn 2 September 1943 the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, Bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.\n\nThe War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (Phoenixes), the roadways (Whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours.\n\nFor the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the naval Corps of Civil Engineers would construct the harbour from the prefabricated parts.\n\nThe proposed harbours called for many huge [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including [[Wates Group|Wates Construction]] [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]], [[Lend Lease Project Management & Construction|Bovis & Co]], [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|Cubitts]], [[W. & C.

Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the \"Whale\" piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite & Co, West Bromwich and Newport.\n\n===Beach surveys===\nBoth locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning [[geology]], [[hydrography]] and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from [[Stone frigate|naval base]] [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments#S to Z|HMS ''Tormentor'']] in [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a [[LCPL|Landing Craft Personnel (Large)]], or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.\n\nThe special LCP(L) was manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened on 1/2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.\n\nTwo attempts had to be made to take soundings off the [[Ver-sur-Mer|Point de Ver]]. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had issues with their equipment and returned on 28/29 December to complete the task.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1943, a [[Combined Operations Headquarters#Operations|Combined Operations Pilotage Party]] (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at [[Luc-sur-Mer]]. Two soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]], Major Scott-Bowden and [[Sergeant#Royal Marines and British Army|Sergeant]] Ogden-Smith, were landed on the beach at night in [[Operation Postage Able]] and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30\u201331 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.{{sfn|Falconer|2013|pp=69\u201371}}\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Aerial view of Mulberry harbour \"B\" at [[Arromanches]] (October 27, 1944)]]\nAn early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by [[Winston Churchill]] in a 1915 memo to [[Lloyd George]]. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of [[Borkum]] and [[Sylt]]. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.\n\nIn 1940 the civil engineer [[Guy Maunsell]] wrote to the [[War Office]] with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Maunsell_G/maunsellGuy5.asp |title=Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell - WWII : sea forts + harbours |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |access-date=16 March 2020 }}</ref>\nChurchill issued his memo \"Piers for use on beaches\" on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/|title=A User Requirement Document - Piers for Use on Beaches |publisher=Think Defence|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldocuments.weebly.com/hughes-war-plans.html|title=Hughes War Plans - Mulberry Harbours|work=Kaller Historical Documents|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt a meeting following the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[John Hughes-Hallett]] (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] planners.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, the [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Chief of Combined Operations]] Vice-Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], outlined the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.\n\nIn July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (Chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf |title=Artificioal Habours |publisher=War Office |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Trials===\nIn August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:\n* [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] (a civil engineer) who developed his \"Hippo\" piers and \"Crocodile\" bridge spans;\n* Ronald Hamilton (working at the [[Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) who devised the \"Swiss Roll\" which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;\n* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and [[Allan Beckett|Major Allan Beckett]] (of the War Office's 'Transportation 5 Department' (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral 'spud' legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).\n\nPrototypes of each of the designs were built and tested at Rigg Bay on the [[Solway Firth]]. The tests revealed various problems (the \"Swiss Roll\" would only take a maximum of a 7-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). However the final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the \"Hippos\" were undermined causing the \"Crocodile\" bridge spans to fail and the Swiss Roll was washed away. Tn5's design proved the most successful and Beckett's floating roadway (subsequently codenamed 'Whale') survived undamaged; the design was adopted and {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Whale roadway were manufactured under the management of [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]] and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bruce White]], the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.\n\n==Harbour elements and code names==\n\nBelow are listed brief details of the major elements of the harbours together with their associated [[Code name|military code names]].\n\n===Mulberry===\n[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Phoenix-Elements 1 90.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the harbour off Arromanches in 1990]]\nMulberry was the codename for all the various different structures that would create the artificial harbours. These were the \"Gooseberries\" which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. There were two harbours, Mulberry \"A\" and Mulberry \"B\". The \"Mulberry\" harbours consisted of a floating outer breakwater called \"[[Bombardon breakwater|Bombardons]]\", a static breakwater consisting of \"Corncobs\" and reinforced concrete caissons called \"Phoenix\", floating piers or roadways codenamed \"Whales\" and \"Beetles\" and pier heads codenamed \"Spuds\". These harbours were both of a similar size to [[Dover#History|Dover harbour]]. In the planning of [[Operation Neptune]] the term Mulberry \"B\" was defined as, \"An artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches.\"{{sfn|Crawford|1944|p=1}}\n\n====Mulberry \"A\"====\nThe Mulberry harbour assembled on [[Omaha Beach]] at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] was for use by the American invasion forces.  Mulberry \"A\" (American) was not securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry \"B\" had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storms of late June 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omaha Beach Mulberry Harbor|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/project/d-day-1944/results-discussion/omaha-beach-mulberry-harbor|publisher=Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping|access-date=17 December 2015|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> It was commanded by [[Augustus Dayton Clark]].\n\n====Mulberry \"B\"====\nMulberry \"B\" (British) was the harbour assembled on [[Gold Beach]] at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces. The harbour was unofficially named \"Port Winston\"<ref>{{cite web|title='Port Winston' Mulberry harbour built off Normandy after D-Day is uncovered on the seabed 69 years later|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297365/Port-Winston-harbour-built-Normandy-D-Day-uncovered-seabed-69-years-on.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=17 December 2015|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=22 March 2013}}</ref> and was decommissioned six months after D-Day as allied forces were able to use the recently captured [[port of Antwerp]] to offload troops and supplies. Mulberry 'B' was operated by 20 Port Group, Royal Engineers under the command of Lt. Col. G C B Shaddick.\n\n===Breakwaters===\n====Corncobs and Gooseberries (breakwater ships)====\n''Corncobs'' were ships that crossed the [[English Channel]] (either under their own steam or towed) and were then [[scuttling|scuttled]] to act as breakwaters and create sheltered water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the ''Corncobs'' created the sheltered waters known as ''Gooseberries''.\n\nThe ships used for each beach were:\n* [[Utah Beach]] (Gooseberry 1): {{SS|Benjamin Contee||2}}, ''David O.

There were six different sizes of caisson (with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]s of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each<ref>{{cite web|title=Caisson (Phoenix) Breakwater|url=http://worldwar2headquarters.com/HTML/normandy/mulberries/phoenix-breakwater.html|publisher=worldwar2heritage.com|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=|date=}}</ref>) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two [[Type V ship|tugs]] at around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated (\"resurrected\", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Edward Ellsberg]], already well known for quickly refloating [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ships at [[Massawa]] and [[Oran]], was brought in to accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the \"Mulberry\" harbour breakwaters together with the \"Gooseberry\" block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.\n\n====Bombardons====\n{{main|Bombardon breakwater}}\nThe ''Bombardons'' were large {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} cross-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of Gooseberries (scuttled ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} breakwater. During the storms at the end of June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.\n\n===Roadways===\n====Whales====\n[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A Whale floating roadway leading to a Spud pier at Mulberry A off [[Omaha Beach]] ]]\nThe dock piers were code named ''Whales''. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the \"Spud\" pier heads to the land. Designed by [[Allan Beckett]] the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80&nbsp;ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called \"Beetles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|title=Some Aspects of the Design of Flexible Bridging Including 'Whale' Floating Roadways - A H Beckett|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707221355/http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After the war many of the \"Whale\" bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the [http://www.normandythenandnow.com/a-rare-piece-of-d-day-history-in-this-sleepy-normandy-valley/ Noireau river in Normandy], [[Meuse River]] in [[Vacherauville]] ([[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]), as a bridge over the [[Moselle River]] on road D56 between [[Cattenom]] and [[K\u0153nigsmacker]] ([[Moselle]]) and in [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] ([[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three Whale spans from Arromanches were used at [[Ford Dagenham]] to allow cars to be driven from the assembly line directly onto car-carrying ships. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at [[Pont-Farcy]] was saved from destruction in 2008 by ''Les Amis du Pont Bailey'', a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features as part of the Land Warfare exhibition at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].\n\n====Beetles====\n''Beetles'' were pontoons that supported the ''Whale'' piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to \"Kite\" anchors which were also designed by [[Allan Beckett]]. These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckettrankine.com/world-war-2-kite-anchors-found-and-recovered/|title=World war 2 Kite anchors found and recovered|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Spud Piers===\nThe pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.\n\n==Deployment==\n[[Image:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|Wrecked pontoon causeway of one of the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbours, following the storm of 19\u201322 June 1944.]]\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (Gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).\n\n===Arromanches Mulberry===\nAt [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], the first Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between [[Tracy-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Asnelles]] in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.\n\n===Omaha Mulberry===\nArriving first on D-Day itself were the Bombardons followed a day later by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using [[Landing Ship Tank]]s (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulberry Harbours |url=http://www.normandiememoire.com/en/content/view/id-68-mulberry-harbours |website=normandiememoire.com |access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Storm of 19 June 1944===\nBoth harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a large north-east storm at Force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.\n\nThe destruction at Omaha was so bad that the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the Bombardons were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.\n\nThe Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm it remained intact. It came to be known as '''Port Winston'''. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months. In the 10 months after D-Day, it was used to land over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies providing much needed reinforcements in France.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mulberry Harbour|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/mulberry_harbour.htm |website=historylearningsite.co.uk |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> In response to this longer than planned use the Phoenix breakwater was reinforced with the addition of specially strengthened caissons.{{sfn|Hughes|Momber|2000|pp=127\u2013128}} The [[Royal Engineers]] had built a complete Mulberry Harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of [[military engineer]]ing. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.\n\n== Post-war analysis ==\nPost-war (particularly American) historians say that although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first 3 days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with.{{sfn|Godfrey|2003|p=44}} The Normandy Beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:\n \n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | Average Daily Tonnage of Supplies Landed, Normandy 1944 {{sfn|Osmanski|1950|p=57}}\n|-\n!

Up to September, U.S. forces were supported largely across the beaches, primarily without the use of the Mulberry.\"However, in the critical early stage of the operation, had the Allied assault ships been caught in the open without the benefit of any protection, the damage in the American sector especially could have been catastrophic to the lines of supply and communication.\"{{sfn|Antill|Bradford Case|Moore|2011|p=63}}\n\n\"Mulberry B was substantially reinforced with units salvaged from the American harbor and that the Phoenixes were pumped full of sand to give them greater stability, measures that undoubtedly explain the extended service which the British port was able to render.

After the Allies successfully held beachheads following [[D-Day]], two prefabricated harbours were taken in sections across the [[English Channel]] from UK with the invading army and assembled off [[Omaha Beach]] (Mulberry \"A\") and [[Gold Beach]] (Mulberry \"B\").\n\nThe Mulberry harbours were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. The Mulberry B harbour at [[Gold Beach]] was used for 10 months after D-Day, and over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The still only partially-completed Mulberry A harbour at [[Omaha Beach]] was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that suddenly arrived from the north-east. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour had to be abandoned.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Dieppe Raid]] of 1942 had shown that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] could not rely on being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed [[Draft (hull)|sufficient depth of water]] under their [[keel]]s, together with [[Crane (machine)|dockside cranes]], to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain [[Operation Overlord]]. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], [[pier]]s and roadways.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Construction of Mulberry Harbours, Southampton, April 1944 A25792.jpg|thumb|[[Phoenix breakwater|Phoenix caissons]] under construction, Southampton 1944]]\nWith the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in the UK and then towed across the English Channel.\n\nThe need for two separate artificial harbours \u2013 one American and one British/Canadian \u2013 was agreed at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R White (Sir Bruce White's brother) to advise on the location of the harbour and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee's first meeting was held at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) on 4 August 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf|title=War Office: Artificial Harbours|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> The minutes of the Sub-Committee's meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then block ships were proposed and finally, due to an insufficient number of block ships being available, a mix of block ships and purpose made concrete caisson units.\n\nOn 2 September 1943 the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, Bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.\n\nThe War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (Phoenixes), the roadways (Whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours.\n\nFor the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the naval Corps of Civil Engineers would construct the harbour from the prefabricated parts.\n\nThe proposed harbours called for many huge [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including [[Wates Group|Wates Construction]] [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]], [[Lend Lease Project Management & Construction|Bovis & Co]], [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|Cubitts]], [[W. & C. French|French]], [[Holloway Brothers (London)|Holloway Brothers]], [[John Laing Group|John Laing & Son]], [[Peter Lind & Company]], [[Sir Robert McAlpine]], [[Melville Dundas|Melville Dundas & Whitson]], [[Mowlem]], [[BAM Nuttall|Nuttall]], [[Sir Lindsay Parkinson|Parkinson]], [[Halcrow Group]], [[Pauling & Co.]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]].{{sfn|Hartcup|2011|p=94}} On completion they were towed across the English Channel by [[Tugboat|tugs]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thames Tugs |url=http://www.thamestugs.co.uk/BRITISH-TUGS.php |title=Mulberry Harbour: British, French and Dutch tugs' |access-date=20 April 2009}}</ref> to the Normandy coast at only {{convert|4.3|kn|km/h|order=flip}}, assembled, operated and maintained by the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]], under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the \"Whale\" piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite & Co, West Bromwich and Newport.\n\n===Beach surveys===\nBoth locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning [[geology]], [[hydrography]] and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from [[Stone frigate|naval base]] [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments#S to Z|HMS ''Tormentor'']] in [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a [[LCPL|Landing Craft Personnel (Large)]], or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.\n\nThe special LCP(L) was manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened on 1/2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.\n\nTwo attempts had to be made to take soundings off the [[Ver-sur-Mer|Point de Ver]]. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had issues with their equipment and returned on 28/29 December to complete the task.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1943, a [[Combined Operations Headquarters#Operations|Combined Operations Pilotage Party]] (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at [[Luc-sur-Mer]]. Two soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]], Major Scott-Bowden and [[Sergeant#Royal Marines and British Army|Sergeant]] Ogden-Smith, were landed on the beach at night in [[Operation Postage Able]] and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30\u201331 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.{{sfn|Falconer|2013|pp=69\u201371}}\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Aerial view of Mulberry harbour \"B\" at [[Arromanches]] (October 27, 1944)]]\nAn early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by [[Winston Churchill]] in a 1915 memo to [[Lloyd George]]. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of [[Borkum]] and [[Sylt]]. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.\n\nIn 1940 the civil engineer [[Guy Maunsell]] wrote to the [[War Office]] with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Maunsell_G/maunsellGuy5.asp |title=Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell - WWII : sea forts + harbours |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |access-date=16 March 2020 }}</ref>\nChurchill issued his memo \"Piers for use on beaches\" on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/|title=A User Requirement Document - Piers for Use on Beaches |publisher=Think Defence|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldocuments.weebly.com/hughes-war-plans.html|title=Hughes War Plans - Mulberry Harbours|work=Kaller Historical Documents|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt a meeting following the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[John Hughes-Hallett]] (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] planners.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, the [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Chief of Combined Operations]] Vice-Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], outlined the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.\n\nIn July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (Chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf |title=Artificioal Habours |publisher=War Office |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Trials===\nIn August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:\n* [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] (a civil engineer) who developed his \"Hippo\" piers and \"Crocodile\" bridge spans;\n* Ronald Hamilton (working at the [[Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) who devised the \"Swiss Roll\" which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;\n* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and [[Allan Beckett|Major Allan Beckett]] (of the War Office's 'Transportation 5 Department' (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral 'spud' legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).\n\nPrototypes of each of the designs were built and tested at Rigg Bay on the [[Solway Firth]]. The tests revealed various problems (the \"Swiss Roll\" would only take a maximum of a 7-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). However the final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the \"Hippos\" were undermined causing the \"Crocodile\" bridge spans to fail and the Swiss Roll was washed away. Tn5's design proved the most successful and Beckett's floating roadway (subsequently codenamed 'Whale') survived undamaged; the design was adopted and {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Whale roadway were manufactured under the management of [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]] and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bruce White]], the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.\n\n==Harbour elements and code names==\n\nBelow are listed brief details of the major elements of the harbours together with their associated [[Code name|military code names]].\n\n===Mulberry===\n[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Phoenix-Elements 1 90.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the harbour off Arromanches in 1990]]\nMulberry was the codename for all the various different structures that would create the artificial harbours. These were the \"Gooseberries\" which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. There were two harbours, Mulberry \"A\" and Mulberry \"B\". The \"Mulberry\" harbours consisted of a floating outer breakwater called \"[[Bombardon breakwater|Bombardons]]\", a static breakwater consisting of \"Corncobs\" and reinforced concrete caissons called \"Phoenix\", floating piers or roadways codenamed \"Whales\" and \"Beetles\" and pier heads codenamed \"Spuds\". These harbours were both of a similar size to [[Dover#History|Dover harbour]]. In the planning of [[Operation Neptune]] the term Mulberry \"B\" was defined as, \"An artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches.\"{{sfn|Crawford|1944|p=1}}\n\n====Mulberry \"A\"====\nThe Mulberry harbour assembled on [[Omaha Beach]] at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] was for use by the American invasion forces.  Mulberry \"A\" (American) was not securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry \"B\" had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storms of late June 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omaha Beach Mulberry Harbor|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/project/d-day-1944/results-discussion/omaha-beach-mulberry-harbor|publisher=Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping|access-date=17 December 2015|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> It was commanded by [[Augustus Dayton Clark]].\n\n====Mulberry \"B\"====\nMulberry \"B\" (British) was the harbour assembled on [[Gold Beach]] at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces.

There were six different sizes of caisson (with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]s of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each<ref>{{cite web|title=Caisson (Phoenix) Breakwater|url=http://worldwar2headquarters.com/HTML/normandy/mulberries/phoenix-breakwater.html|publisher=worldwar2heritage.com|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=|date=}}</ref>) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two [[Type V ship|tugs]] at around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated (\"resurrected\", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Edward Ellsberg]], already well known for quickly refloating [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ships at [[Massawa]] and [[Oran]], was brought in to accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the \"Mulberry\" harbour breakwaters together with the \"Gooseberry\" block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.\n\n====Bombardons====\n{{main|Bombardon breakwater}}\nThe ''Bombardons'' were large {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} cross-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of Gooseberries (scuttled ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} breakwater. During the storms at the end of June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.\n\n===Roadways===\n====Whales====\n[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A Whale floating roadway leading to a Spud pier at Mulberry A off [[Omaha Beach]] ]]\nThe dock piers were code named ''Whales''. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the \"Spud\" pier heads to the land. Designed by [[Allan Beckett]] the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80&nbsp;ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called \"Beetles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|title=Some Aspects of the Design of Flexible Bridging Including 'Whale' Floating Roadways - A H Beckett|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707221355/http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After the war many of the \"Whale\" bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the [http://www.normandythenandnow.com/a-rare-piece-of-d-day-history-in-this-sleepy-normandy-valley/ Noireau river in Normandy], [[Meuse River]] in [[Vacherauville]] ([[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]), as a bridge over the [[Moselle River]] on road D56 between [[Cattenom]] and [[K\u0153nigsmacker]] ([[Moselle]]) and in [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] ([[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three Whale spans from Arromanches were used at [[Ford Dagenham]] to allow cars to be driven from the assembly line directly onto car-carrying ships. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at [[Pont-Farcy]] was saved from destruction in 2008 by ''Les Amis du Pont Bailey'', a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features as part of the Land Warfare exhibition at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].\n\n====Beetles====\n''Beetles'' were pontoons that supported the ''Whale'' piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to \"Kite\" anchors which were also designed by [[Allan Beckett]]. These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckettrankine.com/world-war-2-kite-anchors-found-and-recovered/|title=World war 2 Kite anchors found and recovered|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Spud Piers===\nThe pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.\n\n==Deployment==\n[[Image:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|Wrecked pontoon causeway of one of the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbours, following the storm of 19\u201322 June 1944.]]\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (Gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).\n\n===Arromanches Mulberry===\nAt [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], the first Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between [[Tracy-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Asnelles]] in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.\n\n===Omaha Mulberry===\nArriving first on D-Day itself were the Bombardons followed a day later by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using [[Landing Ship Tank]]s (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulberry Harbours |url=http://www.normandiememoire.com/en/content/view/id-68-mulberry-harbours |website=normandiememoire.com |access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Storm of 19 June 1944===\nBoth harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a large north-east storm at Force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.\n\nThe destruction at Omaha was so bad that the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the Bombardons were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.\n\nThe Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm it remained intact. It came to be known as '''Port Winston'''. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months. In the 10 months after D-Day, it was used to land over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies providing much needed reinforcements in France.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mulberry Harbour|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/mulberry_harbour.htm |website=historylearningsite.co.uk |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> In response to this longer than planned use the Phoenix breakwater was reinforced with the addition of specially strengthened caissons.{{sfn|Hughes|Momber|2000|pp=127\u2013128}} The [[Royal Engineers]] had built a complete Mulberry Harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of [[military engineer]]ing. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.\n\n== Post-war analysis ==\nPost-war (particularly American) historians say that although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first 3 days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with.{{sfn|Godfrey|2003|p=44}} The Normandy Beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:\n \n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | Average Daily Tonnage of Supplies Landed, Normandy 1944 {{sfn|Osmanski|1950|p=57}}\n|-\n!

Up to September, U.S. forces were supported largely across the beaches, primarily without the use of the Mulberry.\"However, in the critical early stage of the operation, had the Allied assault ships been caught in the open without the benefit of any protection, the damage in the American sector especially could have been catastrophic to the lines of supply and communication.\"{{sfn|Antill|Bradford Case|Moore|2011|p=63}}\n\n\"Mulberry B was substantially reinforced with units salvaged from the American harbor and that the Phoenixes were pumped full of sand to give them greater stability, measures that undoubtedly explain the extended service which the British port was able to render. Furthermore, the planners obviously underrated the capacities of open beaches.  The tremendous tonnage capacities subsequently developed at both Utah and Omaha were without doubt one of the most significant and gratifying features of the entire Overlord operation.\"{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=415}}\n\n==Surviving remnants in the UK==\n[[File:Phoenix Caisson - geograph.org.uk - 1323168.jpg|thumb|right|[[Littlestone-on-Sea]] Phoenix caisson]]\nSections of Phoenix caissons can be found at:\n* [[Thorpe Bay]], [[Southend-on-Sea]] \u2013 whilst being towed from [[Immingham]] to [[Southsea]], the caisson began to leak and was intentionally beached on a sandbank in the [[Thames Estuary]].

The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley.

Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==History==\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]].

Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888.

The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Woodrusher", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Valley_(Virginia)"}
