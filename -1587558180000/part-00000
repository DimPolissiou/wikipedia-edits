The only major competitor in the overnight market was [[FedEx|Federal Express]] (FedEx), which did not open its first international service until 1981, expanding to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]. Nevertheless, the domestic market was extremely profitable, and DHL was the third largest courier behind FedEx and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]].\n\n===Deutsche Post purchase===\n[[Deutsche Post]] began to acquire [[Share (finance)|shares]] in DHL in 1998, acquiring controlling interest in 2001.

Under the contract, DHL was responsible for providing logistics services for over 500,000 products to support 600 hospitals and other health providers in the UK.\n\nIn a 50/50 joint venture with [[Lufthansa Cargo]], DHL Express co-founded a new cargo airline, [[AeroLogic]], in 2007, based at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]].

The ultimate aim was to form a league.

It was noted that they had the playing numbers for two teams and they had \"taken the pick of the amateur players of the district club\". The club would be called [[North Shore Albions]]. On the Thursday night a preliminary meeting was held in the city with 20 players attending with the goal of forming a club that was either a city team or a combination of a city and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team, while a [[Newton Rangers|Newton club]] was also aimed to be formed the following week as there was \"considerable dissatisfaction among the members at the management of the Auckland Union\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Rapid Developments/Clubs Being Formed\n| page = 8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14120\n| date = 23 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090723.2.106.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> It was decided to play a match on the Saturday between the [[North Shore Albions|North Shore]] team and the city team. The match was duly played between North Shore and [[City Rovers|City]] and resulted in a win to the former by 44 points to 22.\n\nChairman of the league, D.W. McLean spoke with a representative of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system. There was no sport in being beaten by 61 points to nil as the North Shore seniors were recently by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team\u2026 the management of the Auckland Union was not mindful enough of the clubs\u2019 or players interests\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union Game/Bright Play and Sparkling Situations\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14124\n| date = 28 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090728.2.11.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ponsonby United Are Born===\nAt a meeting at Leys Institute on 30 July the Ponsonby club was formed.

On the Thursday night a preliminary meeting was held in the city with 20 players attending with the goal of forming a club that was either a city team or a combination of a city and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team, while a [[Newton Rangers|Newton club]] was also aimed to be formed the following week as there was \"considerable dissatisfaction among the members at the management of the Auckland Union\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Northern Union Game/Rapid Developments/Clubs Being Formed\n| page = 8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14120\n| date = 23 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090723.2.106.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref> It was decided to play a match on the Saturday between the [[North Shore Albions|North Shore]] team and the city team. The match was duly played between North Shore and [[City Rovers|City]] and resulted in a win to the former by 44 points to 22.\n\nChairman of the league, D.W. McLean spoke with a representative of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and was reported as saying the following; \"no payment would be made for playing, but the men when away from home would be recompensed for lost time. They would provide players with uniforms free in order that a team might take the field in a regulation costume, not in varied coloured pants and stockings, as is often seen even in rep. Rugby matches. Their meetings would be open to the press and full information will be given to the public of all moneys received and expended...\". He \"spoke enthusiastically of the possibilities of the new code, from which he contended the rougher elements of rugby had been removed, this providing a game which was full of bright play and sparkling situations. The liability of getting hurt had been greatly reduced by the removal of scrums and line-out play\". It was also reported that several prominent players, questioned about why they had left the Rugby Union game said that \"they were tired of the unequalness of the contests under the present system. There was no sport in being beaten by 61 points to nil as the North Shore seniors were recently by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] team\u2026 the management of the Auckland Union was not mindful enough of the clubs\u2019 or players interests\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union Game/Bright Play and Sparkling Situations\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVI| issue=14124\n| date = 28 July 1909\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19090728.2.11.1\n| accessdate = 1 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ponsonby United Are Born==\nAt a meeting at Leys Institute on 30 July the Ponsonby club was formed.

With it, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] had reached previously peaceful Macedonia.\n\n==Background==\nWhen it declared its independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on 8 September 1991, Macedonia was the only ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republic that managed to secede non-violently from the federation. Because of this, Macedonia was considered one of the bright spots in the former Yugoslavia.<ref>\"Success in the Balkans? A Case Study of Ethnic Relations in the Republic of Macedonia\" by Robert W. Mickey and A. S. Albion. Minorities: The New Europe's Old Issue. Institute for East West Studies. New York (1993) p. 58</ref>\n\nAlthough Macedonia had seceded from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as one of its poorest regions, socio-economic interventions undertaken by the consecutive democratically elected governments managed to improve the economic picture in the country. According to the [[International Crisis Group]], there was nearly 3% growth in 1999. The second half of 2000 also saw steady growth, leading to a 5% GDP increase for the year. In January 2001, the government projected a budget surplus for the second year in a row. In 2000 the country's emerging middle class began buying new cars, adding extensions to apartments and planning summer vacations abroad.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\">[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Macedonia%209.pdf \"The Macedonian Question: Reform or Rebellion\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903171432/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Macedonia%209.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }}. International Crisis Group (ICG). 2001</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[ethnic Macedonians|ethnic Macedonian]] majority and the largest minority, the [[Albanians|ethnic Albanians]], have co-existed uneasily both before and after the country declared independence in 1991, their relations have generally been peaceful. All of the successive Macedonian governments have included Albanian parties as coalition partners, and several problems were resolved through political dialogue. The mood was more or less optimistic until the beginning of 2001.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\"/> The main cause for incidents though, was the repression by the Macedonian governments on the use of the [[Albanian language]] in Macedonia and the ban of the use of the [[Albanian flag]]. In 1997 the Constitutional Court forbade the use of the Albanian flag, sparking protests.<ref>{{cite news|title=Timeline: Macedonia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1410364.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2012|quote=1996 \u2013 Sporadic ethnic Albanian protests over curbs on Tetovo's Albanian-language university.  1997 \u2013 Constitutional court forbids use of Albanian flag, sparking protests.

This made them the largest ethnic minority alongside the majority Macedonian population of 1,288,330 (66.5%). In 2001, the Albanians of Macedonia lived largely in compact settlements in the western part of Macedonia, towards the international border with Albania. They also lived in the north-western part of Macedonia, toward the border with the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav]] province of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and the then-UN-administered [[Kosovo]], as well as in the Macedonian capital [[Skopje]] and the city of [[Kumanovo]]. They also comprised the majority of the population in the Macedonian towns of [[Tetovo]], [[Gostivar]], and [[Debar]].<ref name=\"makedonika.org\">\"The Kosovo Conflict and Macedonia\" by Prof. Dr. Vladimir Ortakovski.

New York. 1999 [http://www.makedonika.org/whatsnew/THE%20KOSOVO%20CONFLICT%20AND%20MACEDONIA.pdf]</ref>\n\nSince independence, the Republic of Macedonia had been trying to focus on its internal affairs. The promotion of democracy and harmonized inter-ethnic relations had been defined as the main goal of the new state. Since the first democratic elections in 1991, the Albanians of Macedonia used all constitutional and political opportunities to play a significant political role in the country. There were several Albanian political parties, whose behavior and rhetoric (just as in the case with the parties of the Macedonian political block), depended on whether they were in the governing [[coalition]] or not.<ref>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/biljana.htm \"Between Preventive Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution: The Macedonian Perspective on the Kosovo Crisis\"] by Prof. Biljana Cvetkovska. International Studies Association 40th Annual Convention. Washington, D.C. 1999</ref> Despite these political fluctuations, the Albanian parties were included as coalition partners in all [[post-communist]] Macedonian governments.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\"/>\n\nHowever, systematic discrimination against Albanians still existed. The Albanian flag was banned from public display; the Albanian language was repressed in public institutions. Also, police and military personnel frequently profiled and maltreated Albanians.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1088008.html | title=Macedonia: Local Albanian Leader Complains of Discrimination}}</ref> The [[United States Department of State]] reported that the following forms of discrimination against ethnic Albanians continued to exist in Macedonia: limited access to Albanian-language media and education; poor representation in public sector jobs; poor representation in the police corps; poor representation in the military officer corps; denial of citizenship to many long-time ethnic Albanian residents of Macedonia as well as discrimination in the process of citizenship applications; and unfair drawing of voting districts which dilutes their voting strength.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38b7a.html |title = Refworld &#124; Chronology for Albanians in Macedonia}}</ref> Because of these reasons and many more, Albanians in Macedonia began to demand greater political rights. These included making amendments to the constitution in order to declare the Albanians as a second titular nation of the country, recognizing Albanian as a second [[official language]], and providing state support for the underground Albanian-language university in Tetovo. Albanians also claimed to represent as much as 30% and even 40% of the country's population, not the 22.9% recorded in the official June 1994 census.<ref name=\"fas.org\">[https://fas.org/man/crs/RL30900.pdf \"Macedonia: Country Background and Recent Conflict\"] by Julie Kim. United States Congressional Research Service (CRS). Washington, D.C. 2002</ref>\n\nIn 1994, some Albanian politicians in Macedonia advocated for wider collective political rights. In 1994, a prominent manifestation of these demands was the declaration of an autonomous republic called \"[[Ilirida]]\" in the western part of Macedonia.<ref name=\"makedonika.org\"/> Other pressing issues were the attempted creation of an Albanian language university in Tetovo (1995), declared illegal by Macedonian authorities, as well as the anti-constitutional raising of the Albanian flag in front of the municipal assemblies in Gostivar and Tetovo in 1997. Macedonians considered these two events as steps towards the creation of \"parallel authorities\" of the Albanians in Macedonia.<ref name=\"makedonika.org\"/>\n\n===Macedonia and the Kosovo crisis===\n[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army|U\u00c7K]] insurgents hand over their weapons to U.S. Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in Kosovo, June 1999.]]\nDuring the [[Kosovo crisis|conflict in Kosovo]] in 1999, Macedonia opened its borders to thousands of [[Kosovo Albanian]] refugees who were fleeing into the country. According to figures released by the [[UNHCR|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)]], on 17 May there were 229,300 Kosovo Albanian refugees in Macedonia.

Despite all the difficulties, Macedonia accepted refugees according to international standards until the end of the war.\n\nThe burden of having to address the needs of 360,000 refugees took its toll on Macedonia's economy. Instead of experiencing modest growth as projected for 1999, the Macedonian economy shrank by as much as 10% of GDP for the rest of 1999. Trade with [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslavia]], Macedonia's main trading partner, had collapsed, causing Macedonia to lose one of its most important export markets and a vital source of raw materials. Consequently, a number of factories had to close down, adding to already high unemployment. At the same time, the main transit route for Macedonian exports to most of Europe had been closed, increasing the costs for exports. State coffers, almost empty before the outbreak of the crisis, were now practically exhausted.<ref name=\"unhcr.org\"/>\n\nMacedonians were worried about the impact that more than 360,000 Albanian refugees might have on Macedonia's own ethnic mix. They were afraid that the refugees' presence could disturb the Republic's demographic balance.<ref name=\"articles.chicagotribune.com\">[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-29/news/9903290195_1_macedonian-territory-albanian-yugoslav-forces \"NATO Air Strategy Under Fire: Macedonians Fear Divisive Spillover\"]. by Hugh Dellios.

Initial reports gave conflicting information about the NLA. Macedonian President [[Boris Trajkovski]] claimed that the rebels were primarily [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (U\u00c7K) members who had infiltrated the country from Kosovo. Macedonian officials accused [[NATO]] of not doing enough to disarm the Albanian insurgents, discouraging their encampment in the buffer zone (Ground Safety Zone) area between Kosovo and Serbia, or preventing their entry into Macedonia.<ref name=\"fas.org\"/> The NLA claimed that the rebel force comprised several thousand men, coming mainly from Macedonia.\n\nAfter a month of clashes, by late February, the Macedonian special police units neutralized the positions of the NLA in Tearce and Tanu\u0161evci, temporarily driving them across the border into Kosovo.<ref name=\"mystfx.ca\"/>\n\n=== NATO surveillance of the Kosovar border ===\n[[File:91+02 German Army EMT LUNA UAV ILA Berlin 2016 05.jpg|thumb|German Luna X-2000 drone]]\n\nBy March 2001, NATO forces deployed in and around Kosovo began to interdict rebel supplies from areas under [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] control, with surveillance carried out by [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s.

A combined ground and aerial mission was assigned to [[Bundeswehr|German troops]] along their sector of the Macedonian-Kosovar border. Given the mountainous nature of the terrain, there were many [[Enfilade and defilade|dead spots]] for the observer on the ground. To overcome this disadvantage, the German military integrated the armoured-vehicle-mounted RATAC surveillance radar and the [[EMT Luna X-2000|Luna X-2000]] UAV. The Luna X-2000 flew a total of 175 sorties, and a number of suspected rebels were arrested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/surveillance-an-eye-on-the-balkans-134338/|title=Surveillance - An eye on the Balkans|date=2001-08-07|website=Flightglobal.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Fighting in Tetovo==\n{{main|Battle of Tetovo}}\nIn the middle of March, [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|NLA]] forces reappeared in the hills above Tetovo, a key northwest Macedonian town with an ethnic Albanian majority.

Since the start of the operation in Ara\u010dinovo, NATO Secretary-General [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|Lord George Robertson]] described the Macedonian assault on NLA held Ara\u010dinovo as \"madness\" and \"complete folly\". In a strongly-worded statement, Lord Robertson also urged the government to cease hostilities as Macedonia, he warned, was \"on the brink of bloody civil war\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1401919.stm|date=23 June 2001|title=Nato urges end to Macedonia 'folly'|website=BBC News|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/06/22/macedonia.03/|website=CNN|title=NATO slams offensive in Macedonia|date=22 June 2001|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to NATO representative [[Peter Feith]], as well as to U.S. General Anthony Tata, the Macedonian government decided to ask NATO representatives to negotiate a removal of the NLA forces from the village, in order to prevent possible mortar attacks on the capital city, which was well within range, including the International airport and the oil refinery. According to the official story, despite initial advances, Macedonian security forces did not manage to retake most of the village from the NLA. Also, they claim, the NLA were short on ammunition, water and food - making them more desperate to start shooting targets in the city or activating sabotage groups within the city. According to the first version of the story, the operation was halted and the evacuation was asked for personally by the President, in order to avoid the threat to the capital and to facilitate a speedy resolution of the conflict.\n\nAccording to the second version, supported by Ljube Boskovski and General Pande Petrovski, the halting of the operation of Macedonian security forces happened because of a \"NATO ultimatum\". Namely, according to General Pande Petrovski, who was in charge of the operation on the Macedonian side, he was called by the President called at 9:00 in the morning on 25 June, and was told that allegedly \"NATO General Secretary had called him personally telling him to halt the operation because there were Americans trapped in Ara\u010dinovo\". Petrovski, however, ordered the operation to continue. On page 111 of his memoirs, General Petrovski further states that:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Brigadier general Zvonko Stojanovski the commander of the Army Anti-air Defence informed me that our radars caught 6 fighter planes with course from Italy, through Albania towards Macedonia.

Forum Magazine. 2 December 2004</ref> The policemen also managed to repel all of the attacks made on 11 August.<ref name=\"BorbiSkopje\"/>\n\nOn the third day of the battles, 12 August, under great pressure to act by the Minister of Interior and the Prime Minister, the army decided to intervene in the battle. The army involved itself by sending military helicopters followed by two efficient flights by Macedonian Air Force [[Sukhoi Su-25]]s. The air bombardment, and the consequent approach of the army infantry and armed vehicles, put an end to the advances by the NLA, and brought a turnaround on the battlefield. NLA insurgents withdrew to their trenches and earth bunkers at their initial positions around the village of Radu\u0161a, or escaped to Kosovo.<ref name=\"Radusha Battle\"/> After breaking the encirclement, the army extracted the thirty-five policemen, with their equipment, and repositioned them in a more strategic position at the abandoned buildings on the Radu\u0161a mine road towards Skopje. One hundred and seventy policemen were added to reinforce this new position. The army also reinforced the already established positions for the defence of the Ra\u0161\u010de water springs.\n\nAlthough during the first two days of the battle there was serious lack of coordination between the Macedonian military and police, the army was pressed to intervene to prevent the NLA from taking control of the whole territory around Radu\u0161a. Thus, the NLA failed to connect territories under its control in the Tetovo and Lipkovo regions, which would have created a single \"liberated territory\" in the north-west of Macedonia.<ref name=\"Radusha Battle\"/> On the other hand, the outcome of the battle further fuelled members of the Macedonian police force who were in favour of a military solution of the conflict. On 13 August Ljube Boskovski stated:<ref name=\"Radusha Battle\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"At this moment it is necessary to initiate the largest offensive so far, due to the danger that terrorists will widen the conflict\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Macedonian security forces had a dozen men wounded in the battle but sustained no fatalities. Although Macedonian sources state that there were tens, if not hundreds of dead in the battle, Albanian sources do not give a precise number. However, at the location of the battle, there is a memorial stating \"To the fallen NLA soldiers of 2001\".\n\n===Ljuboten police action===\nOn 10 August 2001, eight Macedonian soldiers were killed in a landmine explosion near the capital Skopje. The blast occurred on the road between the villages of Ljubanci and Ljuboten, five kilometres from the outskirts of Skopje, when a convoy of army trucks ran over three landmines. Another six soldiers were wounded in the explosion.<ref name=\"articles.cnn.com\">[https://archive.today/20130120005108/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-08-10/world/macedonia.planes.1738_1_radusa-macedonian-soldiers-tetovo?_s=PM:WORLD \"Soldiers killed in Macedonia blast\"].

Twenty-seven men tested positive and were detained and sentenced for terrorism. The rest were released. Evidence later indicated that the detainees were subjected to severe beatings, as a result of which one person had to be hospitalised.\n\nThe Ljuboten police action is considered one of the most controversial episodes of the 2001 conflict, and was among the four [[ICTY]] cases arising from the conflict.\n\nThe police action in Ljuboten coincided with the security forces' counter-offensive in Radusa. It was part of the Premier's and Minister of Interior's efforts to resume the general offensive against the NLA which was stopped after 5 July 2001. However, the general offensive was not conducted because on 13 August, one day after the Ljuboten action, the ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian political official representatives in Macedonia signed the [[Ohrid Agreement|Ohrid Framework Agreement]], putting an official end to the hostilities. Although the NLA was not included in the negotiations, nor in the signing of the document, the NLA leaders agreed to disarm themselves to NATO troops.\n\n==Ohrid Framework agreement==\nThe Ohrid Framework Agreement, which was signed on 13 August 2001, put an official end to the armed conflict. The agreement set the groundwork for increasing the rights of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia. The Agreement also included provisions for altering the official languages of the country, with any language spoken by over 20% of the population becoming co-official with the [[Macedonian language]] on the municipal level. Currently only [[Albanian language|Albanian]], spoken by approximately 25% of the population, fulfils this criterion.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecmi.de/jemie/download/Focus1-2002Brunnbauer.pdf|title=The implementation of the Ohrid Agreement: Ethnic Macedonian resentments|first=Ulf|last=Brunnbauer|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|issue=1/2002|year=2002|accessdate=28 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305050053/http://www.ecmi.de/jemie/download/Focus1-2002Brunnbauer.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to the document, the version in English is the only authentic version of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement was preceded by the Ohrid discussions, a series of talks between Albanian and Macedonian representatives, along with representatives from the United States and [[European Union]]. The talks took place in [[Ohrid]] in the south-west of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. The agreement was negotiated by [[Zoran Jolevski]], Secretary General of President [[Boris Trajkovski]]. The Macedonian side was represented by the [[VMRO-DPMNE]] and the [[SDSM]], while the Albanian side was represented by the [[Democratic Party of Albanians|DPA]] and the [[Party for Democratic Prosperity|PDP]]. Although actively participating in armed conflict, the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] did not participate directly in the talks.<ref>[http://www.da.mod.uk/CSRC/documents/balkans/csrc_mpf.2004-07-22.4933876394/04(15)-Chap3-JP.pdf The Ohrid Framework Agreement Negotiations by Vasko Popetrevski and Veton Latifi] (as a [[PDF file|PDF]])</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Ceasefire and disarmament===\n[[File:Monument of the Defenders of Macedonia.JPG|thumb|Monument of the Defenders of Macedonia.]]\nAfter the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the rebels agreed to a ceasefire in June, however there were other agreements in August, before both sides settled on a final one in January 2002. Under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government pledged to improve the rights of Albanians in the country. Those rights included making Albanian the second official language, and increasing the participation of ethnic Albanians in government institutions, the police, and the army. Most importantly, under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government agreed to a new model of [[decentralization]].\n\nThe Albanian side agreed to give up any [[separatism|separatist]] demands and to fully recognize all Macedonian institutions. In addition, according to this agreement, the NLA was to disarm and hand over its weapons to [[NATO]].\n\n[[Operation Essential Harvest|Operation \"Essential Harvest\"]] was officially launched on 22 August and effectively started on 27 August. This 30-day mission involved approximately 3,500 NATO and Macedonian troops, whose objective was to disarm the NLA and to destroy their weapons. Just hours after NATO wrapped up the operation, Ali Ahmeti told reporters attending a news conference in the rebel stronghold of \u0160ipkovica, that he was dissolving the National Liberation Army and that it was time for ethnic reconciliation.\n\nSeveral months after the end of the conflict, some armed provocations persisted. Small bombings and shootings occurred. The most serious provocations happened when three Macedonian police officers were killed in an ambush by ethnic Albanian gunmen on 12 November 2001.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1650954.stm \"Macedonia police killed in ambush\"], ''[[BBC]]'', 12 November 2001</ref>\n\n===Casualties and displacement===\nCasualty figures remain uncertain.

One British soldier was also killed.\n\n===NLA Freedom Museum===\nAs a result of the conflict, some Albanians of the [[\u010cair Municipality]] in Skopje established a 'Museum of Freedom' in 2008, presenting what they consider the battles of the Albanians in the region from the period of the [[Prizren League]] in 1878 until the 2001 insurgency. It is also known as the NLA Museum and commemorates those who died during the conflict. Items include paramilitary clothing and insurgent flags used in 2001. Many Albanians see it as a non-military continuation of the uprising. Former NLA leader turned politician, [[Ali Ahmeti]] stated at the opening ceremony: \"My heart tells me that history is being born right here, in Skopje, the ancient city in the heart of Dardania. Our patriots have fought for it for centuries, but it is us today who have the destiny to celebrate the opening of the museum.

There were also claims that the NLA ultimately wished to see Albanian-majority areas secede from the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldpress.org/0901feature13.htm|title=Macedonia's 'Liberation' Army|date=20 June 2001|publisher=World Press Review|accessdate=18 April 2012|location=Zurich}}</ref> though high-ranking members of the group have denied this.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/> The conflict lasted throughout most of the year, although overall casualties remained limited to several dozen individuals on either side, according to sources from both sides of the conflict. With it, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] had reached previously peaceful Macedonia.\n\n==Background==\nWhen it declared its independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on 8 September 1991, Macedonia was the only ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republic that managed to secede non-violently from the federation. Because of this, Macedonia was considered one of the bright spots in the former Yugoslavia.<ref>\"Success in the Balkans? A Case Study of Ethnic Relations in the Republic of Macedonia\" by Robert W. Mickey and A. S. Albion. Minorities: The New Europe's Old Issue. Institute for East West Studies. New York (1993) p. 58</ref>\n\nAlthough Macedonia had seceded from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as one of its poorest regions, socio-economic interventions undertaken by the consecutive democratically elected governments managed to improve the economic picture in the country. According to the [[International Crisis Group]], there was nearly 3% growth in 1999. The second half of 2000 also saw steady growth, leading to a 5% GDP increase for the year. In January 2001, the government projected a budget surplus for the second year in a row. In 2000 the country's emerging middle class began buying new cars, adding extensions to apartments and planning summer vacations abroad.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\">[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Macedonia%209.pdf \"The Macedonian Question: Reform or Rebellion\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903171432/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Macedonia%209.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }}. International Crisis Group (ICG). 2001</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[ethnic Macedonians|ethnic Macedonian]] majority and the largest minority, the [[Albanians|ethnic Albanians]], have co-existed uneasily both before and after the country declared independence in 1991, their relations have generally been peaceful. All of the successive Macedonian governments have included Albanian parties as coalition partners, and several problems were resolved through political dialogue. The mood was more or less optimistic until the beginning of 2001.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\"/> The main cause for incidents though, was the repression by the Macedonian governments on the use of the [[Albanian language]] in Macedonia and the ban of the use of the [[Albanian flag]]. In 1997 the Constitutional Court forbade the use of the Albanian flag, sparking protests.<ref>{{cite news|title=Timeline: Macedonia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1410364.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2012|quote=1996 \u2013 Sporadic ethnic Albanian protests over curbs on Tetovo's Albanian-language university.  1997 \u2013 Constitutional court forbids use of Albanian flag, sparking protests.

This made them the largest ethnic minority alongside the majority Macedonian population of 1,288,330 (66.5%). In 2001, the Albanians of Macedonia lived largely in compact settlements in the western part of Macedonia, towards the international border with Albania. They also lived in the north-western part of Macedonia, toward the border with the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav]] province of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and the then-UN-administered [[Kosovo]], as well as in the Macedonian capital [[Skopje]] and the city of [[Kumanovo]]. They also comprised the majority of the population in the Macedonian towns of [[Tetovo]], [[Gostivar]], and [[Debar]].<ref name=\"makedonika.org\">\"The Kosovo Conflict and Macedonia\" by Prof. Dr. Vladimir Ortakovski.

New York. 1999 [http://www.makedonika.org/whatsnew/THE%20KOSOVO%20CONFLICT%20AND%20MACEDONIA.pdf]</ref>\n\nSince independence, the Republic of Macedonia had been trying to focus on its internal affairs. The promotion of democracy and harmonized inter-ethnic relations had been defined as the main goal of the new state. Since the first democratic elections in 1991, the Albanians of Macedonia used all constitutional and political opportunities to play a significant political role in the country. There were several Albanian political parties, whose behavior and rhetoric (just as in the case with the parties of the Macedonian political block), depended on whether they were in the governing [[coalition]] or not.<ref>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/biljana.htm \"Between Preventive Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution: The Macedonian Perspective on the Kosovo Crisis\"] by Prof. Biljana Cvetkovska. International Studies Association 40th Annual Convention. Washington, D.C. 1999</ref> Despite these political fluctuations, the Albanian parties were included as coalition partners in all [[post-communist]] Macedonian governments.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\"/>\n\nHowever, systematic discrimination against Albanians still existed. The Albanian flag was banned from public display; the Albanian language was repressed in public institutions. Also, police and military personnel frequently profiled and maltreated Albanians.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1088008.html | title=Macedonia: Local Albanian Leader Complains of Discrimination}}</ref> The [[United States Department of State]] reported that the following forms of discrimination against ethnic Albanians continued to exist in Macedonia: limited access to Albanian-language media and education; poor representation in public sector jobs; poor representation in the police corps; poor representation in the military officer corps; denial of citizenship to many long-time ethnic Albanian residents of Macedonia as well as discrimination in the process of citizenship applications; and unfair drawing of voting districts which dilutes their voting strength.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38b7a.html |title = Refworld &#124; Chronology for Albanians in Macedonia}}</ref> Because of these reasons and many more, Albanians in Macedonia began to demand greater political rights. These included making amendments to the constitution in order to declare the Albanians as a second titular nation of the country, recognizing Albanian as a second [[official language]], and providing state support for the underground Albanian-language university in Tetovo. Albanians also claimed to represent as much as 30% and even 40% of the country's population, not the 22.9% recorded in the official June 1994 census.<ref name=\"fas.org\">[https://fas.org/man/crs/RL30900.pdf \"Macedonia: Country Background and Recent Conflict\"] by Julie Kim. United States Congressional Research Service (CRS). Washington, D.C. 2002</ref>\n\nIn 1994, some Albanian politicians in Macedonia advocated for wider collective political rights. In 1994, a prominent manifestation of these demands was the declaration of an autonomous republic called \"[[Ilirida]]\" in the western part of Macedonia.<ref name=\"makedonika.org\"/> Other pressing issues were the attempted creation of an Albanian language university in Tetovo (1995), declared illegal by Macedonian authorities, as well as the anti-constitutional raising of the Albanian flag in front of the municipal assemblies in Gostivar and Tetovo in 1997. Macedonians considered these two events as steps towards the creation of \"parallel authorities\" of the Albanians in Macedonia.<ref name=\"makedonika.org\"/>\n\n===Macedonia and the Kosovo crisis===\n[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army|U\u00c7K]] insurgents hand over their weapons to U.S. Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in Kosovo, June 1999.]]\nDuring the [[Kosovo crisis|conflict in Kosovo]] in 1999, Macedonia opened its borders to thousands of [[Kosovo Albanian]] refugees who were fleeing into the country. According to figures released by the [[UNHCR|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)]], on 17 May there were 229,300 Kosovo Albanian refugees in Macedonia. The number of Albanian refugees in Macedonia at that stage was more than 11% of the country's population.<ref name=\"unhcr.org\">[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,ICG,,MKD,3de62e004,0.html \"MACEDONIA: TOWARDS DESTABILISATION?

United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. 2001 [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3b31e166c.html]</ref> Kosovo Albanian refugees repatriated in the second half of 1999.\n\nMacedonia's ability to receive refugees was limited, because contingency planning assumed only 20,000 refugees. Despite all the difficulties, Macedonia accepted refugees according to international standards until the end of the war.\n\nThe burden of having to address the needs of 360,000 refugees took its toll on Macedonia's economy. Instead of experiencing modest growth as projected for 1999, the Macedonian economy shrank by as much as 10% of GDP for the rest of 1999. Trade with [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslavia]], Macedonia's main trading partner, had collapsed, causing Macedonia to lose one of its most important export markets and a vital source of raw materials. Consequently, a number of factories had to close down, adding to already high unemployment. At the same time, the main transit route for Macedonian exports to most of Europe had been closed, increasing the costs for exports. State coffers, almost empty before the outbreak of the crisis, were now practically exhausted.<ref name=\"unhcr.org\"/>\n\nMacedonians were worried about the impact that more than 360,000 Albanian refugees might have on Macedonia's own ethnic mix. They were afraid that the refugees' presence could disturb the Republic's demographic balance.<ref name=\"articles.chicagotribune.com\">[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-29/news/9903290195_1_macedonian-territory-albanian-yugoslav-forces \"NATO Air Strategy Under Fire: Macedonians Fear Divisive Spillover\"]. by Hugh Dellios.

These events appeared to catch the Macedonian government and the international community by surprise.<ref name=\"fas.org\"/>{{dead link|date=November 2017}} The first attacks occurred in the small village of Tanu\u0161evci, located in northern Macedonia near the border with Kosovo.\n\nThe conflict began on 22 January 2001, when a group of armed Albanians attacked the police station of the village [[Tearce]] near [[Tetovo]], killing a police officer and injuring three others.<ref name=\"mystfx.ca\">{{cite book|title=The Macedonian Conflict Of 2001: Between Successful Diplomacy, Rhetoric And Terror|last=Daskalovski|first=Zidas|publisher=Centre for Post-Communist Studies, St. Francis Xavier University|year=2004|url=http://www.mystfx.ca/pinstitutes/cpcs/studies-in-post-communism/Daskalovski2004.pdf|access-date=5 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503090057/http://www.mystfx.ca/pinstitutes/cpcs/studies-in-post-communism/Daskalovski2004.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Arben Xhaferi]], leader of the [[Democratic Party of Albanians]], which was a part of the Macedonian government, criticized the attack against the police station and said the following:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The Tetovo incident is part of an orchestrated action against the government and a very crude attempt to overthrow it.

This is a deeply anti-Macedonian act, but also an act against the interests of the Albanians in Macedonia\".<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the same month, a group calling itself the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|National Liberation Army (NLA)]] claimed responsibility for the attacks against the police. Initial reports gave conflicting information about the NLA. Macedonian President [[Boris Trajkovski]] claimed that the rebels were primarily [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (U\u00c7K) members who had infiltrated the country from Kosovo. Macedonian officials accused [[NATO]] of not doing enough to disarm the Albanian insurgents, discouraging their encampment in the buffer zone (Ground Safety Zone) area between Kosovo and Serbia, or preventing their entry into Macedonia.<ref name=\"fas.org\"/> The NLA claimed that the rebel force comprised several thousand men, coming mainly from Macedonia.\n\nAfter a month of clashes, by late February, the Macedonian special police units neutralized the positions of the NLA in Tearce and Tanu\u0161evci, temporarily driving them across the border into Kosovo.<ref name=\"mystfx.ca\"/>\n\n=== NATO surveillance of the Kosovar border ===\n[[File:91+02 German Army EMT LUNA UAV ILA Berlin 2016 05.jpg|thumb|German Luna X-2000 drone]]\n\nBy March 2001, NATO forces deployed in and around Kosovo began to interdict rebel supplies from areas under [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] control, with surveillance carried out by [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s. [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predators]] from the 11th Reconnaissance squadron were moved to the [[Skopje International Airport|Skopje airport]] and later replaced by Task Force Hunter, a drone unit made up of [[IAI RQ-5 Hunter]] unmanned aircraft. A combined ground and aerial mission was assigned to [[Bundeswehr|German troops]] along their sector of the Macedonian-Kosovar border. Given the mountainous nature of the terrain, there were many [[Enfilade and defilade|dead spots]] for the observer on the ground. To overcome this disadvantage, the German military integrated the armoured-vehicle-mounted RATAC surveillance radar and the [[EMT Luna X-2000|Luna X-2000]] UAV.

Since the start of the operation in Ara\u010dinovo, NATO Secretary-General [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|Lord George Robertson]] described the Macedonian assault on NLA held Ara\u010dinovo as \"madness\" and \"complete folly\". In a strongly-worded statement, Lord Robertson also urged the government to cease hostilities as Macedonia, he warned, was \"on the brink of bloody civil war\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1401919.stm|date=23 June 2001|title=Nato urges end to Macedonia 'folly'|website=BBC News|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/06/22/macedonia.03/|website=CNN|title=NATO slams offensive in Macedonia|date=22 June 2001|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to NATO representative [[Peter Feith]], as well as to U.S. General Anthony Tata, the Macedonian government decided to ask NATO representatives to negotiate a removal of the NLA forces from the village, in order to prevent possible mortar attacks on the capital city, which was well within range, including the International airport and the oil refinery. According to the official story, despite initial advances, Macedonian security forces did not manage to retake most of the village from the NLA. Also, they claim, the NLA were short on ammunition, water and food - making them more desperate to start shooting targets in the city or activating sabotage groups within the city. According to the first version of the story, the operation was halted and the evacuation was asked for personally by the President, in order to avoid the threat to the capital and to facilitate a speedy resolution of the conflict.\n\nAccording to the second version, supported by Ljube Boskovski and General Pande Petrovski, the halting of the operation of Macedonian security forces happened because of a \"NATO ultimatum\". Namely, according to General Pande Petrovski, who was in charge of the operation on the Macedonian side, he was called by the President called at 9:00 in the morning on 25 June, and was told that allegedly \"NATO General Secretary had called him personally telling him to halt the operation because there were Americans trapped in Ara\u010dinovo\". Petrovski, however, ordered the operation to continue. On page 111 of his memoirs, General Petrovski further states that:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Brigadier general Zvonko Stojanovski the commander of the Army Anti-air Defence informed me that our radars caught 6 fighter planes with course from Italy, through Albania towards Macedonia. I told him to follow their course and to dislocate the helicopters to the reserve airfield in Lozovo. I then thought to myself \u2013 this is it! NATO is ready to use force on us if we continue with the operation\". \n</blockquote>\n\nPetrovski's description of these circumstances have recently been connected with statements done by [[Glenn Nye]], a state department official in the U.S. Embassy in Macedonia. Namely, during the 2002 congressional elections in the US, Nye revealed that while assigned to Macedonia and Kosovo, in 2001 he organised the rescue of twenty-six American citizens who were trapped behind insurgent lines.<ref name=\"Glenn Nye\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmfus.org/expert/experts_dirc/glenn-nye/|title=Glenn Nye|work=German Marshall Fund of the United States|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref><ref>\"\u041a\u0410\u041a\u041e \u0413\u041b\u0415\u041d \u041d\u0410\u0408 \u0413\u0418 \u0421\u041f\u0410\u0421\u0423\u0412\u0410\u041b \u0410\u041c\u0415\u0420\u0418\u041a\u0410\u041d\u0426\u0418\u0422\u0415 \u041e\u0414 \u0410\u0420\u0410\u0427\u0418\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\". \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438. \u0413\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441. 2007 [http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=123A84A87F89AA4A87E4FF661DC50586]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Svet/Spasavanje-Amerikanaca-u-Arachinovu.sr.html|title=\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430 \u0443 \u0410\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/glenn-nye-va/|title=Login|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nResearchers Mark Curtis and Scott Taylor, claim that the foreigners who Nye mentions were advisors from the American military company MPRI.<ref>\"Secret Affairs: Britain's Collusion with Radical Islam\".

The army involved itself by sending military helicopters followed by two efficient flights by Macedonian Air Force [[Sukhoi Su-25]]s. The air bombardment, and the consequent approach of the army infantry and armed vehicles, put an end to the advances by the NLA, and brought a turnaround on the battlefield. NLA insurgents withdrew to their trenches and earth bunkers at their initial positions around the village of Radu\u0161a, or escaped to Kosovo.<ref name=\"Radusha Battle\"/> After breaking the encirclement, the army extracted the thirty-five policemen, with their equipment, and repositioned them in a more strategic position at the abandoned buildings on the Radu\u0161a mine road towards Skopje. One hundred and seventy policemen were added to reinforce this new position. The army also reinforced the already established positions for the defence of the Ra\u0161\u010de water springs.\n\nAlthough during the first two days of the battle there was serious lack of coordination between the Macedonian military and police, the army was pressed to intervene to prevent the NLA from taking control of the whole territory around Radu\u0161a. Thus, the NLA failed to connect territories under its control in the Tetovo and Lipkovo regions, which would have created a single \"liberated territory\" in the north-west of Macedonia.<ref name=\"Radusha Battle\"/> On the other hand, the outcome of the battle further fuelled members of the Macedonian police force who were in favour of a military solution of the conflict. On 13 August Ljube Boskovski stated:<ref name=\"Radusha Battle\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"At this moment it is necessary to initiate the largest offensive so far, due to the danger that terrorists will widen the conflict\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Macedonian security forces had a dozen men wounded in the battle but sustained no fatalities. Although Macedonian sources state that there were tens, if not hundreds of dead in the battle, Albanian sources do not give a precise number.

Twenty-seven men tested positive and were detained and sentenced for terrorism. The rest were released. Evidence later indicated that the detainees were subjected to severe beatings, as a result of which one person had to be hospitalised.\n\nThe Ljuboten police action is considered one of the most controversial episodes of the 2001 conflict, and was among the four [[ICTY]] cases arising from the conflict.\n\nThe police action in Ljuboten coincided with the security forces' counter-offensive in Radusa. It was part of the Premier's and Minister of Interior's efforts to resume the general offensive against the NLA which was stopped after 5 July 2001. However, the general offensive was not conducted because on 13 August, one day after the Ljuboten action, the ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian political official representatives in Macedonia signed the [[Ohrid Agreement|Ohrid Framework Agreement]], putting an official end to the hostilities. Although the NLA was not included in the negotiations, nor in the signing of the document, the NLA leaders agreed to disarm themselves to NATO troops.\n\n==Ohrid Framework agreement==\nThe Ohrid Framework Agreement, which was signed on 13 August 2001, put an official end to the armed conflict. The agreement set the groundwork for increasing the rights of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia. The Agreement also included provisions for altering the official languages of the country, with any language spoken by over 20% of the population becoming co-official with the [[Macedonian language]] on the municipal level. Currently only [[Albanian language|Albanian]], spoken by approximately 25% of the population, fulfils this criterion.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecmi.de/jemie/download/Focus1-2002Brunnbauer.pdf|title=The implementation of the Ohrid Agreement: Ethnic Macedonian resentments|first=Ulf|last=Brunnbauer|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|issue=1/2002|year=2002|accessdate=28 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305050053/http://www.ecmi.de/jemie/download/Focus1-2002Brunnbauer.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to the document, the version in English is the only authentic version of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement was preceded by the Ohrid discussions, a series of talks between Albanian and Macedonian representatives, along with representatives from the United States and [[European Union]]. The talks took place in [[Ohrid]] in the south-west of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. The agreement was negotiated by [[Zoran Jolevski]], Secretary General of President [[Boris Trajkovski]]. The Macedonian side was represented by the [[VMRO-DPMNE]] and the [[SDSM]], while the Albanian side was represented by the [[Democratic Party of Albanians|DPA]] and the [[Party for Democratic Prosperity|PDP]]. Although actively participating in armed conflict, the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] did not participate directly in the talks.<ref>[http://www.da.mod.uk/CSRC/documents/balkans/csrc_mpf.2004-07-22.4933876394/04(15)-Chap3-JP.pdf The Ohrid Framework Agreement Negotiations by Vasko Popetrevski and Veton Latifi] (as a [[PDF file|PDF]])</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Ceasefire and disarmament===\n[[File:Monument of the Defenders of Macedonia.JPG|thumb|Monument of the Defenders of Macedonia.]]\nAfter the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the rebels agreed to a ceasefire in June, however there were other agreements in August, before both sides settled on a final one in January 2002. Under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government pledged to improve the rights of Albanians in the country. Those rights included making Albanian the second official language, and increasing the participation of ethnic Albanians in government institutions, the police, and the army. Most importantly, under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government agreed to a new model of [[decentralization]].\n\nThe Albanian side agreed to give up any [[separatism|separatist]] demands and to fully recognize all Macedonian institutions. In addition, according to this agreement, the NLA was to disarm and hand over its weapons to [[NATO]].\n\n[[Operation Essential Harvest|Operation \"Essential Harvest\"]] was officially launched on 22 August and effectively started on 27 August. This 30-day mission involved approximately 3,500 NATO and Macedonian troops, whose objective was to disarm the NLA and to destroy their weapons. Just hours after NATO wrapped up the operation, Ali Ahmeti told reporters attending a news conference in the rebel stronghold of \u0160ipkovica, that he was dissolving the National Liberation Army and that it was time for ethnic reconciliation.\n\nSeveral months after the end of the conflict, some armed provocations persisted. Small bombings and shootings occurred. The most serious provocations happened when three Macedonian police officers were killed in an ambush by ethnic Albanian gunmen on 12 November 2001.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1650954.stm \"Macedonia police killed in ambush\"], ''[[BBC]]'', 12 November 2001</ref>\n\n===Casualties and displacement===\nCasualty figures remain uncertain.

It is also known as the NLA Museum and commemorates those who died during the conflict. Items include paramilitary clothing and insurgent flags used in 2001. Many Albanians see it as a non-military continuation of the uprising. Former NLA leader turned politician, [[Ali Ahmeti]] stated at the opening ceremony: \"My heart tells me that history is being born right here, in Skopje, the ancient city in the heart of Dardania. Our patriots have fought for it for centuries, but it is us today who have the destiny to celebrate the opening of the museum.
