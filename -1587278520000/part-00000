How well a woman follows these beauty ideals can also influence her social status within her culture. Physically altering the body has been a custom in many areas of the world for a long time. For example, decorating the body with tattoos is a symbol of attractiveness and status in the Japanese culture. The art of [[irezumi]], or covering a woman's back with tattoos, is still practiced today in Japan. In [[Burma]], [[Kayan (Burma)|Padung]] girls from the age of about five years, have metal rings put around their necks. Additional rings are added to the girl's neck every two years. This practice is done to produce a giraffe like effect in women. This practice is dying out, but these women would eventually carry up to 24 rings around their necks. A neck with many rings was considered the \"ideal\" image of physical beauty in this culture. In Europe, the corset has been used over time to create a tiny waistline. In Europe, a tiny waistline was considered \"ideal\" for beauty. A practice in China involved a girl's [[footbinding|feet being bound]] at age six to create the \"ideal\" image of feet. The girl's feet were bound to become 1/3 the original size, which crippled the woman, but also gave her a very high social status and was much admired. After the [[revolution of 1911]], this practice of foot binding was ended. The idea of what is considered the \"ideal\" of beauty for women varies across different cultural ideals and practices.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mo3shY_azw0C&pg=PA7|title=The Feminine Ideal|author=Thesander, Marianne|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=1997|isbn=978-1861890047|location=London|pages=20\u201325}}</ref>\n\nThere have been multiple \"ideals for women\" in France as well as other various cultures. A more common ideal is for females to have the \"three white things\". These \"things\" or traits refer to skin, teeth, and hands. There are also the \"three black things\" including the color of the person's eyebrows and eyelashes. This leaves three other areas to embark on color including the cheeks, lips, and nails.<ref>Gay, L. l. (2016).

How well a woman follows these beauty ideals can also influence her social status within her culture. Physically altering the body has been a custom in many areas of the world for a long time. For example, decorating the body with tattoos is a symbol of attractiveness and status in the Japanese culture. The art of [[irezumi]], or covering a woman's back with tattoos, is still practiced today in Japan. In [[Burma]], [[Kayan (Burma)|Padung]] girls from the age of about five years, have metal rings put around their necks. Additional rings are added to the girl's neck every two years. This practice is done to produce a giraffe like effect in women. This practice is dying out, but these women would eventually carry up to 24 rings around their necks. A neck with many rings was considered the \"ideal\" image of physical beauty in this culture. In Europe, the corset has been used over time to create a tiny waistline. In Europe, a tiny waistline was considered \"ideal\" for beauty. A practice in China involved a girl's [[footbinding|feet being bound]] at age six to create the \"ideal\" image of feet. The girl's feet were bound to become 1/3 the original size, which crippled the woman, but also gave her a very high social status and was much admired. After the [[revolution of 1911]], this practice of foot binding was ended. The idea of what is considered the \"ideal\" of beauty for women varies across different cultural ideals and practices.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mo3shY_azw0C&pg=PA7|title=The Feminine Ideal|author=Thesander, Marianne|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=1997|isbn=978-1861890047|location=London|pages=20\u201325}}</ref>\n\nThere have been multiple \"ideals for women\" in France as well as other various cultures. A more common ideal is for females to have the \"three white things\". These \"things\" or traits refer to skin, teeth, and hands. There are also the \"three black things\" including the color of the person's eyebrows and eyelashes. This leaves three other areas to embark on color including the cheeks, lips, and nails.<ref>Gay, L. l. (2016).

The Emperor favoured his own daughters over those of his elder brother and predecessor, Joseph I, in the succession, ignoring the decree he had signed during the reign of his father, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]].

The former, ratified in 1713, recognised Philip as King of Spain; however, the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Duchy of Milan]], the Austrian Netherlands and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] \u2013 all previously possessions of the Spanish\u2014were ceded to Austria.<ref name=Crankshaw9>Crankshaw, 9.</ref> To prevent a union of Spain and France, Philip was forced to renounce his right to succeed his grandfather's throne. Charles was extremely discontented at the loss of Spain, and as a result, he mimicked the staid [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] court ceremonial, adopting the dress of a Spanish monarch, which, according to British historian [[Edward Crankshaw]], consisted of \"a black doublet and hose, black shoes and scarlet stockings\".<ref name=Crankshaw9/>\n\nCharles's father and his advisors went about arranging a marriage for him. Their eyes fell upon [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], the eldest child of [[Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]. She was held to be strikingly beautiful by her contemporaries.<ref>Crankshaw, 10\u201311.</ref> On 1 August 1708, in Barcelona, Charles [[Proxy marriage|married her by proxy]]. She gave him two daughters that survived to adulthood, Maria Theresa and Maria Anna.\n\n===Succession to the Habsburg dominions===\nWhen Charles succeeded his brother in 1711, he was the last male Habsburg heir in the direct line. Since Habsburg possessions were subject to [[Salic law]], barring women from inheriting in their own right, his own lack of a male heir meant they would be divided on his death. The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] of 19 April 1713 abolished male-only succession in all Habsburg realms and declared their lands indivisible, although Hungary only approved it in 1723.<ref>Crankshaw, 12.</ref>\n\nCharles had three daughters, [[Maria Theresa]] (1717-1780), [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1718\u20131744)|Maria Anna]] (1718-1744) and Maria Amalia (1724-1730) but no surviving sons. When Maria Theresa was born, he disinherited his nieces and the daughters of his elder brother Joseph, [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]] and [[Maria Amalia, Holy Roman Empress|Maria Amalia]]. It was this act that undermined the chances of a smooth succession and obliged Charles to spend the rest of his reign seeking to ensure enforcement of the Sanction from other European powers.<ref>Holborn, Hajo: ''A History of Modern Germany: 1648\u20131840'' Princeton University Press 1982 {{ISBN|0-691-00796-9}}, 108.</ref>\n\nThey exacted harsh terms; in 1731, Charles agreed to a demand from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] that he close a trade competitor, the [[Ostend Company]], which was based in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and that he himself founded in 1722.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434249/Ostend-Company|title=Ostend Company|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> However, by 1735 he had secured approvals from key states, most importantly the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], which in theory bound all its members including [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]].\n\nOther signatories included Britain, [[Early Modern France|France]], the [[Dutch Republic]], Spain, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Denmark and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Savoy-Sardinia]] but subsequent events underlined [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene of Savoy]]'s comment that the best guarantee was a powerful army and full Treasury. His nieces were married to the rulers of Saxony and Bavaria, both of whom ultimately refused to be bound by the decision of the Imperial Diet and despite publicly agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735, France signed a secret treaty with Bavaria in 1738 promising to back the 'just claims' of [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Albert of Bavaria.]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=James|title=From Louis XIV to Napoleon: The Fate of a Great Power|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=185728934X|page=82}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI with his wife Empress Elisabeth Christine and their three daughters, Archduchesses (L-R) Maria Amalia, Maria Theresia and Maria Anna by Martin van Meytens.jpg|thumb|Charles VI with his wife Empress Elisabeth Christine and their daughters in 1730]]\n\nIn the first part of his reign, the empire continued to expand; success in the [[Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], adding [[Banat]] to [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and establishing direct Austrian rule over [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718-1739)|Serbia]] and [[Oltenia]] (Lesser [[Wallachia]]). This extended Austrian rule to the lower [[Danube]].<ref name=Charlesbrittanica/>\n\nThe [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] (1718-1720) followed. It too ended in an Austrian victory; by the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)]], Charles swapped Sardinia, which went to the Duke of Savoy, [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus]], for Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, which was harder to defend than Sardinia.<ref>Kahn, Robert A.: ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, California, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-520-04206-3}}, 91.</ref> The treaty also recognised [[Philip V of Spain]]'s younger son, Don Carlos (the future [[Charles III of Spain]]), as heir to the [[Duchy of Parma]] and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]; Charles had previously endorsed the succession of [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|the incumbent Grand Duke's]] daughter, [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici|Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine]].<ref>Acton, Harold: ''The Last Medici'', Macmillan, London, 1980, {{ISBN|0-333-29315-0}}, p. 256.</ref>\n\nPeace in Europe was shattered by the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733\u20131738),  a dispute over the throne of Poland between [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus of Saxony]], the previous King's elder son, and [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]]. Austria supported the former, France the latter; thus, a war broke out. By the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)]], Augustus ascended the throne, but Charles had to give the [[Kingdom of Naples]] to [[Charles III of Spain|Don Carlos]], in exchange for the much smaller [[Duchy of Parma]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/467508/War-of-the-Polish-Succession#ref=ref291264|title=War of the Polish Succession (European history)|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe issue of Charles' elder daughter's marriage was raised early in her childhood. She was first betrothed to [[L\u00e9opold Cl\u00e9ment, Hereditary Prince of Lorraine|L\u00e9opold Cl\u00e9ment of Lorraine]], who was supposed to come to Vienna and meet Maria Theresa. Instead, he died of [[smallpox]] in 1723, which upset Maria Theresa. L\u00e9opold Cl\u00e9ment's younger brother, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], then came to Vienna to replace him. Charles considered other possibilities (such as Don Carlos) before announcing the engagement to Francis.<ref>Mahan, 26.</ref> At the end of the War of the Polish Succession, France demanded that Francis surrender the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] (his hereditary domain), to [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], the deposed King of Poland, who would bequeath it to France at his death. Charles compelled Francis to renounce his rights to Lorraine and told him: \"No renunciation, no archduchess.\"<ref>Fraser, Antonia: ''Maria Antoinette: the Journey'', Orion books, London, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7538-1305-8}}, p. 7</ref> Francis complied; he was married to Maria Theresa in February 1736, and Lorraine devolved to Stanis\u0142aw in July 1737.\n\nIn 1737, the Emperor embarked on another [[Russo-Turkish War (1735\u20131739)|Turkish War]] in alliance with Russia. Unlike the previous Austro-Turkish War, it ended in a decisive Austrian defeat. Much of the territory gained in 1718 (Except for the Banat) was lost. Popular discontent at the costly war reigned in Vienna; Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, was dubbed a French spy by the Viennese.<ref>Crankshaw, 26.</ref> The war not only revealed the sorry state of the Austrian army, but also the weakness of the imperial state itself, which did not have the financial strength to sustain a long war without the subsidies of its allies.\n\n===Extermination of Romani===\nIn 1721, Charles amended his [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor#Extermination of Romani|brother's decree declaring the extermination of Romani]] ([[Gypsies]]) to include the execution of adult female Romani, while children were \"to be put in hospitals for education\".<ref name=crowe> David Crowe (2004): A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia (Palgrave Macmillan) {{ISBN|0-312-08691-1}} p.XI p.36-37</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n[[File:Kapuzinergruft Wien2.JPG|thumb|Tomb of the emperor in the [[Imperial Crypt, Vienna]]]]\n\nAt the time of Charles' death, the Habsburg lands were saturated in debt; the exchequer contained a mere 100,000 florins; and desertion was rife in Austria's sporadic army, spread across the Empire in small, ineffective barracks.<ref name=Crankshaw33>Crankshaw, 33.</ref> Contemporaries expected that Austria-Hungary would wrench itself from the Habsburg yoke upon his death.<ref name=Crankshaw33/>\n\nDespite the predicaments faced by Charles, the territorial extent of his [[Habsburg lands]] was at its greatest since the days of his [[Cognatic kinship|cognatic ancestor]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], reaching the [[Mediterranean|Southern Mediterranean]] and including the Duchy of Milan.\n\nThe Emperor, after a hunting trip across the Hungarian border in \"a typical day in the wettest and coldest October in memory\",<ref>Edward Crankshaw: ''Maria Theresa'', A&C Black, 2011.

The Emperor favoured his own daughters over those of his elder brother and predecessor, Joseph I, in the succession, ignoring the decree he had signed during the reign of his father, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]].

The former, ratified in 1713, recognised Philip as King of Spain; however, the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Duchy of Milan]], the Austrian Netherlands and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] \u2013 all previously possessions of the Spanish\u2014were ceded to Austria.<ref name=Crankshaw9>Crankshaw, 9.</ref> To prevent a union of Spain and France, Philip was forced to renounce his right to succeed his grandfather's throne. Charles was extremely discontented at the loss of Spain, and as a result, he mimicked the staid [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] court ceremonial, adopting the dress of a Spanish monarch, which, according to British historian [[Edward Crankshaw]], consisted of \"a black doublet and hose, black shoes and scarlet stockings\".<ref name=Crankshaw9/>\n\nCharles's father and his advisors went about arranging a marriage for him. Their eyes fell upon [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], the eldest child of [[Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]].

She gave him two daughters that survived to adulthood, Maria Theresa and Maria Anna.\n\n===Succession to the Habsburg dominions===\nWhen Charles succeeded his brother in 1711, he was the last male Habsburg heir in the direct line. Since Habsburg possessions were subject to [[Salic law]], barring women from inheriting in their own right, his own lack of a male heir meant they would be divided on his death. The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] of 19 April 1713 abolished male-only succession in all Habsburg realms and declared their lands indivisible, although Hungary only approved it in 1723.<ref>Crankshaw, 12.</ref>\n\nCharles had three daughters, [[Maria Theresa]] (1717-1780), [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1718\u20131744)|Maria Anna]] (1718-1744) and Maria Amalia (1724-1730) but no surviving sons. When Maria Theresa was born, he disinherited his nieces and the daughters of his elder brother Joseph, [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]] and [[Maria Amalia, Holy Roman Empress|Maria Amalia]].

It too ended in an Austrian victory; by the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)]], Charles swapped Sardinia, which went to the Duke of Savoy, [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus]], for Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, which was harder to defend than Sardinia.<ref>Kahn, Robert A.: ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, California, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-520-04206-3}}, 91.</ref> The treaty also recognised [[Philip V of Spain]]'s younger son, Don Carlos (the future [[Charles III of Spain]]), as heir to the [[Duchy of Parma]] and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]; Charles had previously endorsed the succession of [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|the incumbent Grand Duke's]] daughter, [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici|Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine]].<ref>Acton, Harold: ''The Last Medici'', Macmillan, London, 1980, {{ISBN|0-333-29315-0}}, p. 256.</ref>\n\nPeace in Europe was shattered by the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733\u20131738),  a dispute over the throne of Poland between [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus of Saxony]], the previous King's elder son, and [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]]. Austria supported the former, France the latter; thus, a war broke out.

She was first betrothed to [[L\u00e9opold Cl\u00e9ment, Hereditary Prince of Lorraine|L\u00e9opold Cl\u00e9ment of Lorraine]], who was supposed to come to Vienna and meet Maria Theresa. Instead, he died of [[smallpox]] in 1723, which upset Maria Theresa. L\u00e9opold Cl\u00e9ment's younger brother, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], then came to Vienna to replace him. Charles considered other possibilities (such as Don Carlos) before announcing the engagement to Francis.<ref>Mahan, 26.</ref> At the end of the War of the Polish Succession, France demanded that Francis surrender the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] (his hereditary domain), to [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], the deposed King of Poland, who would bequeath it to France at his death. Charles compelled Francis to renounce his rights to Lorraine and told him: \"No renunciation, no archduchess.\"<ref>Fraser, Antonia: ''Maria Antoinette: the Journey'', Orion books, London, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7538-1305-8}}, p. 7</ref> Francis complied; he was married to Maria Theresa in February 1736, and Lorraine devolved to Stanis\u0142aw in July 1737.\n\nIn 1737, the Emperor embarked on another [[Russo-Turkish War (1735\u20131739)|Turkish War]] in alliance with Russia. Unlike the previous Austro-Turkish War, it ended in a decisive Austrian defeat. Much of the territory gained in 1718 (Except for the Banat) was lost. Popular discontent at the costly war reigned in Vienna; Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, was dubbed a French spy by the Viennese.<ref>Crankshaw, 26.</ref> The war not only revealed the sorry state of the Austrian army, but also the weakness of the imperial state itself, which did not have the financial strength to sustain a long war without the subsidies of its allies.\n\n===Extermination of Romani===\nIn 1721, Charles amended his [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor#Extermination of Romani|brother's decree declaring the extermination of Romani]] ([[Gypsies]]) to include the execution of adult female Romani, while children were \"to be put in hospitals for education\".<ref name=crowe> David Crowe (2004): A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia (Palgrave Macmillan) {{ISBN|0-312-08691-1}} p.XI p.36-37</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n[[File:Kapuzinergruft Wien2.JPG|thumb|Tomb of the emperor in the [[Imperial Crypt, Vienna]]]]\n\nAt the time of Charles' death, the Habsburg lands were saturated in debt; the exchequer contained a mere 100,000 florins; and desertion was rife in Austria's sporadic army, spread across the Empire in small, ineffective barracks.<ref name=Crankshaw33>Crankshaw, 33.</ref> Contemporaries expected that Austria-Hungary would wrench itself from the Habsburg yoke upon his death.<ref name=Crankshaw33/>\n\nDespite the predicaments faced by Charles, the territorial extent of his [[Habsburg lands]] was at its greatest since the days of his [[Cognatic kinship|cognatic ancestor]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], reaching the [[Mediterranean|Southern Mediterranean]] and including the Duchy of Milan.\n\nThe Emperor, after a hunting trip across the Hungarian border in \"a typical day in the wettest and coldest October in memory\",<ref>Edward Crankshaw: ''Maria Theresa'', A&C Black, 2011.
