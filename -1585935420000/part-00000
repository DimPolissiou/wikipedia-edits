His success in battles against the [[Caliphate|Muslim states]] in the East definitively reversed the course of the centuries-long [[Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars]] and began Byzantium's 10th century \"Age of Conquest\".\n\nKourkouas belonged to a family of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent that produced several notable Byzantine generals. As commander of an imperial bodyguard regiment, Kourkouas was among the chief supporters of [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]] [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] ({{reign|920|944}}) and facilitated the latter's rise to the throne. In 923, Kourkouas was appointed commander-in-chief of the Byzantine armies along the eastern frontier, facing the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the semi-autonomous Muslim border emirates. He kept this post for more than twenty years, overseeing decisive Byzantine military successes that altered the strategic balance in the region.\n\nDuring the 9th century, Byzantium had gradually recovered its strength and internal stability while the Caliphate had become increasingly impotent and fractured. Under Kourkouas's leadership, the Byzantine armies advanced deep into Muslim territory for the first time in almost 200 years, expanding the imperial border. The emirates of [[Melitene]] and [[Erzurum|Qaliqala]] were conquered, extending Byzantine control to the upper [[Euphrates]] and over [[western Armenia]]. The remaining [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]] and Armenian princes became Byzantine vassals. Kourkouas also played a role in the defeat of a major [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] raid in 941 and recovered the ''[[Mandylion]]'' of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], an important and holy [[relic]] believed to depict the face of [[Jesus Christ]]. He was dismissed in 944 as a result of the machinations of Romanos Lekapenos's sons but restored to favour by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] ({{reign|913|959}}), serving as imperial ambassador in 946. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nJohn was a [[kinship|scion]] of the Armenian [[Kourkouas]] family&mdash;a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] form of their original surname, Gurgen (Armenian: \u0533\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0563\u0565\u0576) &mdash;which had risen to prominence in Byzantine service in the 9th century and established itself as one of the great families of the [[Anatolia]]n land-holding military aristocracy (the so-called \"''[[dynatoi]]''\").<ref>{{harvnb|ODB|loc=\"Kourkouas\" (A.

In this capacity, he arrested several high officials who opposed Lekapenos's rise to power, opening the road to the appointment of Lekapenos as regent in place of Zoe in 919.

Resenting the extension of direct Byzantine control adjacent to their own borders, the Iberians had already provided supplies to the besieged city. Once the city was invested, they vociferously demanded that the Byzantines hand over several captured towns, but when one of them, the fort of Mastaton, was surrendered, the Iberians promptly returned it to the Arabs. As Kourkouas needed to keep the Iberians placated and was aware that his conduct was being carefully observed by the Armenian princes, he did not react to this affront.<ref name=\"Runciman140\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1988|p=140}}.</ref> After seven months of siege, Theodosiopolis fell in spring 931 and was transformed into a tributary vassal, while, according to Constantine VII's ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', all territory north of the river [[Araxes]] was given to the Iberian king [[David II of Iberia|David II]]. As in Melitene, the maintenance of Byzantine control over Theodosiopolis proved difficult and the population remained restive. In 939, it revolted and drove out the Byzantines, and Theophilos Kourkouas could not finally subdue the city until 949. It was then fully incorporated into the Empire and its Muslim population was expelled and replaced by Greek and Armenian settlers.<ref name=\"Runciman140\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=322}}; {{harvnb|Holmes|2005|p=314}}.</ref>\n\n===Final capture of Melitene===\nFollowing the death of Emir [[Abu Hafs ibn Amr|Abu Hafs]], Melitene renounced its Byzantine allegiance.<ref name=\"Runciman137\"/> After attempts to take the city by storm or subterfuge failed, the Byzantines established a ring of fortresses on the hills around the plain of Melitene, and methodically ravaged the area.<ref name=\"Whittow317\"/> By early 931, the inhabitants of Melitene were forced to come to terms: they agreed to tributary status and even undertook to provide a military contingent to campaign alongside the Byzantines.<ref name=\"Whittow317\"/>\n\nThe other Muslim states were not idle, however: in March, the Byzantines were hit by three successive raids in Anatolia, organized by the Abbasid commander [[Mu'nis al-Muzaffar]], while in August, a large raid led by Thamal of Tarsus penetrated as far as [[Ancyra]] and [[Amorium]] and returned with prisoners worth 136,000&nbsp;[[gold dinar]]s.<ref name=\"Runciman141\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1988|p=141}}.</ref> During this time, the Byzantines were engaged in southern Armenia, aiding the ruler of [[Vaspurakan Kingdom|Vaspurakan]], [[Gagik I of Vaspurakan|Gagik I]], who had rallied the local Armenian princes and allied himself with the Byzantines against the emir of Adharbayjan. There they raided the Kaysite emirate and razed Khliat and [[Berkri]] to the ground, before marching into Mesopotamia and capturing Samosata again.

The Byzantine army and navy were absent from the capital, and the appearance of the Rus' fleet caused panic among the populace of Constantinople. While the navy and Kourkouas's army were recalled, a hastily assembled squadron of old ships armed with [[Greek Fire]] and placed under the ''[[protovestiarios]]'' [[Theophanes (chamberlain)|Theophanes]] defeated the Rus' fleet on June 11, forcing it to abandon its course toward the city.

His success in battles against the [[Caliphate|Muslim states]] in the East definitively reversed the course of the centuries-long [[Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars]] and began Byzantium's 10th century \"Age of Conquest\".\n\nKourkouas belonged to a family of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent that produced several notable Byzantine generals. As commander of an imperial bodyguard regiment, Kourkouas was among the chief supporters of [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]] [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] ({{reign|920|944}}) and facilitated the latter's rise to the throne. In 923, Kourkouas was appointed commander-in-chief of the Byzantine armies along the eastern frontier, facing the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the semi-autonomous Muslim border emirates. He kept this post for more than twenty years, overseeing decisive Byzantine military successes that altered the strategic balance in the region.\n\nDuring the 9th century, Byzantium had gradually recovered its strength and internal stability while the Caliphate had become increasingly impotent and fractured. Under Kourkouas's leadership, the Byzantine armies advanced deep into Muslim territory for the first time in almost 200 years, expanding the imperial border. The emirates of [[Melitene]] and [[Erzurum|Qaliqala]] were conquered, extending Byzantine control to the upper [[Euphrates]] and over [[western Armenia]]. The remaining [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]] and Armenian princes became Byzantine vassals. Kourkouas also played a role in the defeat of a major [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] raid in 941 and recovered the ''[[Mandylion]]'' of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], an important and holy [[relic]] believed to depict the face of [[Jesus Christ]]. He was dismissed in 944 as a result of the machinations of Romanos Lekapenos's sons but restored to favour by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] ({{reign|913|959}}), serving as imperial ambassador in 946. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nJohn was a [[kinship|scion]] of the Armenian [[Kourkouas]] family&mdash;a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] form of their original surname, Gurgen (Armenian: \u0533\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0563\u0565\u0576) &mdash;which had risen to prominence in Byzantine service in the 9th century and established itself as one of the great families of the [[Anatolia]]n land-holding military aristocracy (the so-called \"''[[dynatoi]]''\").<ref>{{harvnb|ODB|loc=\"Kourkouas\" (A.

In this capacity, he arrested several high officials who opposed Lekapenos's rise to power, opening the road to the appointment of Lekapenos as regent in place of Zoe in 919.

Once the city was invested, they vociferously demanded that the Byzantines hand over several captured towns, but when one of them, the fort of Mastaton, was surrendered, the Iberians promptly returned it to the Arabs.

As in Melitene, the maintenance of Byzantine control over Theodosiopolis proved difficult and the population remained restive. In 939, it revolted and drove out the Byzantines, and Theophilos Kourkouas could not finally subdue the city until 949.

Wary of the city's previous rebellions, Kourkouas only allowed those inhabitants to remain who were Christians or agreed to convert to Christianity.

They were led by al-Hasan, called ''[[Nasir al-Dawla]]'' (\"Defender of the State\"), and by his younger brother Ali, best known by his [[laqab|epithet]], ''[[Sayf al-Dawla]]'' (\"Sword of the State\").<ref name=\"Whittow318\"/> In {{circa|935}}, the Arab tribe of [[Banu Habib]], defeated by the rising Hamdanids, defected in its entirety to the Byzantines, converted to Christianity, and placed its 12,000&nbsp;horsemen at the disposal of the Empire. They were settled along the western bank of the Euphrates and assigned to guard five new [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]] created there: Melitene, [[Charpezikion]], Asmosaton ([[Arsamosata]]), [[Derzene]], and [[Chozanon]].<ref name=\"Treadgold483\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Treadgold|1998|p=78}}.</ref>\n\nThe first Byzantine encounter with Sayf al-Dawla took place in 936, when he tried to relieve Samosata, but a revolt at home forced him to turn back.<ref name=\"Treadgold483\"/> In another invasion in 938, however, he captured the fort of [[Charpete]] and defeated Kourkouas's advance guard, seizing a great amount of booty and forcing Kourkouas to withdraw.<ref name=\"Treadgold483\"/><ref>{{harvnb|ODB|loc=\"Sayf al-Dawla\" (A.

In early summer 941, as Kourkouas prepared to resume campaigning in the East, his attention was diverted by an unexpected event: the appearance of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] fleet that raided the area around Constantinople itself. The Byzantine army and navy were absent from the capital, and the appearance of the Rus' fleet caused panic among the populace of Constantinople. While the navy and Kourkouas's army were recalled, a hastily assembled squadron of old ships armed with [[Greek Fire]] and placed under the ''[[protovestiarios]]'' [[Theophanes (chamberlain)|Theophanes]] defeated the Rus' fleet on June 11, forcing it to abandon its course toward the city. The surviving Rus' landed on the shores of [[Bithynia]] and ravaged the defenseless countryside.<ref>{{harvnb|Jenkins|1987|pp=250\u2013251}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1988|pp=111\u2013112}}.</ref> The ''patrikios'' [[Bardas Phokas the Elder|Bardas Phokas]] hastened to the area with whatever troops he could gather, contained the raiders, and awaited the arrival of Kourkouas's army. Finally, Kourkouas and his army appeared and fell upon the Rus', who had dispersed to plunder the countryside, killing many of them. The survivors retreated to their ships and tried to cross  to [[Thrace]] under the cover of night.

To the Byzantines, especially after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm period]] and the restoration of image veneration, it was a relic of profound religious significance. As a result, its capture would provide the Lekapenos regime with an enormous boost in popularity and legitimacy.<ref name=\"Whittow321\"/><ref name=\"Guilland572\">{{harvnb|Guilland|1967|p=572}}.</ref>\n\nKourkouas assailed Edessa every year from 942 onward and devastated its countryside, as he had done at Melitene.

The two eldest surviving sons of Romanos I, co-emperors [[Stephen Lekapenos|Stephen]] and [[Constantine Lekapenos|Constantine]], were jealous of Kourkouas and had in the past tried to undermine him, albeit without success.<ref name=\"Runciman146\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1988|p=146}}.</ref> Following the success of Kourkouas in the East, Romanos I considered marrying his trusted general into the imperial family. Kourkouas's daughter Euphrosyne was to be wedded with the emperor's grandson, the future [[Romanos II]] ({{reign|959|963}}), the son of his son-in-law and junior emperor Constantine VII. Although such a union would effectively cement the loyalty of the army, it would also strengthen the position of the legitimate [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian line]], represented by Constantine VII, over the imperial claims of Romanos's own sons.<ref name=\"Guilland572\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=484\u2013485}}; {{harvnb|Holmes|2005|pp=131\u2013132}}.</ref> Predictably, Stephen and Constantine opposed this decision and prevailed upon their father, who was by this time old and ill, to dismiss Kourkouas in the autumn of 944.<ref name=\"Runciman146\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=485}}.</ref>\n\nKourkouas was replaced by a certain [[Pantherios]], who was almost immediately defeated by Sayf al-Dawla in December while raiding near Aleppo. On 16 December, Romanos I himself was deposed by Stephen and Constantine and banished to a monastery on the island of [[Prote]]. A few weeks later, on 26 January, another coup removed the two young Lekapenoi from power and restored the sole imperial authority to Constantine VII.<ref name=\"Whittow321\"/><ref name=\"Runciman146\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=486}}.</ref> Kourkouas himself appears to have soon returned to imperial favour: Constantine provided the money for the repair of Kourkouas's palace after it was damaged by an earthquake, and in early 946, he is recorded as having been sent with the ''[[magistros]]'' Kosmas to negotiate a [[Arab\u2013Byzantine prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] with the Arabs of Tarsus. Nothing further is known about him.<ref>{{harvnb|Guilland|1967|pp=442, 572}}.</ref> \n\nThe fall of the Lekapenoi signalled the end of an era in terms of personalities, but Kourkouas's expansionist policy continued: he was succeeded as Domestic of the Schools by [[Bardas Phokas the Elder]], followed by [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]], who reigned as emperor in 963\u2013969, and finally, by Kourkouas's own great-nephew, [[John Tzimiskes]], who reigned as emperor in 969\u2013976.

Ashot later arranged a marriage between his daughter, Sophie, and Grigor-Derenik, in order to reconcile.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=375}} Ashot also strengthened relations with the [[Siunia Dynasty]] by arranging another marriage between his second daughter, Mariam, with Prince Vasak Gabur IV.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=272}} These familial ties helped strengthen relations between Ashot's sons and the surrounding dynasties.\n\nAshot used this support to wage war against the emirs. He began by defeating the [[Kaysites]] of [[Manazkert]] in 863,{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=376}} with the help of his brother and [[sparapet]], Abas Bagratuni.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} In 877, he began to fight against the emir of [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] alongside his [[ostikan]]; however, failure of this ostikan led to his replacement.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=385}} The new ostikan made a secret peace treaty with the emir and betrayed Ashot. Ashot learned of the conspiracy against him and sent Abas to disarm the ostikan in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]; Abas escorted him to the border under Ashot's orders in order to prevent the Caliph's retaliation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=386}} Ashot defeated the emirs of Barda and Manazkert, laying siege to the latter city in 884; however, the siege was ceased prematurely. The siege caused Grigor-Derenik to worry about the borders of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], which was under Grigor-Derenik's control.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=387}} Ashot gained control of the [[Gugark]] and [[Utik]] regions{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=391}} as early as 860.{{sfn|Dorfman-Lazarev|2004|p=65}}\n\nAshot's reach also extended to [[Principality of Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]], where some of his Bargatuni family had settled in the late 7th century. There, around 875, he formed an alliance with [[Bagrat I of Iberia]], his step-brother, against Bagrat's brother, [[Guaram Mampali]].{{sfn|Toumanoff|1990|pp=121, 129}} Together, Ashot and Bagrat defeated Guaram. In 881, Ashot formed an alliance with [[David I of Iberia]] and [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]], Bagrat's son and grandson, respectively, to defeat Guaram's son, [[Nasra of Tao-Klarjeti]].{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=392}}\n\n===King of Armenia===\n[[File:Caucasus, 884-962.gif|thumb|300px|The borders of Bagratid Armenia from 884 to 962.]]\nSeveral contemporary prominent Armenians, including Grigor-Derenik Vaspurakan, insisted on Ashot's coronation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=394}} Ashot was crowned [[King of Armenia]] through the consent of Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] in 885 to prevent intrusion into Armenian territory by [[Basil I]], a [[Byzantine emperor]] of Armenian origin.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=244}} As a result of his coronation, Ashot restored the Armenian monarchy and became the founder of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Kingdom of Armenia]], also known as [[Bagratid Armenia]], named after the contemporary rule of the Bagratunis. The Bagratid kingdom lasted until 1045, when it was annexed into the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Cheynet|2006|p=41}}\n\nDespite his status, Ashot remained a subordinate to the Caliph and was put under the supervision of the emirs of Azerbaijan.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} Every Armenian prince fell under Ashot's authority (though in the effect of [[primus inter pares]]{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=239}}). Dvin and the emirates of Manazkert and [[Erzurum|Karin]] (and, according to [[Constantine VII]], [[Khoy]] and [[Salmas]]){{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}} also fell under Ashot's control, despite the local governments' unwillingness to accept.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} The emir of Manazkert was in this way defeated and was forced to submit to Ashot's rule in 885.{{sfn|Thierry|2007|pp=291-292}}\n\nAshot's influence continued not only in Armenia but also in Iberia. After the death on Grigor-Derenik Artsruni in 887, Ashot placed his own grandson (and Grigor-Derenik's son), Ashot-Sargis Artsruni, under the rule of relative Gagik Aboumerwan Artsruni.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=389}} In 887 and 888, Ashot supported his nephew [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]] in overthrowing [[Bagrat I of Abkhazia]].{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}} Also in 888, Ashot sent his brother Abas to [[Kars]] to stop a rebellion led by Prince Sahak-Mleh of [[Vanand]].{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}}\n\nAshot travelled to [[Gugark]] to stop another rebellion, fighting alongside his son and heir, [[Smbat I of Armenia|Smbat I]]. He died in 890. Contemporary historian [[Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi]] gives an account of his death:\n\n{{quotation|Since he died on the road, in an inn at a rocky place called K'arsparn, they carried away his body in a coffin and brought it to the town (awan) of Bagaran, the royal residence, where they covered the coffin with robes and veils interwoven and adorned with gold; and carefully selected detachments of military forces clad in arms and ornaments stood guard. The great katholikos, accompanied by the rest of the clerics of the church, also came forth and solemnly chanted psalms and raised the voice of [their] praise. His three sons, the senior [gaherec'] princes of the royal house and other friends followed the coffin, and thus they arrived at the cemetery....Then, building a tomb [suitable] for royalty, they buried him in the cemetery of his ancestors.{{sfn|Manuk-Khaloyan|2013|p=134}}}}\n\nSmbat I succeeded him.\n\n==Armenian growth under rule==\nAshot's restoration of the Armenian monarchy was accompanied by economic growth{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=239}} and a revival of the arts and religion.{{sfn|Redgate|2000|p=196}} Several cultural buildings were restored and renovated. Under Ashot's reign, the first [[khachkar]] was created in 879 as a tribute to Ashot's wife, Katranide.{{sfn|Donab\u00e9dian|Thierry|1987|p=530}} Urban growth began to occur{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=396}} and agriculture flourished.

In 862, when the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios I]] attempted to unite the Armenian Church by sending two letters to Catholicos [[Zacharias I of Armenia|Zacharias I]] and Ashot, Zacharias and Ashot summoned a council in Yerazgavors;{{sfn|Grousset|2007|p=383}} the ambiguous response{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2004|p=147}} was formulated by Ashot.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}} Ashot continued to receive epistolary communication; in 882, he received a letter with a [[True Cross]] awarded to Catholicos [[Mashdotz I|Mashtots I]], who was a friend of Ashot (the cross has since been lost).{{sfn|Dorfman-Lazarev|2004|p=85}} Ashot also supported the Armenian Church's desire to separate from the [[Church of Caucasian Albania]].{{sfn| Garso\u00efan|2007|p=244}} Ashot donated several treasures to the Armenian Catholicos to distribute to the churches.{{sfn|Durand|2007|p=198}}\n\n==Family==\n{{main|Bagratuni family tree}}\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | PR0|y|PR1 | | PR1 = [[Katranide I]] <br /> [[List of Armenian consorts|Queen of Armenia]]<br />(885-890)| PR0= Ashot the Great<br />[[Prince of Princes]], [[sparapet]]<br /> (855-885)<br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(885-890)}}\n{{chart| | |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{chart| |PR1 | | |!| | | PR2| | |!| | |PR3| | |!| | |PR4| PR1= [[Smbat I of Armenia|Smbat]]<br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(890-914)| PR2 = Sahak |PR3= David <br />(\u2020902)|PR4=[[Shapuh sparapet|Shapuh]]<br />[[sparapet]]<br />(\u2020912)}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | |!}}\n{{chart| |!| | |PR1 |y| PR2| |PR3|y|PR4| |PR5 |y|PR6|!| | |PR1= [[Sofya Bagratuni|Sofya]] |PR2 = [[Grigor-Derenik Artsruni|Grigor-Derenik]]<br />prince of [[Vaspurakan]]<br />(857-887)|PR3= daughter|PR4=Vahan Artsruni|PR5= [[Mariam Bagratuni|Mariam]]<br />(\u2020914)|PR6= [[Vasak Syuni]]<br />prince of [[Principality of Syunik|Syunik]]<br />(855-859)}}\n{{chart| |!| |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|-|.|!| }}\n{{chart| |!|PR0| |PR1 | |PR2| | |!|PR4| |PR5| | PR6|!| | | | PR0= [[Ashot-Sargis of Vaspurakan|Ashot]]<br />prince of [[Vaspurakan]]<br />(898-904)| PR2= [[Gurgen II Artsruni|Gurgen]] <br />prince of [[Parskahayk]]<br />(904-925)| PR1= [[Gagik I of Vaspurakan|Gagik]]<br />prince and [[Vaspurakan Kingdom|king]] of [[Vaspurakan]]<br />(904-908) / (908-943)| PR4=[[Grigor-Supan II|Grigor]]<br />prince of [[Principality of Syunik|Syunik]]<br />(855-859)<br />(859-913)| PR5= Sahak| PR6= Vasak}}\n{{chart| |`|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| | | |`|-|-|.| | | | | |,|-|-|(}}\n{{chart| | |PR1|~|PR2| |PR3|~|GRG| |PR4|~|PR5 | |PR6| | | |PR1=  [[Ashot II of Armenia|Ashot the Iron]] <br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(914-928)|PR2 = [[Sahakanuysh Sevada]]|PR3= [[Abas I of Armenia|Abas]]<br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(928-953)|PR4= Seda |PR5= son |PR6= [[Ashot sparapet|Ashot]]|GRG=[[Gurgendukht Bagratuni]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| ref=harv |author =Federal Research Division| authorlink= Federal Research Division | year =2004| title=Armenia: A Country Study| chapter =| editor =| edition =| pages =| publisher =Kessinger Publishing| isbn =1-4191-0751-8| url =}}\n* {{cite book |last=Cheynet |first=Jean-Claude |year=2006 |chapter=L\u2019expansion byzantine durant la dynastie mac\u00e9donienne (867-1057) |trans-chapter=Byzantine Expansion During the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1057) |title=Le monde byzantin : L'Empire byzantin (641-1204) |volume=4 |trans-title=The Byzantine World: The Byzantine Empire (641-1204) |series=Nouvelle Clio \u2014 L\u2019histoire et ses probl\u00e8mes |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher= |isbn=978-2-13-052007-8 |pages=23\u201342}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Cowe |first=S.

In 862, Ashot was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by Abbasid Caliph [[al-Musta'in]], who saw this as a measure of protection against the local autonomous [[emir]]s.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}}{{sfn|Cowe|2000|p=78}} This title essentially granted Ashot the status of ''de facto'' king{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2004|p=147}} and placed him at a similar level of power as the emirs,{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}} but did not allow Ashot to have administrative rule over the kingdom.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=373}} Ashot kept this status during the reigns of Abbasid Caliphs [[al-Mu'tazz]] (866\u2013869), [[al-Muhtadi]] (869\u2013870) and [[al-Mu'tamid]] (870\u2013892).\n\nAshot annexed [[Bagrevand]] in 862, shortly after the death of the ruling [[Mamikonian|Mamikonian Dynasty's]] head, Grigor Mamikonian.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} Ashot mediated between Grigor-Derenik Artsruni and Gurgen Artsruni, cousins and members of the Artsruni family who controlled [[Vaspurakan]].{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} Ashot then captured Grigor-Derenik{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=374}} and reduced the size of the cantons around [[Van, Turkey|Van]].{{sfn|Thierry|2007|p=275}} Ashot released Grigor-Derenik to avoid further conflict with the Artsruni family. Ashot later arranged a marriage between his daughter, Sophie, and Grigor-Derenik, in order to reconcile.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=375}} Ashot also strengthened relations with the [[Siunia Dynasty]] by arranging another marriage between his second daughter, Mariam, with Prince Vasak Gabur IV.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=272}} These familial ties helped strengthen relations between Ashot's sons and the surrounding dynasties.\n\nAshot used this support to wage war against the emirs. He began by defeating the [[Kaysites]] of [[Manazkert]] in 863,{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=376}} with the help of his brother and [[sparapet]], Abas Bagratuni.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} In 877, he began to fight against the emir of [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] alongside his [[ostikan]]; however, failure of this ostikan led to his replacement.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=385}} The new ostikan made a secret peace treaty with the emir and betrayed Ashot. Ashot learned of the conspiracy against him and sent Abas to disarm the ostikan in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]; Abas escorted him to the border under Ashot's orders in order to prevent the Caliph's retaliation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=386}} Ashot defeated the emirs of Barda and Manazkert, laying siege to the latter city in 884; however, the siege was ceased prematurely. The siege caused Grigor-Derenik to worry about the borders of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], which was under Grigor-Derenik's control.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=387}} Ashot gained control of the [[Gugark]] and [[Utik]] regions{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=391}} as early as 860.{{sfn|Dorfman-Lazarev|2004|p=65}}\n\nAshot's reach also extended to [[Principality of Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]], where some of his Bargatuni family had settled in the late 7th century. There, around 875, he formed an alliance with [[Bagrat I of Iberia]], his step-brother, against Bagrat's brother, [[Guaram Mampali]].{{sfn|Toumanoff|1990|pp=121, 129}} Together, Ashot and Bagrat defeated Guaram. In 881, Ashot formed an alliance with [[David I of Iberia]] and [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]], Bagrat's son and grandson, respectively, to defeat Guaram's son, [[Nasra of Tao-Klarjeti]].{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=392}}\n\n===King of Armenia===\n[[File:EarlyBagratid884-962.gif|thumb|300px|The borders of Bagratid Armenia from 884 to 962.]]\nSeveral contemporary prominent Armenians, including Grigor-Derenik Vaspurakan, insisted on Ashot's coronation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=394}} Ashot was crowned [[King of Armenia]] through the consent of Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] in 885 to prevent intrusion into Armenian territory by [[Basil I]], a [[Byzantine emperor]] of Armenian origin.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=244}} As a result of his coronation, Ashot restored the Armenian monarchy and became the founder of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Kingdom of Armenia]], also known as [[Bagratid Armenia]], named after the contemporary rule of the Bagratunis. The Bagratid kingdom lasted until 1045, when it was annexed into the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Cheynet|2006|p=41}}\n\nDespite his status, Ashot remained a subordinate to the Caliph and was put under the supervision of the emirs of Azerbaijan.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} Every Armenian prince fell under Ashot's authority (though in the effect of [[primus inter pares]]{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=239}}). Dvin and the emirates of Manazkert and [[Erzurum|Karin]] (and, according to [[Constantine VII]], [[Khoy]] and [[Salmas]]){{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}} also fell under Ashot's control, despite the local governments' unwillingness to accept.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} The emir of Manazkert was in this way defeated and was forced to submit to Ashot's rule in 885.{{sfn|Thierry|2007|pp=291-292}}\n\nAshot's influence continued not only in Armenia but also in Iberia. After the death on Grigor-Derenik Artsruni in 887, Ashot placed his own grandson (and Grigor-Derenik's son), Ashot-Sargis Artsruni, under the rule of relative Gagik Aboumerwan Artsruni.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=389}} In 887 and 888, Ashot supported his nephew [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]] in overthrowing [[Bagrat I of Abkhazia]].{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}} Also in 888, Ashot sent his brother Abas to [[Kars]] to stop a rebellion led by Prince Sahak-Mleh of [[Vanand]].{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}}\n\nAshot travelled to [[Gugark]] to stop another rebellion, fighting alongside his son and heir, [[Smbat I of Armenia|Smbat I]]. He died in 890. Contemporary historian [[Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi]] gives an account of his death:\n\n{{quotation|Since he died on the road, in an inn at a rocky place called K'arsparn, they carried away his body in a coffin and brought it to the town (awan) of Bagaran, the royal residence, where they covered the coffin with robes and veils interwoven and adorned with gold; and carefully selected detachments of military forces clad in arms and ornaments stood guard. The great katholikos, accompanied by the rest of the clerics of the church, also came forth and solemnly chanted psalms and raised the voice of [their] praise. His three sons, the senior [gaherec'] princes of the royal house and other friends followed the coffin, and thus they arrived at the cemetery....Then, building a tomb [suitable] for royalty, they buried him in the cemetery of his ancestors.{{sfn|Manuk-Khaloyan|2013|p=134}}}}\n\nSmbat I succeeded him.\n\n==Armenian growth under rule==\nAshot's restoration of the Armenian monarchy was accompanied by economic growth{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=239}} and a revival of the arts and religion.{{sfn|Redgate|2000|p=196}} Several cultural buildings were restored and renovated. Under Ashot's reign, the first [[khachkar]] was created in 879 as a tribute to Ashot's wife, Katranide.{{sfn|Donab\u00e9dian|Thierry|1987|p=530}} Urban growth began to occur{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=396}} and agriculture flourished.

In 862, when the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios I]] attempted to unite the Armenian Church by sending two letters to Catholicos [[Zacharias I of Armenia|Zacharias I]] and Ashot, Zacharias and Ashot summoned a council in Yerazgavors;{{sfn|Grousset|2007|p=383}} the ambiguous response{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2004|p=147}} was formulated by Ashot.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}} Ashot continued to receive epistolary communication; in 882, he received a letter with a [[True Cross]] awarded to Catholicos [[Mashdotz I|Mashtots I]], who was a friend of Ashot (the cross has since been lost).{{sfn|Dorfman-Lazarev|2004|p=85}} Ashot also supported the Armenian Church's desire to separate from the [[Church of Caucasian Albania]].{{sfn| Garso\u00efan|2007|p=244}} Ashot donated several treasures to the Armenian Catholicos to distribute to the churches.{{sfn|Durand|2007|p=198}}\n\n==Family==\n{{main|Bagratuni family tree}}\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | PR0|y|PR1 | | PR1 = [[Katranide I]] <br /> [[List of Armenian consorts|Queen of Armenia]]<br />(885-890)| PR0= Ashot the Great<br />[[Prince of Princes]], [[sparapet]]<br /> (855-885)<br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(885-890)}}\n{{chart| | |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{chart| |PR1 | | |!| | | PR2| | |!| | |PR3| | |!| | |PR4| PR1= [[Smbat I of Armenia|Smbat]]<br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(890-914)| PR2 = Sahak |PR3= David <br />(\u2020902)|PR4=[[Shapuh sparapet|Shapuh]]<br />[[sparapet]]<br />(\u2020912)}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | |!}}\n{{chart| |!| | |PR1 |y| PR2| |PR3|y|PR4| |PR5 |y|PR6|!| | |PR1= [[Sofya Bagratuni|Sofya]] |PR2 = [[Grigor-Derenik Artsruni|Grigor-Derenik]]<br />prince of [[Vaspurakan]]<br />(857-887)|PR3= daughter|PR4=Vahan Artsruni|PR5= [[Mariam Bagratuni|Mariam]]<br />(\u2020914)|PR6= [[Vasak Syuni]]<br />prince of [[Principality of Syunik|Syunik]]<br />(855-859)}}\n{{chart| |!| |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|-|.|!| }}\n{{chart| |!|PR0| |PR1 | |PR2| | |!|PR4| |PR5| | PR6|!| | | | PR0= [[Ashot-Sargis of Vaspurakan|Ashot]]<br />prince of [[Vaspurakan]]<br />(898-904)| PR2= [[Gurgen II Artsruni|Gurgen]] <br />prince of [[Parskahayk]]<br />(904-925)| PR1= [[Gagik I of Vaspurakan|Gagik]]<br />prince and [[Vaspurakan Kingdom|king]] of [[Vaspurakan]]<br />(904-908) / (908-943)| PR4=[[Grigor-Supan II|Grigor]]<br />prince of [[Principality of Syunik|Syunik]]<br />(855-859)<br />(859-913)| PR5= Sahak| PR6= Vasak}}\n{{chart| |`|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| | | |`|-|-|.| | | | | |,|-|-|(}}\n{{chart| | |PR1|~|PR2| |PR3|~|GRG| |PR4|~|PR5 | |PR6| | | |PR1=  [[Ashot II of Armenia|Ashot the Iron]] <br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(914-928)|PR2 = [[Sahakanuysh Sevada]]|PR3= [[Abas I of Armenia|Abas]]<br />[[Kingdom of Armenia (Bagratid)|king of Armenia]]<br />(928-953)|PR4= Seda |PR5= son |PR6= [[Ashot sparapet|Ashot]]|GRG=[[Gurgendukht Bagratuni]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| ref=harv |author =Federal Research Division| authorlink= Federal Research Division | year =2004| title=Armenia: A Country Study| chapter =| editor =| edition =| pages =| publisher =Kessinger Publishing| isbn =1-4191-0751-8| url =}}\n* {{cite book |last=Cheynet |first=Jean-Claude |year=2006 |chapter=L\u2019expansion byzantine durant la dynastie mac\u00e9donienne (867-1057) |trans-chapter=Byzantine Expansion During the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1057) |title=Le monde byzantin : L'Empire byzantin (641-1204) |volume=4 |trans-title=The Byzantine World: The Byzantine Empire (641-1204) |series=Nouvelle Clio \u2014 L\u2019histoire et ses probl\u00e8mes |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher= |isbn=978-2-13-052007-8 |pages=23\u201342}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Cowe |first=S.

Sutton then received an economics professorship at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and a research fellowship at [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]] from 1968 to 1973. During his time at the Hoover Institution, he wrote the major study ''Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development'' (in three volumes), arguing that the West played a major role in developing the Soviet Union from its very beginnings up until the then-present year of 1970. Sutton argued that the [[Soviet Union]]'s technological and manufacturing base, which was then engaged in supplying the [[Viet Cong]], was built by United States corporations and largely funded by US taxpayers. Steel and iron plants, the [[GAZ]] automobile factory, a [[Ford]] subsidiary in eastern Russia, and many other Soviet industrial enterprises were built with the help or technical assistance of the United States or US corporations. He argued further that the Soviet Union's acquisition of [[MIRV]] technology was made possible by receiving (from US sources) machining equipment for the manufacture of precision [[ball bearings]], necessary to mass-produce MIRV-enabled missiles. He has contributed articles to Human Events, The Review of the News, Triumph, Ordnance, and many other journals.\n \nIn 1973, Sutton published a popularized, condensed version of the sections of the forthcoming third volume relevant to military technology called ''National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union'' after which he was forced out of the Hoover Institution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Millegan (ed.)|first1=Kris|title=Fleshing Out Skull and Bones|date=2004|publisher=Trine Day|location=Walterville, OR|isbn=0-9752906-0-6|page=89}}</ref> His conclusion from his research on the issue was that the conflicts of the Cold War were \"not fought to restrain communism\" but were organised in order \"to generate multibillion-dollar armaments contracts\", since the United States, through financing the Soviet Union \"directly or indirectly armed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam\" \"<ref name=wh12>Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, Chapter 12</ref>\n\nThe update to the text, ''The Best Enemy Money Can Buy'', looked at the role of military technology transfers up to the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3vZNSAi-QM|title=The Best Enemies Money Can Buy|work=Interview with Prof. Antony C.

Sutton then received an economics professorship at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and a research fellowship at [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]] from 1968 to 1973. During his time at the Hoover Institution, he wrote the major study ''Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development'' (in three volumes), arguing that the West played a major role in developing the Soviet Union from its very beginnings up until the then-present year of 1970. Sutton argued that the [[Soviet Union]]'s technological and manufacturing base, which was then engaged in supplying the [[Viet Cong]], was built by United States corporations and largely funded by US taxpayers. Steel and iron plants, the [[GAZ]] automobile factory, a [[Ford]] subsidiary in eastern Russia, and many other Soviet industrial enterprises were built with the help or technical assistance of the United States or US corporations. He argued further that the Soviet Union's acquisition of [[MIRV]] technology was made possible by receiving (from US sources) machining equipment for the manufacture of precision [[ball bearings]], necessary to mass-produce MIRV-enabled missiles. He has contributed articles to Human Events, The Review of the News, Triumph, Ordnance, and many other journals.\n \nIn 1973, Sutton published a popularized, condensed version of the sections of the forthcoming third volume relevant to military technology called ''National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union'' after which he was forced out of the Hoover Institution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Millegan (ed.)|first1=Kris|title=Fleshing Out Skull and Bones|date=2004|publisher=Trine Day|location=Walterville, OR|isbn=0-9752906-0-6|page=89}}</ref> His conclusion from his research on the issue was that the conflicts of the Cold War were \"not fought to restrain communism\" but were organised in order \"to generate multibillion-dollar armaments contracts\", since the United States, through financing the Soviet Union \"directly or indirectly armed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam\" \"<ref name=wh12>Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, Chapter 12</ref>\n\nThe update to the text, ''The Best Enemy Money Can Buy'', looked at the role of military technology transfers up to the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3vZNSAi-QM|title=The Best Enemies Money Can Buy|work=Interview with Prof. Antony C.

When ''The War on Gold'' was released the following year in 1977, the dust jacket description announced the follow-up book, ''The Paper Factory'', would be published in 1978, but this book was never released.\n\nArchive footage of Sutton was used in the 2014 documentary, ''JFK to 9/11: Everything Is a Rich Man's Trick''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Full Cast & Crew |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4798606/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm |website=IMDb |accessdate=3 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe Hoover Institution Archives house four boxes of Sutton\u2019s personal papers from 1920 to 1972.

He was born into affluence, which ended with the death of his grandfather. In 1913, he wrote a critical letter to a [[pulp magazine]] that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. During the [[interwar period]], he wrote and published stories that focused on his interpretation of humanity's place in the universe. In his view, humanity was an unimportant part of an uncaring cosmos that could be swept away at any moment. These stories also included [[fantastic]] elements that represented the perceived fragility of [[anthropocentrism]].\n\nLovecraft was at the center of a wider body of authors known as \"The Lovecraft Circle.\" This group wrote stories that frequently shared details between them. He was also a prolific writer of letters. He maintained a correspondence with several different authors and literary proteges. According to some estimates, he wrote approximately 100,000 letters over the course of his lifetime.{{refn|This is according to L. Sprague de Camp and S. T.

He was virtually unknown during his lifetime and was almost exclusively published in [[pulp magazine]]s before he died in poverty at the age of 46, but is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors of supernatural horror fiction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schweitzer |first=Darrell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dX30AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=The%20verdict%20is%20now%20in:%20Lovecraft%20is%20the%20most%20important%20writer%20of%20supernatural%20horror%20fiction%20in%20English%20since%20Poe.&f=false |title=Discovering H.

The exact sources of Phillips' weird tales have not been identified.  Lovecraft himself guessed that they originated from classic [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novelists]] like [[Ann Radcliffe]], [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], and [[Charles Maturin]]. On March 27, 1904, he was seized by a \u201cparalytic shock,\u201d (likely a stroke). He died the following day, at his home at 454 Angell Street.<ref>{{Cite book |last=de Camp |first=L.

When home, Whipple would share weird tales of his own invention and show Lovecraft objects of art he had acquired in his European travels.

Specifically, he began to have recurring nightmares of beings he termed \"night-gaunts\"; their appearance he credited to the influence of Dor\u00e9's illustrations, which would \"whirl me through space at a sickening rate of speed, the while fretting & impelling me with their detestable tridents.\" Thirty years later, night gaunts would appear in Lovecraft's writing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|34}}\n\nLovecraft's earliest known literary works began at age seven with poems restyling the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and other mythological stories.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|38}} Lovecraft has said that as a child he was enamored of the Roman pantheon of gods, accepting them as genuine expressions of divinity and foregoing his Christian upbringing. He recalled, at five years old, being told Santa Claus did not exist and retorting by asking why \"God is not equally a myth.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|42}} At the age of eight, he took a keen interest in the sciences, particularly astronomy and chemistry. He also examined the anatomy books available to him in the family library, learning the specifics of human reproduction that had yet to be explained to him, and found that it \"virtually killed my interest in the subject.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|60}} In 1902, according to Lovecraft's own correspondence, astronomy became a guiding influence on his world view. He began producing the periodical ''Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy'', of which 69 issues survive, using the [[hectograph]] printing method.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|84}} Lovecraft went in and out of elementary school repeatedly, oftentimes with home tutors making up for those lost school years, missing time due to health concerns that are not entirely clear. The written recollections of his peers described him as both withdrawn yet openly welcoming to anyone who shared his current fascination with astronomy, inviting anyone to look through the telescope he prized.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|90}}\n\nBy 1900, Whipple's various business concerns were suffering a downturn and slowly reducing his family's wealth. He was forced to let the family's hired servants go, leaving Lovecraft, Whipple, and Susie, being the only unmarried sister, alone in the family home.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|97}} In the spring of 1904, Whipple's largest business venture suffered a catastrophic failure. Within months, he died due to a stroke at age 70. After Whipple's death, Susie was unable to support the upkeep of the expansive family home on what remained of the Phillips' estate. Later that year, she was forced to move herself and her son to a small [[Duplex (building)|duplex]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|96}} Lovecraft has called this time one of the darkest of his life, remarking in a 1934 letter that he saw no point in living anymore.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|98}} In fall of the same year, he started high school. Much like his earlier school years, Lovecraft was at times removed from school for long periods for what he termed \"near breakdowns.\" He did say, though, that while having some conflicts with teachers, he enjoyed high school, becoming close with a small circle of friends and performed well academically, excelling in particular at chemistry and physics.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|99}} Aside from a pause in 1904, he also resumed publishing the ''Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy'' as well as starting the ''Scientific Gazette'', which dealt mostly with chemistry.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|102}} It was also during this period that Lovecraft produced the first of the types of fiction he would later be known for, namely \"[[The Beast in the Cave]]\" and \"The Alchemist\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|116}}\n\nIt was in 1908, prior to his high school graduation, when Lovecraft suffered another health crisis of some sort, though this instance was seemingly more severe than any prior. The exact circumstances and causes remain unknown. The only direct records are Lovecraft's own later correspondence wherein he described it variously as a \"nervous collapse\" and \"a sort of breakdown,\" in one letter blaming it on the stress of high school despite his enjoying it. In another letter concerning the events of 1908, he notes, \"I was and am prey to intense headaches, insomnia, and general nervous weakness which prevents my continuous application to any thing.\" Though Lovecraft maintained that he was to attend Brown University after high school, he never graduated and never attended school again. Whether Lovecraft suffered from a physical ailment, a mental one, or some combination thereof has never been determined. An account from a high school classmate described Lovecraft as exhibiting \"terrible tics\" and that at times \"he'd be sitting in his seat and he'd suddenly up and jump.\" Harry Brobst, a psychology professor, examined the account and claimed that [[Sydenham's chorea|chorea minor]] was the most likely cause of Lovecraft's childhood symptoms while noting that instances of chorea minor after adolescence are very rare.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|126}} Lovecraft himself acknowledged in letters that he suffered from bouts of chorea as a child.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|27}} Brobst further ventured that Lovecraft's 1908 breakdown was attributed to a \"hysteroid seizure,\" a term that today usually denotes [[atypical depression]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|127}} In another letter concerning the events of 1908, Lovecraft stated that he \"could hardly bear to see or speak to anyone, & liked to shut out the world by pulling down dark shades & using artificial light.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|128}}\n\n===Earliest recognition ===\nNot much of Lovecraft and Susie's activities from late 1908 to 1913 are recorded.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|128}} Lovecraft mentions a steady continuation of their financial decline highlighted by a failed business venture of his uncle that cost Susie a large portion of their dwindling wealth. A friend of Susie, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being \"so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him.\" Despite Hess' protest that this was not the case, Susie maintained this stance.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|66}} For his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be \"a positive marvel of consideration\".<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|64}} A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often supposed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, she recognized as being recitations of Shakespeare, an activity that seemed to delight mother and son.\n\nDuring this period, Lovecraft revived his earlier scientific periodicals.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|128}} He endeavored to commit himself to the study of [[organic chemistry]], Susie buying the expensive glass chemistry assemblage he wanted.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |last=Poole |first=W.

Many beings of the Mythos were too powerful to be defeated by human opponents, and so horrific that direct knowledge of them meant insanity for the victim. When dealing with such beings, Lovecraft needed a way to provide [[Dramatic structure#Exposition|exposition]] and build tension without bringing the story to a premature end. Human followers gave him a way to reveal information about their \"gods\" in a diluted form, and also made it possible for his protagonists to win paltry victories. Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, envisioned \"savages\" as closer to supernatural knowledge unknown to civilized man.\n\n===Inherited guilt===\nAnother recurring theme in Lovecraft's stories is the idea that descendants in a bloodline can never escape the stain of crimes committed by their forebears, at least if the crimes are atrocious enough. Descendants may be very far removed, both in place and in time (and, indeed, in [[culpability]]), from the act itself, and yet, they may be haunted by the revenant past, e.g. \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\", \"[[The Lurking Fear]]\", \"[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]\", \"[[The Alchemist (short story)|The Alchemist]]\", ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'', \"[[The Doom that Came to Sarnath]]\" and ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''.\n\n===Fate===\nOften in Lovecraft's works, the protagonist is not in control of his own actions or finds it impossible to change course. Many of his characters would be free from danger if they simply managed to run away; however, this possibility either never arises or is somehow curtailed by some outside force, such as in \"[[The Colour Out of Space]]\" and \"[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]\". Often his characters are subject to a compulsive influence from powerful malevolent or indifferent beings. As with the inevitability of one's ancestry, eventually even running away, or death itself, provides no safety (''[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]'', \"[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]\", ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''). In some cases, this doom is manifest in the entirety of humanity, and no escape is possible (''[[The Shadow Out of Time]]'').\n\n===Civilization under threat===\nLovecraft was familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist [[Oswald Spengler]], whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall [[anti-modern]] worldview. Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is present in particular in ''At the Mountains of Madness''. S. T. Joshi, in ''H. P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West'', places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Joshi |first=S.

In some stories this struggle is at an individual level; many of his [[protagonist]]s are cultured, highly educated men who are gradually corrupted by some obscure and feared influence.\n\nIn such stories, the [[curse]] is often a hereditary one, either because of interbreeding with non-humans (e.g., ''[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]'' (1920), ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'' (1931)) or through direct magical influence (''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''). Physical and mental degradation often come together; this theme of 'tainted blood' may represent concerns relating to Lovecraft's own family history, particularly the death of his father due to what Lovecraft must have suspected to be a [[syphilis|syphilitic]] disorder.\n\nIn other tales, an entire society is threatened by barbarism. Sometimes the barbarism comes as an external threat, with a civilized race destroyed in war (e.g. \"[[Polaris (short story)|Polaris]]\"). Sometimes, an isolated pocket of humanity falls into decadence and [[atavism]] of its own accord (e.g. \"[[The Lurking Fear]]\"). But most often, such stories involve a civilized culture being gradually undermined by a malevolent underclass influenced by inhuman forces.\n\nIt is likely that the \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\" left Lovecraft disillusioned as he was still obscure and struggling with the basic necessities of daily life, combined with seeing non-Western European immigrants in New York City.\n\n===Race===\nRace is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks against the various non-Anglo-Saxon [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] and cultures in his work. As he grew older, his original Anglo-Saxon racial worldview softened into a classism or elitism which regarded the superior race to include all those self-ennobled through high culture. From the start, Lovecraft did not hold all [[white people]] in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed the English people and those of English descent.<ref name=\"joshimagic\">{{Cite book |last=Joshi |first=S.

Lovecraft portrays this potential for a growing gap of man's understanding of the universe as a potential for horror, most notably in \"The Colour Out of Space\", where the inability of science to comprehend a contaminated meteorite leads to horror.\n\nIn a letter to [[James F. Morton]] in 1923, Lovecraft specifically pointed to [[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|theory on relativity]] as throwing the world into chaos and making the cosmos a jest; in a letter to Woodburn Harris in 1929, he speculated that technological comforts risk the collapse of science. Indeed, at a time when men viewed science as limitless and powerful, Lovecraft imagined alternative potential and fearful outcomes. In \"The Call of Cthulhu\", Lovecraft's characters encounter architecture which is \"abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx |title=The Call of Cthulhu |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

Lovecraft's actual philosophy has been termed \"cosmic indifference\" and this is expressed in his fiction.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mosig |first=Yozan Dirk W. |date=August 1, 1985 |orig-year=first published 1979 |title=Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in Imaginative Literature |magazine=Crypt of Cthulhu |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=12\u201323}}</ref> Several of Lovecraft's stories of the Old Ones (alien beings of the Cthulhu Mythos) propose alternate mythic human origins in contrast to those found in the [[creation myth|creation]] stories of existing religions, expanding on a natural world view. For instance, in Lovecraft's ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', it is proposed that humankind was actually created as a slave race by the Old Ones, and that life on Earth as we know it evolved from scientific experiments abandoned by the Elder Things. Protagonist characters in Lovecraft are usually educated men, citing scientific and rational evidence to support their non-faith. ''[[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator]]'' reflects on the [[atheism]] common in academic circles. In ''[[The Silver Key]]'', the character [[Randolph Carter]] loses the ability to dream and seeks solace in religion, specifically [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalism]], but does not find it and ultimately loses faith.\n\nLovecraft himself adopted the stance of atheism early in life. In 1932, he wrote in a letter to [[Robert E. Howard]]:\n\n<blockquote>All I say is that I think it is damned unlikely that anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal survival of personality exist. They are the most preposterous and unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and I am not enough of a hairsplitter to pretend that I don't regard them as arrant and negligible moonshine. In theory, I am an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], but pending the appearance of radical evidence I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an atheist.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

Houdini's unexpected death later that year halted the project, but ''[[The Cancer of Superstition]]'' was partially completed by Lovecraft along with collaborator [[C. M. Eddy Jr.]] A previously unknown manuscript of the work was discovered in 2016 in a collection owned by a magic shop. The book states \"all superstitious beliefs are relics of a common 'prehistoric ignorance' in humans,\" and goes on to explore various superstitious beliefs in different cultures and times.\"<ref name=\"Flood\">{{Cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/16/hp-lovecraft-harry-houdini-manuscript-cancer-superstition-memorabilia |title=Lost HP Lovecraft work commissioned by Houdini escapes shackles of history |date=March 16, 2016 |work=The Guardian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008115009/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/16/hp-lovecraft-harry-houdini-manuscript-cancer-superstition-memorabilia |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Lovecraft Country ===\n{{main|Lovecraft Country}}\n\nLovecraft drew extensively from his native New England for settings in his fiction.

The exact locations of these municipalities were subject to change, as Lovecraft had shifting literary needs. They were based on areas that he thought were evocative. He then redefined them and changed their names to suit his purposes. After this, he would exaggerate their features. For example, Arkham was based on a town named [[Oakham, Massachusetts|Oakham]]. Lovecraft renamed his fictionalized version of Oakham to Arkham, and expanded it to include a nearby landmark.<ref name=\"murray54\" />\n\n==Appreciation==\n\n===Within the genre===\nBy 1957 [[Floyd C.

He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schoell |first=William |title=H.P.

This group of writers became known as the \"Lovecraft Circle,\" since their writing freely borrowed elements of Lovecraft's stories, with his encouragement: the mysterious books with disturbing names, the pantheon of ancient alien entities such as Cthulhu and Azathoth, and eldritch places such as the New England town of [[Arkham]] and its [[Miskatonic University]].\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death, the Lovecraft Circle carried on. August Derleth in particular added to and expanded on Lovecraft's vision, not without controversy. While Lovecraft considered his pantheon of alien gods a mere plot device, Derleth created an entire cosmology, complete with a war between the good [[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Gods]] and the evil [[Outer God]]s, such as [[Cthulhu]] and his ilk. The forces of good were supposed to have won, locking Cthulhu and others up beneath the earth, in the ocean, and so forth. Derleth's Cthulhu Mythos stories went on to associate different gods with the traditional four [[Classical element|elements of fire, air, earth and water]] \u2014 an artificial constraint which required rationalizations on Derleth's part as Lovecraft himself never envisioned such a scheme.\n\nLovecraft's fiction has been grouped into three categories by some critics. While Lovecraft did not refer to these categories himself, he did once write: \"There are my 'Poe' pieces and my '[[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Dunsany]] pieces' \u2014 but alas \u2014 where are any Lovecraft pieces?\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

[[Penguin Classics]] has at present issued three volumes of Lovecraft's works: ''[[The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories]]'', ''[[The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories]]'', and most recently ''[[The Dreams in the Witch House and Other Weird Stories]]''. They collect the standard texts as edited by S. T. Joshi, most of which were available in the Arkham House editions, with the exception of the restored text of ''The Shadow Out of Time'' from ''The Dreams in the Witch House'', which had been previously released by small-press publisher [[Hippocampus Press]]. In 2005 the prestigious [[Library of America]] canonized Lovecraft with a volume of his stories edited by [[Peter Straub]], and Random House's [[Modern Library]] line have issued the \"definitive edition\" of Lovecraft's ''At the Mountains of Madness'' (also including ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]''). In 2014, Liveright Publishing Corp./W. W. Norton published ''The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft'', edited by [[Leslie S. Klinger]], containing 22 of Lovecraft's tales, with an introduction by [[Alan Moore]]; in September 2019, the second volume of Klinger's annotations, ''The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft: Beyond Arkham'', containing another 25 of Lovecraft's tales, will appear, together with an introduction by [[Victor LaValle]]. Both volumes are heavily illustrated.\n\nLovecraft's poetry is collected in ''The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft'' (Night Shade Books, 2001), while much of his juvenilia, various essays on philosophical, political and literary topics, antiquarian travelogues, and other things, can be found in ''Miscellaneous Writings'' (Arkham House, 1989). Lovecraft's essay ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'', first published in 1927, is a historical survey of horror literature available with endnotes as ''The Annotated Supernatural Horror in Literature''.\n\n===Letters, correspondence, exchange, and contract work===\nAlthough Lovecraft is known mostly for his works of [[weird fiction]], the bulk of his writing consists of voluminous letters about a variety of topics, from weird fiction and art criticism to politics and history. Lovecraft's biographer [[L. Sprague de Camp]] estimates that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/letters/ |title=Lovecraft's Letters |date=September 18, 2019 |website=www.hplovecraft.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628015736/http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/letters/ |archive-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe sometimes dated his letters 200 years before the current date, which would have put the writing back in US colonial times, before the [[American Revolution]] (a war that offended his Anglophilia). He explained that he thought that the 18th and 20th centuries were the \"best,\" the former being a period of noble grace, and the latter a century of science.\n\nLovecraft was not an active letter-writer in youth. In 1931 he admitted: \"In youth I scarcely did any letter-writing&nbsp;\u2014 thanking anybody for a present was so much of an ordeal that I would rather have written a two hundred fifty-line pastoral or a twenty-page treatise on the rings of Saturn.\" (SL 3.369\u201370). The initial interest in letters stemmed from his correspondence with his cousin Phillips Gamwell but even more important was his involvement in the amateur journalism movement, which was initially responsible for the enormous number of letters Lovecraft produced.\n\nDespite his light letter-writing in youth, in later life his correspondence was so voluminous that it has been estimated that he may have written around 30,000 letters to various correspondents, a figure which places him second only to [[Voltaire]] as an epistolarian. Lovecraft's later correspondence is primarily to fellow weird fiction writers, rather than to the amateur journalist friends of his earlier years.\n\nLovecraft clearly states that his contact to numerous different people through letter-writing was one of the main factors in broadening his view of the world: \"I found myself opened up to dozens of points of view which would otherwise never have occurred to me. My understanding and sympathies were enlarged, and many of my social, political, and economic views were modified as a consequence of increased knowledge.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Joshi |first=S.

Lovecraft had specified that the young [[R. H. Barlow]] would serve as executor of his [[literary estate]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi, Schultz|2001|p=16|ref=hplencyclopedia}}</ref> but these instructions were not incorporated into the will. Nevertheless, his surviving aunt carried out his expressed wishes, and Barlow was given charge of the massive and complex literary estate upon Lovecraft's death.\n\nBarlow deposited the bulk of the papers, including the voluminous correspondence, with the [[John Hay Library]], and attempted to organize and maintain Lovecraft's other writing. [[August Derleth]], an older and more established writer than Barlow, vied for control of the literary estate. One result of these conflicts was the legal confusion over who owned what copyrights.\n\nAll works published before 1925 are [[public domain]] in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ22.pdf |title=How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work- U.S. Copyright Office |website=copyright.gov |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810065221/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ22.pdf |archive-date=August 10, 2010}}</ref> With respect to works published later, ownership of the copyrights is disputed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Before the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright lasted for 28 years from publication and a work that did not have its copyright renewed passed into the public domain. The [[Copyright Act of 1976]] retroactively extended this renewal period for all works to a period of 47 years and the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 added another 20 years to that, for a total of 95 years from publication. But everything turned on the renewal or expiration of copyright at the end of the first 28-year term.\n\nThe [[European Union]] [[Copyright Duration Directive]] of 1993 extended the copyrights to 70 years after the author's death. All of Lovecraft's works published during his lifetime became public domain in all 27 European Union countries on January 1, 2008. In those [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] countries that have implemented only the minimum copyright period, copyright expires 50 years after the author's death.\n\nLovecraft prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and part owners of Arkham House, August Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]], often claimed copyrights over Lovecraft's works. On October 9, 1947, Derleth purchased all rights to ''Weird Tales''. However, since April 1926 at the latest, Lovecraft had reserved to himself all second printing rights to stories published in ''Weird Tales''. ''Weird Tales'' may only have owned the rights to at most six of Lovecraft's tales. Again, even if Derleth did obtain the copyrights to Lovecraft's tales, there is no evidence that the copyrights were renewed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |title=Copyright |last=William |first=Johns |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003114117/http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2003}}</ref> Following Derleth's death in 1971, his attorney proclaimed that all of Lovecraft's literary material was part of the Derleth estate and that it would be \"protected to the fullest extent possible.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aetherial.net/lovecraft/arkham.html#13 |title=The Black Seas of Copyright: Arkham House Publishers and the H.P.

T. Joshi concludes in his biography of Lovecraft that Derleth's claims are \"almost certainly fictitious\" and that most of Lovecraft's works published in the amateur press are most likely now in the public domain. The copyright for Lovecraft's works would have been inherited by the only surviving heir named in his 1912 will, his aunt Annie Gamwell. When Gamwell died in 1941, the copyrights passed to her remaining descendants, Ethel Phillips Morrish and Edna Lewis, who then signed a document, sometimes referred to as the Morrish-Lewis gift, permitting Arkham House to republish Lovecraft's works while retaining the copyrights for themselves. Searches of the [[Library of Congress]] have failed to find any evidence that these copyrights were renewed after the 28-year period, making it likely that these works are now in the public domain.\n\nChaosium, publishers of the ''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game, have a trademark on the phrase ''The Call of Cthulhu'' for use in game products.

He was born into affluence, which ended with the death of his grandfather. In 1913, he wrote a critical letter to a [[pulp magazine]] that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. During the [[interwar period]], he wrote and published stories that focused on his interpretation of humanity's place in the universe. In his view, humanity was an unimportant part of an uncaring cosmos that could be swept away at any moment. These stories also included [[fantastic]] elements that represented the perceived fragility of [[anthropocentrism]].\n\nLovecraft was at the center of a wider body of authors known as \"The Lovecraft Circle.\" This group wrote stories that frequently shared details between them. He was also a prolific writer of letters. He maintained a correspondence with several different authors and literary proteges. According to some estimates, he wrote approximately 100,000 letters over the course of his lifetime.{{refn|This is according to L. Sprague de Camp and S. T.

He was virtually unknown during his lifetime and was almost exclusively published in [[pulp magazine]]s before he died in poverty at the age of 46, but is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors of supernatural horror fiction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schweitzer |first=Darrell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dX30AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=The%20verdict%20is%20now%20in:%20Lovecraft%20is%20the%20most%20important%20writer%20of%20supernatural%20horror%20fiction%20in%20English%20since%20Poe.&f=false |title=Discovering H.

He encouraged the young Lovecraft to have an appreciation of literature, especially [[classical literature]] and [[English poetry]].  In his old age he helped raise the young H. P. Lovecraft and educated him not only in the classics, but also in original [[weird tale]]s of \"winged horrors\" and \"deep, low, moaning sounds\" which he created for his grandchild's entertainment.  The exact sources of Phillips' weird tales have not been identified.  Lovecraft himself guessed that they originated from classic [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novelists]] like [[Ann Radcliffe]], [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], and [[Charles Maturin]]. On March 27, 1904, he was seized by a \u201cparalytic shock,\u201d (likely a stroke). He died the following day, at his home at 454 Angell Street.<ref>{{Cite book |last=de Camp |first=L.

Though it is not clear who reported Winfield's prior behavior to the hospital, medical records indicate that he had been \"doing and saying strange things at times\" for a year before his commitment.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|26}} Winfield spent five years in Butler before dying in 1898. His death certificate listed the cause of death as [[general paresis of the insane|general paresis]], a term synonymous with late-stage [[syphilis]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|22}} Throughout his life, Lovecraft maintained that his father fell into a paralytic state, due to insomnia and being overworked, and remained that way until his death. It is unknown whether Lovecraft was simply kept ignorant of his father's illness or whether his later remarks were intentionally misleading.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|26}}\n\n;Doting mother\nAfter his father's hospitalization, Lovecraft resided in the family home with his mother, his maternal aunts Lillian and Annie, and his maternal grandparents Whipple and Robie.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|28}} According to the accounts of family friends, Susie doted on the young Lovecraft to a fault, pampering him and never letting him out of her sight.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |last=de Camp |first=L.

When home, Whipple would share weird tales of his own invention and show Lovecraft objects of art he had acquired in his European travels. Lovecraft also credits Whipple with being instrumental in overcoming his fear of the dark when Whipple forced Lovecraft, at five years old, to walk through several darkened rooms in the family home.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|28}} It was in this period that Lovecraft was introduced to some of his earliest literary influences such as ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' illustrated by [[Dor\u00e9]], ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a gift from his mother, [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Age of Fable]]'' and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|33, 36}}\n\nWhile there is no indication that Lovecraft was particularly close to his grandmother Robie, her death in 1896 had a profound effect. By his own account, it sent his family into \"a gloom from which it never fully recovered.\" His mother's and aunts' wearing of black mourning dresses \"terrified\" him, and it is at this time that Lovecraft, approximately five-and-a-half years old, started having nightmares that would inform his later writing. Specifically, he began to have recurring nightmares of beings he termed \"night-gaunts\"; their appearance he credited to the influence of Dor\u00e9's illustrations, which would \"whirl me through space at a sickening rate of speed, the while fretting & impelling me with their detestable tridents.\" Thirty years later, night gaunts would appear in Lovecraft's writing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|34}}\n\nLovecraft's earliest known literary works began at age seven with poems restyling the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and other mythological stories.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|38}} Lovecraft has said that as a child he was enamored of the Roman pantheon of gods, accepting them as genuine expressions of divinity and foregoing his Christian upbringing. He recalled, at five years old, being told Santa Claus did not exist and retorting by asking why \"God is not equally a myth.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|42}} At the age of eight, he took a keen interest in the sciences, particularly astronomy and chemistry. He also examined the anatomy books available to him in the family library, learning the specifics of human reproduction that had yet to be explained to him, and found that it \"virtually killed my interest in the subject.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|60}} In 1902, according to Lovecraft's own correspondence, astronomy became a guiding influence on his world view. He began producing the periodical ''Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy'', of which 69 issues survive, using the [[hectograph]] printing method.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|84}} Lovecraft went in and out of elementary school repeatedly, oftentimes with home tutors making up for those lost school years, missing time due to health concerns that are not entirely clear. The written recollections of his peers described him as both withdrawn yet openly welcoming to anyone who shared his current fascination with astronomy, inviting anyone to look through the telescope he prized.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|90}}\n\nBy 1900, Whipple's various business concerns were suffering a downturn and slowly reducing his family's wealth. He was forced to let the family's hired servants go, leaving Lovecraft, Whipple, and Susie, being the only unmarried sister, alone in the family home.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|97}} In the spring of 1904, Whipple's largest business venture suffered a catastrophic failure. Within months, he died due to a stroke at age 70. After Whipple's death, Susie was unable to support the upkeep of the expansive family home on what remained of the Phillips' estate. Later that year, she was forced to move herself and her son to a small [[Duplex (building)|duplex]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|96}} Lovecraft has called this time one of the darkest of his life, remarking in a 1934 letter that he saw no point in living anymore.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|98}} In fall of the same year, he started high school. Much like his earlier school years, Lovecraft was at times removed from school for long periods for what he termed \"near breakdowns.\" He did say, though, that while having some conflicts with teachers, he enjoyed high school, becoming close with a small circle of friends and performed well academically, excelling in particular at chemistry and physics.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|99}} Aside from a pause in 1904, he also resumed publishing the ''Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy'' as well as starting the ''Scientific Gazette'', which dealt mostly with chemistry.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|102}} It was also during this period that Lovecraft produced the first of the types of fiction he would later be known for, namely \"[[The Beast in the Cave]]\" and \"The Alchemist\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|116}}\n\nIt was in 1908, prior to his high school graduation, when Lovecraft suffered another health crisis of some sort, though this instance was seemingly more severe than any prior. The exact circumstances and causes remain unknown. The only direct records are Lovecraft's own later correspondence wherein he described it variously as a \"nervous collapse\" and \"a sort of breakdown,\" in one letter blaming it on the stress of high school despite his enjoying it. In another letter concerning the events of 1908, he notes, \"I was and am prey to intense headaches, insomnia, and general nervous weakness which prevents my continuous application to any thing.\" Though Lovecraft maintained that he was to attend Brown University after high school, he never graduated and never attended school again. Whether Lovecraft suffered from a physical ailment, a mental one, or some combination thereof has never been determined. An account from a high school classmate described Lovecraft as exhibiting \"terrible tics\" and that at times \"he'd be sitting in his seat and he'd suddenly up and jump.\" Harry Brobst, a psychology professor, examined the account and claimed that [[Sydenham's chorea|chorea minor]] was the most likely cause of Lovecraft's childhood symptoms while noting that instances of chorea minor after adolescence are very rare.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|126}} Lovecraft himself acknowledged in letters that he suffered from bouts of chorea as a child.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|27}} Brobst further ventured that Lovecraft's 1908 breakdown was attributed to a \"hysteroid seizure,\" a term that today usually denotes [[atypical depression]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|127}} In another letter concerning the events of 1908, Lovecraft stated that he \"could hardly bear to see or speak to anyone, & liked to shut out the world by pulling down dark shades & using artificial light.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|128}}\n\n===Earliest recognition ===\nNot much of Lovecraft and Susie's activities from late 1908 to 1913 are recorded.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|128}} Lovecraft mentions a steady continuation of their financial decline highlighted by a failed business venture of his uncle that cost Susie a large portion of their dwindling wealth. A friend of Susie, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being \"so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him.\" Despite Hess' protest that this was not the case, Susie maintained this stance.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|66}} For his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be \"a positive marvel of consideration\".<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|64}} A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often supposed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, she recognized as being recitations of Shakespeare, an activity that seemed to delight mother and son.\n\nDuring this period, Lovecraft revived his earlier scientific periodicals.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|128}} He endeavored to commit himself to the study of [[organic chemistry]], Susie buying the expensive glass chemistry assemblage he wanted.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |last=Poole |first=W.

Called ''Providence in 2000 A.D.,'' the poem envisioned a future where people of English heritage were displaced by immigrants.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|137}} Surviving unpublished poems from this period, most notoriously \"On the Creation of Niggers\", were also emblematic of the xenophobia and racism inherent in much of Lovecraft's later work.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|138}}\n\nIn 1911, Lovecraft's letters to editors began appearing in pulp and weird fiction magazines, most notably ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|140}} A 1913 letter critical of [[Frederick J. Jackson|Fred Jackson]], a prominent writer for Argosy, started Lovecraft down a path that would greatly affect his life. Lovecraft described Jackson's stories as \"trivial, effeminate, and, in places, coarse.\" Continuing, Lovecraft said that Jackson's characters exhibit the \"delicate passions and emotions proper to negroes and anthropoid apes.\" This sparked a nearly year-long feud in the letters section of ''Argosy'' between Lovecraft, along with his occasional supporters, and the majority of readers critical of his view of Jackson. Lovecraft's biggest critic was John Russell, who often replied in verse, and to whom Lovecraft felt compelled to reply because he respected Russell's writing skills.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|145}} The most immediate effect of the feud was the recognition garnered from [[Edward F.

He contrasted this with his view of \"professional publication,\" which he termed as writing for journals and publishers he considered respectable. He thought of amateur journalism as training and practice for a professional career.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|165}} Lovecraft was appointed to chairman of the Department of Public Criticism of the UAPA in late 1914.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|168}} He used this position to advocate for his, what many considered peculiar, insistence on the superiority of English language usage that most writers already considered archaic. Emblematic of the Anglophile opinions he maintained throughout his life, he openly criticized other UAPA contributors for their \"Americanisms\" and \"slang.\" Often these criticisms were couched in xenophobic and racist arguments bemoaning the \"bastardization\" of the \"national language\" by immigrants.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|169}} In mid-1915, Lovecraft was elected to the position of first vice-president of the UAPA.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|180}} Two years later, he was elected president and appointed other board members that mostly shared his view on the supremacy of classical English over modern American English.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|182}} Another significant event of this time was the beginning of [[World War I]]. Lovecraft published multiple criticisms of the U.S. government's and the American public's reluctance to join the war to protect England, which he viewed as America's homeland.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|210}}\n\nIn 1916, Lovecraft published his early short story \"[[The Alchemist (short story)|The Alchemist]]\" in the main UAPA journal, a departure from his usual verse. Due in no small part to the encouragement of [[W.

Lovecraft made efforts to support his wife through regular jobs, but his lack of previous work experience meant he lacked proven marketable skills.

Baird was replaced with [[Farnsworth Wright]], whose writing Lovecraft had criticized. Lovecraft's submissions were often rejected by Wright. (This may have been partially due to censorship guidelines imposed in the aftermath of a ''Weird Tales'' story that hinted at necrophilia, although after Lovecraft's death, Wright accepted many of the stories he had originally rejected.)<ref name=\"JoshiSchultz2001\" /><ref name=\"Tyson2010\" />\n\n===Brooklyn===\nGreene, moving where the work was, relocated to Cincinnati, and then to Cleveland; her employment required constant travel.

In August 1925, he wrote \"[[The Horror at Red Hook]]\" and \"[[He (short story)|He]]\", in the latter of which the narrator says \"My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration [...]  I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master, paralyze, and annihilate me.\" It was at around this time he wrote the outline for \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\", with its theme of the insignificance of all humanity.

Joshi |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3oH_VdH3BcC&pg=PA319}}</ref>\n\n===Non-human influences on humanity===\nThe beings of Lovecraft's [[mythos]] often have human servants; [[Cthulhu]], for instance, is worshipped under various names by [[cult]]s{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} among both the [[Greenlandic Inuit]] and [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo circles of Louisiana]], and in many other parts of the world.\n\nThese worshippers served a useful narrative purpose for Lovecraft. Many beings of the Mythos were too powerful to be defeated by human opponents, and so horrific that direct knowledge of them meant insanity for the victim. When dealing with such beings, Lovecraft needed a way to provide [[Dramatic structure#Exposition|exposition]] and build tension without bringing the story to a premature end. Human followers gave him a way to reveal information about their \"gods\" in a diluted form, and also made it possible for his protagonists to win paltry victories. Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, envisioned \"savages\" as closer to supernatural knowledge unknown to civilized man.\n\n===Inherited guilt===\nAnother recurring theme in Lovecraft's stories is the idea that descendants in a bloodline can never escape the stain of crimes committed by their forebears, at least if the crimes are atrocious enough. Descendants may be very far removed, both in place and in time (and, indeed, in [[culpability]]), from the act itself, and yet, they may be haunted by the revenant past, e.g. \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\", \"[[The Lurking Fear]]\", \"[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]\", \"[[The Alchemist (short story)|The Alchemist]]\", ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'', \"[[The Doom that Came to Sarnath]]\" and ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''.\n\n===Fate===\nOften in Lovecraft's works, the protagonist is not in control of his own actions or finds it impossible to change course. Many of his characters would be free from danger if they simply managed to run away; however, this possibility either never arises or is somehow curtailed by some outside force, such as in \"[[The Colour Out of Space]]\" and \"[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]\". Often his characters are subject to a compulsive influence from powerful malevolent or indifferent beings. As with the inevitability of one's ancestry, eventually even running away, or death itself, provides no safety (''[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]'', \"[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]\", ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''). In some cases, this doom is manifest in the entirety of humanity, and no escape is possible (''[[The Shadow Out of Time]]'').\n\n===Civilization under threat===\nLovecraft was familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist [[Oswald Spengler]], whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall [[anti-modern]] worldview. Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is present in particular in ''At the Mountains of Madness''. S. T. Joshi, in ''H. P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West'', places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Joshi |first=S.

In some stories this struggle is at an individual level; many of his [[protagonist]]s are cultured, highly educated men who are gradually corrupted by some obscure and feared influence.\n\nIn such stories, the [[curse]] is often a hereditary one, either because of interbreeding with non-humans (e.g., ''[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]'' (1920), ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'' (1931)) or through direct magical influence (''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward''). Physical and mental degradation often come together; this theme of 'tainted blood' may represent concerns relating to Lovecraft's own family history, particularly the death of his father due to what Lovecraft must have suspected to be a [[syphilis|syphilitic]] disorder.\n\nIn other tales, an entire society is threatened by barbarism. Sometimes the barbarism comes as an external threat, with a civilized race destroyed in war (e.g. \"[[Polaris (short story)|Polaris]]\"). Sometimes, an isolated pocket of humanity falls into decadence and [[atavism]] of its own accord (e.g. \"[[The Lurking Fear]]\"). But most often, such stories involve a civilized culture being gradually undermined by a malevolent underclass influenced by inhuman forces.\n\nIt is likely that the \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\" left Lovecraft disillusioned as he was still obscure and struggling with the basic necessities of daily life, combined with seeing non-Western European immigrants in New York City.\n\n===Race===\nRace is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks against the various non-Anglo-Saxon [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] and cultures in his work. As he grew older, his original Anglo-Saxon racial worldview softened into a classism or elitism which regarded the superior race to include all those self-ennobled through high culture. From the start, Lovecraft did not hold all [[white people]] in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed the English people and those of English descent.<ref name=\"joshimagic\">{{Cite book |last=Joshi |first=S.

Lovecraft portrays this potential for a growing gap of man's understanding of the universe as a potential for horror, most notably in \"The Colour Out of Space\", where the inability of science to comprehend a contaminated meteorite leads to horror.\n\nIn a letter to [[James F. Morton]] in 1923, Lovecraft specifically pointed to [[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|theory on relativity]] as throwing the world into chaos and making the cosmos a jest; in a letter to Woodburn Harris in 1929, he speculated that technological comforts risk the collapse of science. Indeed, at a time when men viewed science as limitless and powerful, Lovecraft imagined alternative potential and fearful outcomes. In \"The Call of Cthulhu\", Lovecraft's characters encounter architecture which is \"abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx |title=The Call of Cthulhu |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

Lovecraft's actual philosophy has been termed \"cosmic indifference\" and this is expressed in his fiction.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mosig |first=Yozan Dirk W. |date=August 1, 1985 |orig-year=first published 1979 |title=Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in Imaginative Literature |magazine=Crypt of Cthulhu |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=12\u201323}}</ref> Several of Lovecraft's stories of the Old Ones (alien beings of the Cthulhu Mythos) propose alternate mythic human origins in contrast to those found in the [[creation myth|creation]] stories of existing religions, expanding on a natural world view. For instance, in Lovecraft's ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', it is proposed that humankind was actually created as a slave race by the Old Ones, and that life on Earth as we know it evolved from scientific experiments abandoned by the Elder Things. Protagonist characters in Lovecraft are usually educated men, citing scientific and rational evidence to support their non-faith. ''[[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator]]'' reflects on the [[atheism]] common in academic circles. In ''[[The Silver Key]]'', the character [[Randolph Carter]] loses the ability to dream and seeks solace in religion, specifically [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalism]], but does not find it and ultimately loses faith.\n\nLovecraft himself adopted the stance of atheism early in life. In 1932, he wrote in a letter to [[Robert E. Howard]]:\n\n<blockquote>All I say is that I think it is damned unlikely that anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal survival of personality exist. They are the most preposterous and unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and I am not enough of a hairsplitter to pretend that I don't regard them as arrant and negligible moonshine. In theory, I am an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], but pending the appearance of radical evidence I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an atheist.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

Houdini's unexpected death later that year halted the project, but ''[[The Cancer of Superstition]]'' was partially completed by Lovecraft along with collaborator [[C. M. Eddy Jr.]] A previously unknown manuscript of the work was discovered in 2016 in a collection owned by a magic shop. The book states \"all superstitious beliefs are relics of a common 'prehistoric ignorance' in humans,\" and goes on to explore various superstitious beliefs in different cultures and times.\"<ref name=\"Flood\">{{Cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/16/hp-lovecraft-harry-houdini-manuscript-cancer-superstition-memorabilia |title=Lost HP Lovecraft work commissioned by Houdini escapes shackles of history |date=March 16, 2016 |work=The Guardian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008115009/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/16/hp-lovecraft-harry-houdini-manuscript-cancer-superstition-memorabilia |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Lovecraft Country ===\n{{main|Lovecraft Country}}\n\nLovecraft drew extensively from his native New England for settings in his fiction. Numerous historical cities and towns are mentioned, and several fictionalised version of them make frequent appearances in his stories.{{refn|These fictional locations include [[Arkham]], [[Dunwich (Lovecraft)|Dunwich]], [[Innsmouth]], and Kingsport.<ref name=\"murray54\">{{Cite journal |last=Murray |first=Will |author-link=Will Murray |date=October 1, 1986 |title=In Search of Arkham Country |url=https://archive.org/details/Lovecraft_Studies_13v05n02_1986-Fall_CosmicJukebox/page/n13/mode/2up |journal=Lovecraft Studies |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=54\u201367}}</ref>|group= n}} These municipalities are located in the western half of a fictionalized version of Massachusetts. The exact locations of these municipalities were subject to change, as Lovecraft had shifting literary needs. They were based on areas that he thought were evocative. He then redefined them and changed their names to suit his purposes. After this, he would exaggerate their features. For example, Arkham was based on a town named [[Oakham, Massachusetts|Oakham]]. Lovecraft renamed his fictionalized version of Oakham to Arkham, and expanded it to include a nearby landmark.<ref name=\"murray54\" />\n\n==Appreciation==\n\n===Within the genre===\nBy 1957 [[Floyd C.

He did, however, correspond regularly with other contemporary writers such as Clark Ashton Smith and August Derleth,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schoell |first=William |title=H.P. Lovecraft: Master of Weird Fiction |publisher=Morgan Reynolds |year=2004 |isbn=9781931798150 |pages=8\u201340}}</ref> who became good friends of his, even though they never met in person. This group of writers became known as the \"Lovecraft Circle,\" since their writing freely borrowed elements of Lovecraft's stories, with his encouragement: the mysterious books with disturbing names, the pantheon of ancient alien entities such as Cthulhu and Azathoth, and eldritch places such as the New England town of [[Arkham]] and its [[Miskatonic University]].\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death, the Lovecraft Circle carried on. August Derleth in particular added to and expanded on Lovecraft's vision, not without controversy. While Lovecraft considered his pantheon of alien gods a mere plot device, Derleth created an entire cosmology, complete with a war between the good [[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Gods]] and the evil [[Outer God]]s, such as [[Cthulhu]] and his ilk. The forces of good were supposed to have won, locking Cthulhu and others up beneath the earth, in the ocean, and so forth. Derleth's Cthulhu Mythos stories went on to associate different gods with the traditional four [[Classical element|elements of fire, air, earth and water]] \u2014 an artificial constraint which required rationalizations on Derleth's part as Lovecraft himself never envisioned such a scheme.\n\nLovecraft's fiction has been grouped into three categories by some critics. While Lovecraft did not refer to these categories himself, he did once write: \"There are my 'Poe' pieces and my '[[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Dunsany]] pieces' \u2014 but alas \u2014 where are any Lovecraft pieces?\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lovecraft |first=H.

Both volumes are heavily illustrated.\n\nLovecraft's poetry is collected in ''The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft'' (Night Shade Books, 2001), while much of his juvenilia, various essays on philosophical, political and literary topics, antiquarian travelogues, and other things, can be found in ''Miscellaneous Writings'' (Arkham House, 1989). Lovecraft's essay ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'', first published in 1927, is a historical survey of horror literature available with endnotes as ''The Annotated Supernatural Horror in Literature''.\n\n===Letters, correspondence, exchange, and contract work===\nAlthough Lovecraft is known mostly for his works of [[weird fiction]], the bulk of his writing consists of voluminous letters about a variety of topics, from weird fiction and art criticism to politics and history. Lovecraft's biographer [[L. Sprague de Camp]] estimates that Lovecraft wrote 100,000 letters in his lifetime, a fifth of which are believed to survive.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/letters/ |title=Lovecraft's Letters |date=September 18, 2019 |website=www.hplovecraft.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628015736/http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/letters/ |archive-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe sometimes dated his letters 200 years before the current date, which would have put the writing back in US colonial times, before the [[American Revolution]] (a war that offended his Anglophilia). He explained that he thought that the 18th and 20th centuries were the \"best,\" the former being a period of noble grace, and the latter a century of science.\n\nLovecraft was not an active letter-writer in youth. In 1931 he admitted: \"In youth I scarcely did any letter-writing&nbsp;\u2014 thanking anybody for a present was so much of an ordeal that I would rather have written a two hundred fifty-line pastoral or a twenty-page treatise on the rings of Saturn.\" (SL 3.369\u201370). The initial interest in letters stemmed from his correspondence with his cousin Phillips Gamwell but even more important was his involvement in the amateur journalism movement, which was initially responsible for the enormous number of letters Lovecraft produced.\n\nDespite his light letter-writing in youth, in later life his correspondence was so voluminous that it has been estimated that he may have written around 30,000 letters to various correspondents, a figure which places him second only to [[Voltaire]] as an epistolarian. Lovecraft's later correspondence is primarily to fellow weird fiction writers, rather than to the amateur journalist friends of his earlier years.\n\nLovecraft clearly states that his contact to numerous different people through letter-writing was one of the main factors in broadening his view of the world: \"I found myself opened up to dozens of points of view which would otherwise never have occurred to me. My understanding and sympathies were enlarged, and many of my social, political, and economic views were modified as a consequence of increased knowledge.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Joshi |first=S.

Other publishers are [[Hippocampus Press]] (''Letters to Alfred Galpin'' ''et al.''), [[Night Shade Books]] (''Mysteries of Time and Spirit: The Letters of H. P.

Joshi]] is supervising an ongoing series of volumes collecting Lovecraft's unabridged letters to particular correspondents.\n\n===Copyright and other legal issues===\nDespite several claims to the contrary, there is currently no evidence that any company or individual owns the copyright to any of Lovecraft's work, and it is generally accepted that it has passed into the public domain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |title=The H.

Works he published during his lifetime between 1925 and 1937 will indisputably be out of copyright as they enter the public domain annually between 2021 and 2033 (pre-1978 works do not use the life+70 rule in the USA).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain |title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States &#124; Copyright Information Center |website=copyright.cornell.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911204703/https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain |archive-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere has been controversy over the [[copyright]] status of many of Lovecraft's works, especially his later works. Lovecraft had specified that the young [[R. H. Barlow]] would serve as executor of his [[literary estate]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Joshi, Schultz|2001|p=16|ref=hplencyclopedia}}</ref> but these instructions were not incorporated into the will. Nevertheless, his surviving aunt carried out his expressed wishes, and Barlow was given charge of the massive and complex literary estate upon Lovecraft's death.\n\nBarlow deposited the bulk of the papers, including the voluminous correspondence, with the [[John Hay Library]], and attempted to organize and maintain Lovecraft's other writing. [[August Derleth]], an older and more established writer than Barlow, vied for control of the literary estate. One result of these conflicts was the legal confusion over who owned what copyrights.\n\nAll works published before 1925 are [[public domain]] in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ22.pdf |title=How to Investigate the Copyright Status of a Work- U.S. Copyright Office |website=copyright.gov |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810065221/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ22.pdf |archive-date=August 10, 2010}}</ref> With respect to works published later, ownership of the copyrights is disputed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Before the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright lasted for 28 years from publication and a work that did not have its copyright renewed passed into the public domain. The [[Copyright Act of 1976]] retroactively extended this renewal period for all works to a period of 47 years and the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 added another 20 years to that, for a total of 95 years from publication. But everything turned on the renewal or expiration of copyright at the end of the first 28-year term.\n\nThe [[European Union]] [[Copyright Duration Directive]] of 1993 extended the copyrights to 70 years after the author's death. All of Lovecraft's works published during his lifetime became public domain in all 27 European Union countries on January 1, 2008. In those [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] countries that have implemented only the minimum copyright period, copyright expires 50 years after the author's death.\n\nLovecraft prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and part owners of Arkham House, August Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]], often claimed copyrights over Lovecraft's works. On October 9, 1947, Derleth purchased all rights to ''Weird Tales''. However, since April 1926 at the latest, Lovecraft had reserved to himself all second printing rights to stories published in ''Weird Tales''. ''Weird Tales'' may only have owned the rights to at most six of Lovecraft's tales. Again, even if Derleth did obtain the copyrights to Lovecraft's tales, there is no evidence that the copyrights were renewed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |title=Copyright |last=William |first=Johns |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003114117/http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/copyrights.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2003}}</ref> Following Derleth's death in 1971, his attorney proclaimed that all of Lovecraft's literary material was part of the Derleth estate and that it would be \"protected to the fullest extent possible.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aetherial.net/lovecraft/arkham.html#13 |title=The Black Seas of Copyright: Arkham House Publishers and the H.P.

T. Joshi concludes in his biography of Lovecraft that Derleth's claims are \"almost certainly fictitious\" and that most of Lovecraft's works published in the amateur press are most likely now in the public domain. The copyright for Lovecraft's works would have been inherited by the only surviving heir named in his 1912 will, his aunt Annie Gamwell. When Gamwell died in 1941, the copyrights passed to her remaining descendants, Ethel Phillips Morrish and Edna Lewis, who then signed a document, sometimes referred to as the Morrish-Lewis gift, permitting Arkham House to republish Lovecraft's works while retaining the copyrights for themselves. Searches of the [[Library of Congress]] have failed to find any evidence that these copyrights were renewed after the 28-year period, making it likely that these works are now in the public domain.\n\nChaosium, publishers of the ''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game, have a trademark on the phrase ''The Call of Cthulhu'' for use in game products.

Immaculata answered a growing need for Catholic secondary education on the Westbank.   Located in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]], the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]] served Immaculata from its inception until May 1979. In August 1979, the [[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco|Salesian Sisters]] came to Immaculata.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331233623/http://www.immaculatahigh.org/History.html|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The founding pastor, Msgr.

At the time, however, the absence of a boys' Catholic High School in the area prompted parents to seek admission also for their sons.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=cher19670202-01.1.14&srpos=91&e=-------en-20-cher-81-byDA-txt-txIN-%22Archbishop+Shaw+High+School%22------|title=Clarion Herald 2 February 1967 \u2014 Catholic Research Resources Alliance|website=thecatholicnewsarchive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nOn September 10, 1956, Immaculata High School opened its doors to 50 freshmen. In 1960, 24 students comprised the first graduating class; the total enrollment was 188 in that year. Immaculata continued as a co-ed school until the opening of [[Archbishop Shaw High School]] in 1962.  Archbishop Shaw began with only a Freshman class of 9th grade boys and added successive grades each year thereafter.

Immaculata answered a growing need for Catholic secondary education on the Westbank.   Located in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]], the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]] served Immaculata from its inception until May 1979. In August 1979, the [[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco|Salesian Sisters]] came to Immaculata. The founding pastor, Msgr. Paul Gaudin, envisioned a girls' school. At the time, however, the absence of a boys' Catholic High School in the area prompted parents to seek admission also for their sons.\n\nOn September 10, 1956, Immaculata High School opened its doors to 50 freshmen. In 1960, 24 students comprised the first graduating class; the total enrollment was 188 in that year.

Galaxies, for instance, are a million times more dense than the universe's mean density.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinNAR\"/>  The current belief is that the universe was built in a bottom-up fashion, meaning that the small anisotropies of the early universe acted as gravitational seeds for the structure observed today. Overdense regions attract more matter, whereas underdense regions attract less, and thus these small anisotropies, seen in the CMB, became the large scale structures in the universe today.\n\n==Cosmic sound==\nImagine an overdense region of the [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]].  While this region of overdensity [[gravitationally]] attracts matter towards it, the heat of photon-matter interactions creates a large amount of outward [[pressure]].  These counteracting forces of gravity and pressure created [[oscillations]], analogous to [[sound waves]] created in air by pressure differences.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>\n\nThis overdense region contains [[dark matter]], [[baryons]] and [[photons]].  The pressure results in spherical sound waves of both baryons and photons moving with a speed slightly over half the [[speed of light]]<ref name=\"ref:SunyaevZeldovich\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Sunyaev |first=R.\n |last2=Zeldovich |first2=Ya.

The dark matter interacts only gravitationally, and so it stays at the center of the sound wave, the origin of the overdensity.  Before [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the photons and baryons moved outwards together.  After decoupling the photons were no longer interacting with the baryonic matter and they diffused away.  That relieved the pressure on the system, leaving behind shells of baryonic matter.  Out of all those shells, representing different sound waves wavelengths, the resonant shell corresponds to the first one as it is that shell that travels the same distance for all overdensities before decoupling. This radius is often referred to as the sound horizon.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  Without the photo-baryon pressure driving the system outwards, the only remaining force on the baryons was gravitational.  Therefore, the baryons and dark matter (left behind at the center of the perturbation) formed a configuration which included overdensities of matter both at the original site of the anisotropy and in the shell at the sound horizon for that anisotropy.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>\n\nMany such anisotropies created the ripples in the density of space that attracted matter and eventually [[galaxies]] formed in a similar pattern. Therefore, one would expect to see a greater number of galaxies separated by the sound horizon than at other length scales.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>{{clarify|date=August 2015}}  This particular configuration of matter occurred at each anisotropy in the early universe, and therefore the universe is not composed of one sound ripple,<ref>See http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~deisenst/acousticpeak/anim.gif</ref> but many overlapping ripples.<ref>See http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~deisenst/acousticpeak/anim_many.gif</ref>  As an analogy, imagine dropping many pebbles into a pond and watching the resulting wave patterns in the water.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinNAR\"/>  It is not possible to observe this preferred separation of galaxies on the sound horizon scale by eye, but one can measure this artifact [[statistically]] by looking at the separations of large numbers of galaxies.\n\n==Standard ruler==\nThe physics of the propagation of the baryon waves in the [[early universe]] is fairly simple; as a result cosmologists can predict the size of the sound horizon at the time of [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].  In addition the [[CMB]] provides a measurement of this scale to high accuracy.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  However, in the time between recombination and present day, the universe has been [[Expanding universe|expanding]].  This expansion is well supported by [[Hubble's law|observations]] and is one of the foundations of the [[Big Bang|Big Bang Model]].  In the late 1990s, observations of [[supernova]]e<ref name=\"ref:Perlmutter\"/> determined that not only is the universe expanding, it is expanding at an increasing rate.  A better understanding of the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]], or [[dark energy]], has become one of the most important questions in cosmology today.  In order to understand the nature of the dark energy, it is important to have a variety of ways of measuring the acceleration.  BAO can add to the body of knowledge about this acceleration by comparing observations of the sound horizon today (using clustering of galaxies) to that of the sound horizon at the time of recombination (using the CMB).<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  Thus BAO provides a measuring stick with which to better understand the nature of the acceleration, completely independent from the [[Dark energy#Supernovae|supernova technique]].\n\n==BAO signal in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey==\n<!--[[File:Sloan BAO Slice.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 3: A slice through the SDSS map of the distribution of galaxies.

The result of compiling the SDSS data is a three-dimensional map of objects in the nearby universe: the SDSS catalog.  The SDSS catalog provides a picture of the distribution of matter in a large enough portion of the universe that one can search for a BAO signal by noting whether there is a statistically significant overabundance of galaxies separated by the predicted sound horizon distance.\n\nThe SDSS team looked at a sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies (LRGs), over 3,816 square-degrees of sky (approximately five billion [[light years]] in diameter) and out to a [[redshift]] of {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0.47}}.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  They analyzed the clustering of these galaxies by calculating a [[Correlation function (astronomy)|two-point correlation function]] on the data.<ref name=\"ref:LandySzalay\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Landy |first=S.

Galaxies, for instance, are a million times more dense than the universe's mean density.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinNAR\"/>  The current belief is that the universe was built in a bottom-up fashion, meaning that the small anisotropies of the early universe acted as gravitational seeds for the structure observed today. Overdense regions attract more matter, whereas underdense regions attract less, and thus these small anisotropies, seen in the CMB, became the large scale structures in the universe today.\n\n==Cosmic sound==\nImagine an overdense region of the [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]].  While this region of overdensity [[gravitationally]] attracts matter towards it, the heat of photon-matter interactions creates a large amount of outward [[pressure]].  These counteracting forces of gravity and pressure created [[oscillations]], analogous to [[sound waves]] created in air by pressure differences.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>\n\nThis overdense region contains [[dark matter]], [[baryons]] and [[photons]].

The dark matter interacts only gravitationally, and so it stays at the center of the sound wave, the origin of the overdensity.  Before [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the photons and baryons moved outwards together.  After decoupling the photons were no longer interacting with the baryonic matter and they diffused away.  That relieved the pressure on the system, leaving behind shells of baryonic matter.  Out of all those shells, representing different sound waves wavelengths, the resonant shell corresponds to the first one as it is that shell that travels the same distance for all overdensities before decoupling. This radius is often referred to as the sound horizon.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  Without the photo-baryon pressure driving the system outwards, the only remaining force on the baryons was gravitational.  Therefore, the baryons and dark matter (left behind at the center of the perturbation) formed a configuration which included overdensities of matter both at the original site of the anisotropy and in the shell at the sound horizon for that anisotropy.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>\n\nMany such anisotropies created the ripples in the density of space that attracted matter and eventually [[galaxies]] formed in a similar pattern. Therefore, one would expect to see a greater number of galaxies separated by the sound horizon than at other length scales.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>{{clarify|date=August 2015}}  This particular configuration of matter occurred at each anisotropy in the early universe, and therefore the universe is not composed of one sound ripple,<ref>See http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~deisenst/acousticpeak/anim.gif</ref> but many overlapping ripples.<ref>See http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~deisenst/acousticpeak/anim_many.gif</ref>  As an analogy, imagine dropping many pebbles into a pond and watching the resulting wave patterns in the water.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinNAR\"/>  It is not possible to observe this preferred separation of galaxies on the sound horizon scale by eye, but one can measure this artifact [[statistically]] by looking at the separations of large numbers of galaxies.\n\n==Standard ruler==\nThe physics of the propagation of the baryon waves in the [[early universe]] is fairly simple; as a result cosmologists can predict the size of the sound horizon at the time of [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].  In addition the [[CMB]] provides a measurement of this scale to high accuracy.<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  However, in the time between recombination and present day, the universe has been [[Expanding universe|expanding]].  This expansion is well supported by [[Hubble's law|observations]] and is one of the foundations of the [[Big Bang|Big Bang Model]].  In the late 1990s, observations of [[supernova]]e<ref name=\"ref:Perlmutter\"/> determined that not only is the universe expanding, it is expanding at an increasing rate.  A better understanding of the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]], or [[dark energy]], has become one of the most important questions in cosmology today.  In order to understand the nature of the dark energy, it is important to have a variety of ways of measuring the acceleration.  BAO can add to the body of knowledge about this acceleration by comparing observations of the sound horizon today (using clustering of galaxies) to that of the sound horizon at the time of recombination (using the CMB).<ref name=\"ref:EisensteinAPJ\"/>  Thus BAO provides a measuring stick with which to better understand the nature of the acceleration, completely independent from the [[Dark energy#Supernovae|supernova technique]].\n\n==BAO signal in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey==\n<!--[[File:Sloan BAO Slice.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 3: A slice through the SDSS map of the distribution of galaxies.

The result of compiling the SDSS data is a three-dimensional map of objects in the nearby universe: the SDSS catalog.

To protect his mother's reputation, he leaves home to take ship to India, but is arrested after Lord Bellasis is murdered. He is tried for murder and acquitted but found guilty of theft of a pocket-watch which was given him by Lord Bellasis. Under the alias of Rufus Dawes, he is sentenced to transportation for life.\n\nDawes is shipped to [[Van Diemen's Land]] on the ''Malabar'', which also carries Captain Vickers, who is to become the new commandant of the penal settlement at Macquarie Harbour, his wife Julia and child Sylvia, Julia's maid, Sarah Purfoy and Lieutenant Maurice Frere, During the voyage, Dawes starts to tutor an illiterate young convict boy, known as \u2018Blinker\u2019, in the basics of arithmetic. \n\nLife is brutal for the convicts. Vickers tries to be relatively humane but Frere goes out of his way to be as brutal as possible. Because of his gardening knowledge, learned at the family home, Dawes is assigned to create and maintain a garden around the commandant's house. \n\nDawes is transferred to Port Arthur under Frere's command. As punishment for being involved in an attempt to escape, he is sent into solitary confinement on Grummet rock, a small island off the coast. Dawes manages to escape and is washed up on a beach, where he finds Frere, Mrs Vickers and Sylvia, who have been marooned there by escaped convicts. Dawes plans, and succeeds in building, a boat out of saplings and goat hide.  Frere promises Dawes a pardon if they are saved. Sylvia calls him, \"Good Mr. Dawes\". They take to sea and are rescued by an American vessel, but Frere has Dawes arrested. Sylvia has blocked out all memory of the events and cannot defend Dawes. Mrs. Vickers dies. \n\nSylvia, now a young woman of sixteen, marries Frere, who has lied about the events and painted Dawes as a would-be murderer.\n\nDawes escapes again to see Sylvia, but in her amnesia she is afraid of him. John Rex, another convict, tries to persuade Dawes to join him in an escape. Rex reaches [[Sydney]] and travels on to [[London]] with Sarah, now his wife, where he presents himself as Richard Devine. Lady Ellinor Devine, Richard\u2019s mother, accepts him as her long-lost son.\n\nIn [[Norfolk Island]], by 1846, Reverend James North has been appointed prison chaplain. He is appalled at the horrible punishments inflicted. and also has strong feelings for Sylvia. \n\nJohn Rex leads a life of debauchery, much to the disapproval of Lady Ellinor, and wishes to sell off the family estate. Lady Ellinor's suspicions have reached the point where she attempts to test her alleged son's knowledge of family secrets.\n\nNorth visits Dawes in prison where he has been sentenced to death by Frere; he changes places with him and Dawes takes ship to Sydney without being discovered. He makes his way to the gold diggings at Ballarat, opening a general goods store. But Frere, now posted to Melbourne, tracks him down with the aid of a lawyer. The lawyer proves to be \u2018Blinker\u2019 now well educated, and Frere is shot dead. \n\nDawes travels to his home and is accepted by his Mother. Rex and his wife, now exposed as frauds, vanish into the night. Vickers arrives and hands Dawes a pardon, having personally lobbied on his behalf.

She spent eight years raising the $6.5 million budget, which consisted of private investment. Payne's co producer was Wilton Schiller, an American with extensive TV experience.

Mrs. Vickers dies. \n\nSylvia, now a young woman of sixteen, marries Frere, who has lied about the events and painted Dawes as a would-be murderer.\n\nDawes escapes again to see Sylvia, but in her amnesia she is afraid of him. John Rex, another convict, tries to persuade Dawes to join him in an escape. Rex reaches [[Sydney]] and travels on to [[London]] with Sarah, now his wife, where he presents himself as Richard Devine. Lady Ellinor Devine, Richard\u2019s mother, accepts him as her long-lost son.\n\nIn [[Norfolk Island]], by 1846, Reverend James North has been appointed prison chaplain. He is appalled at the horrible punishments inflicted. and also has strong feelings for Sylvia. \n\nJohn Rex leads a life of debauchery, much to the disapproval of Lady Ellinor, and wishes to sell off the family estate. Lady Ellinor's suspicions have reached the point where she attempts to test her alleged son's knowledge of family secrets.\n\nNorth visits Dawes in prison where he has been sentenced to death by Frere; he changes places with him and Dawes takes ship to Sydney without being discovered. He makes his way to the gold diggings at Ballarat, opening a general goods store. But Frere, now posted to Melbourne, tracks him down with the aid of a lawyer. The lawyer proves to be \u2018Blinker\u2019 now well educated, and Frere is shot dead. \n\nDawes travels to his home and is accepted by his Mother. Rex and his wife, now exposed as frauds, vanish into the night. Vickers arrives and hands Dawes a pardon, having personally lobbied on his behalf. It is assumed that Dawes and Sylvia will now marry.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Rufus Dawes\n* [[Rod Mullinar]] as Lieutenant Frere\n* [[Robert Coleby]] as John Rex\n*Susan Lyons as Sarah Purfoy\n*Penelope Stewart as Sylvia Vickers\u2014As An Adult \n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as Reverend North\n* [[Patrick Macnee]] as Major Vickers\n* [[Samantha Eggar]] as Julie Vickers\n* [[Diane Cilento]] as Lady Ellinor\n*Donald McDonald as Reverend Meekin\n*Johnny Johnstone as Gabbett\n*John Turnbull as Jemmy Vetch\n*[[Rebe Taylor]] as Sylvia Vickers\u2014As A Child\n\n==Production==\nThe mini-series was based on the original serialised version of the novel ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]'', which meant it featured scenes of Rufus Dawes in the [[Australian Gold Rush]] and a happy ending where Dawes is reunited with Sylvia.\n\nThe mini series was a passion project for Patricia Payne, who had wanted to adapt the novel since she read it in high school.

Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are respectively headquartered in [[Irvine, California]], and London.  Sega's arcade division existed as '''Sega Interactive Co., Ltd.''' from 2015 to 2020.  Sega is a subsidiary of '''Sega Group Corporation''', which is in turn a part of [[Sega Sammy Holdings]].  From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed and sold [[video game console]]s.\n\nSega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}} on June 3, 1960. The company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]]. Sega developed its first coin-operated game with ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'' in the late 1960s. In an effort to become a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], Sega was sold to [[Gulf and Western Industries]] in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]], but struggled against competitors such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  In 1984, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] led a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].\n\nSega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. Although it was a distant third in Japan, the Genesis found major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], in the U.S. However, later in the decade, Sega suffered [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] such as the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a [[third-party developer]] and publisher, and was acquired by [[Sammy Corporation]] in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable.  Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, with Sega Corporation being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed to Sega Corporation.\n\nSega produces [[List of best-selling video game franchises|multi-million-selling game franchises]] including ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Total War (video game series)|Total War]]'', and ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]],'' and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates [[amusement arcade]]s and produces other entertainment products, including [[Sega Toys]]. As a company, Sega is retrospectively remembered for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for misguided business decisions and lack of creativity.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Sega}}\n\n===Origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|The Diamond 3 Star, a model of coin-operated slot machines produced by Sega in the 1950s|left|alt=Diamond 3 Star slot machines]]\nIn 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii. Their aim was to provide [[Arcade game|coin-operated amusement machines]], including [[slot machine]]s, to military bases as the increase in personnel with the onset of [[World War II]] would create demand for entertainment.

From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed and sold [[video game console]]s.\n\nSega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}} on June 3, 1960. The company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]]. Sega developed its first coin-operated game with ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'' in the late 1960s. In an effort to become a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], Sega was sold to [[Gulf and Western Industries]] in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]], but struggled against competitors such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  In 1984, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] led a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].\n\nSega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. Although it was a distant third in Japan, the Genesis found major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], in the U.S. However, later in the decade, Sega suffered [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] such as the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a [[third-party developer]] and publisher, and was acquired by [[Sammy Corporation]] in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable.  Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, with Sega Corporation being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed to Sega Corporation.\n\nSega produces [[List of best-selling video game franchises|multi-million-selling game franchises]] including ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Total War (video game series)|Total War]]'', and ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]],'' and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates [[amusement arcade]]s and produces other entertainment products, including [[Sega Toys]]. As a company, Sega is retrospectively remembered for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for misguided business decisions and lack of creativity.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Sega}}\n\n===Origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|The Diamond 3 Star, a model of coin-operated slot machines produced by Sega in the 1950s|left|alt=Diamond 3 Star slot machines]]\nIn 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii. Their aim was to provide [[Arcade game|coin-operated amusement machines]], including [[slot machine]]s, to military bases as the increase in personnel with the onset of [[World War II]] would create demand for entertainment. After the war, the founders sold Standard Games and established Service Games, named for the military focus. After the United States government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1951, Bromley sent employees Richard Stewart and Ray LeMaire to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan to provide coin-operated slot machines to U.S. bases in Japan.<ref name=\"IGN History of Sega\">{{cite web|url=https://ign.com/articles/2009/04/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-sega|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|last1=Fahs|first1=Travis|date=April 21, 2009|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824130011/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-sega|archive-date=August 24, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://kotaku.com/5788468/meet-the-four-americans-who-built-sega|title= Meet the four Americans who built Sega|first= Luke|last= Plunkett|work= [[Kotaku]]|publisher= [[Gawker Media]]|date= April 4, 2011|accessdate= August 1, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150726090220/http://kotaku.com/5788468/meet-the-four-americans-who-built-sega|archive-date= July 26, 2015|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-companies/8578093/IBM-turns-100-other-surprisingly-ancient-technology-companies.html?image=8|title= IBM turns 100: other surprisingly ancient technology companies|work= [[The Guardian]]|publisher= [[Scott Trust Limited]]|accessdate= August 1, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150926071052/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-companies/8578093/IBM-turns-100-other-surprisingly-ancient-technology-companies.html?image=8|archive-date= September 26, 2015|url-status= live|df= mdy-all|date= June 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IfDouSUqOUIC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&f=false|title=Core Techniques and Algorithms in Game Programming|last=S\u00e0nchez-Crespo Delmau|first=Daniel|publisher=New Riders|year=2004|isbn=9780131020092|location=|page=3|access-date=August 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123110659/https://books.google.com/books?id=IfDouSUqOUIC&pg=PA3&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMIgsnbx7mKxwIVhQOOCh2YkAql#v=onepage&f=false|archive-date=November 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> A year later, all five men established Service Games Panama to control the various entities of Service Games worldwide.
