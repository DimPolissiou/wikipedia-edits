After two months, Local 15 members voted on August 31 to return to their jobs. The union made an unconditional offer to return to work while still negotiating an agreement.\n\"Some of the guys were hurting financially, that's why we voted to go back to work,\" said Tom O'Reilly, Ass't Business Manager for Local 15. \"We have no intention of agreeing with the company's current proposal.\" Midwest rejected that offer and locked out all of its workers who honored the picket line at the time IBEW Local 15 made the offer to return. Faced with a lockout, the union accepted Midwest Generation's contract offer and the locked-out employees returned to work nearly seven weeks later under the terms of a new agreement which was less favorable to employees.\n\nImmediately after the company instituted the lockout, IBEW Local 15 filed an unfair labor practice charge with Region 13 claiming that the lockout was unlawful. The case was submitted to the NLRB's Division of Advice and in March 2002, the Regional Director for Region 13 issued a complaint against Midwest Generation. The complaint alleged that the lockout unlawfully targeted employees based on their union activity because the company permitted employees to continue to work during the lockout if they had not struck, or if they had ceased to participate in the strike prior to the union's unconditional offer to return.\n\nThe case was transferred to the NLRB in May 2002 and in September 2004, by a 2\u20131 panel vote, the George Bush-appointed Board[9] found that Midwest Generation had not violated the NLRA. In October 2005, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the Board's decision and remanded the case back to the Board with instructions to find that the lockout violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act because it unlawfully targeted employees based on their union activity. With respect to the remedy, the Seventh Circuit directed the Board to consider whether the lockout coerced the employees into accepting the contract offer, thereby voiding the agreement. In 2006, the Supreme Court declined to hear Midwest Generation's appeal.\n\nIn March 2008, the Board accepted the Seventh Circuit's remand and ordered that the employees who were locked out be made whole for the period of the lockout. In addition, the Board remanded the case to an administrative law judge to consider voiding the contract. In the meantime, Midwest Generation and IBEW Local 15 had successfully negotiated a successor collective bargaining agreement that replaced the contract from the 2001 negotiations.\n\nChief Judge Giannasi oversaw extensive settlement talks that resulted in a global settlement of all issues related to the lockout, including the potential contract voiding issue. The parties worked cooperatively to calculate the losses that employees suffered as a direct result of the lockout. In November 2008, the parties agreed upon approximately $16 million in backpay and other damages, including 401(k)and other reimbursable losses.\n\n===Demolition===\nDemolition of the plant began in 2019.<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a22719\"/><ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a123119\"/> On December 30, 2019, a worker fell to his death, and demolition was halted.<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a123119\"/><ref>Pe\u00f1a, Mauricio. \"[https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/06/demolition-of-crawford-coal-plant-suspended-after-worker-falls-to-his-death/ Demolition Of Crawford Coal Plant Suspended After Worker Falls To His Death]\", ''Book Club Chicago''.

After two months, Local 15 members voted on August 31 to return to their jobs. The union made an unconditional offer to return to work while still negotiating an agreement.\n\"Some of the guys were hurting financially, that's why we voted to go back to work,\" said Tom O'Reilly, Ass't Business Manager for Local 15. \"We have no intention of agreeing with the company's current proposal.\" Midwest rejected that offer and locked out all of its workers who honored the picket line at the time IBEW Local 15 made the offer to return. Faced with a lockout, the union accepted Midwest Generation's contract offer and the locked-out employees returned to work nearly seven weeks later under the terms of a new agreement which was less favorable to employees.\n\nImmediately after the company instituted the lockout, IBEW Local 15 filed an unfair labor practice charge with Region 13 claiming that the lockout was unlawful. The case was submitted to the NLRB's Division of Advice and in March 2002, the Regional Director for Region 13 issued a complaint against Midwest Generation. The complaint alleged that the lockout unlawfully targeted employees based on their union activity because the company permitted employees to continue to work during the lockout if they had not struck, or if they had ceased to participate in the strike prior to the union's unconditional offer to return.\n\nThe case was transferred to the NLRB in May 2002 and in September 2004, by a 2\u20131 panel vote, the George Bush-appointed Board[9] found that Midwest Generation had not violated the NLRA. In October 2005, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the Board's decision and remanded the case back to the Board with instructions to find that the lockout violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act because it unlawfully targeted employees based on their union activity. With respect to the remedy, the Seventh Circuit directed the Board to consider whether the lockout coerced the employees into accepting the contract offer, thereby voiding the agreement. In 2006, the Supreme Court declined to hear Midwest Generation's appeal.\n\nIn March 2008, the Board accepted the Seventh Circuit's remand and ordered that the employees who were locked out be made whole for the period of the lockout. In addition, the Board remanded the case to an administrative law judge to consider voiding the contract. In the meantime, Midwest Generation and IBEW Local 15 had successfully negotiated a successor collective bargaining agreement that replaced the contract from the 2001 negotiations.\n\nChief Judge Giannasi oversaw extensive settlement talks that resulted in a global settlement of all issues related to the lockout, including the potential contract voiding issue. The parties worked cooperatively to calculate the losses that employees suffered as a direct result of the lockout. In November 2008, the parties agreed upon approximately $16 million in backpay and other damages, including 401(k)and other reimbursable losses.\n\n===Demolition===\nDemolition of the plant began in 2019.<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a22719\"/><ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a123119\"/> On December 30, 2019, a worker fell to his death, and demolition was halted.<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a123119\"/><ref>Pe\u00f1a, Mauricio. \"[https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/06/demolition-of-crawford-coal-plant-suspended-after-worker-falls-to-his-death/ Demolition Of Crawford Coal Plant Suspended After Worker Falls To His Death]\", ''Book Club Chicago''.

This Math is located at [[Shirali]] in the [[Bhatkal]] Taluk in North Kanara district of Karnataka and has been there since 1757. The other Maths of this community are located in Gokarna, Karla, [[Mangalore]] and Mallapur. All the Maths have the insignia of the saffron flag as shown right, below.\n\nThe chief deity worshipped in this Math is Shri [[Bhavanishankar]] (shown in the picture right, below) who is a form of [[Shiva]]. The other 6 sanctorums of the temple are of the [[Sam\u0101dhi|Samadhis]] of the previous GuruSwami's of the community. Daily [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is carried out at the shrine of Bhavanishankar as well as the other Swamijis.\n\n{{As of|2016}} Shri Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji has been the head of the Math having ascended the Peetha in February 1997. Shree Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji is the eleventh of this lineage of Gurus which began in 1708.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Chit mat logo.jpg|thumb|Chitrapur Math Logo|alt= Shri Chitrapur Math Logo]]\n[[File:Shirali math sarovar.jpg|right|thumb|Sarovar]]\nSwami Parijnanashram I is believed to be a direct avatar of Shiva himself and he came down from somewhere in the North (probably [[Varanasi]]). Not many details are known about this Swami, since record-keeping within the Math started only in about 1722.\n\nSwami Shankarashram hailed from the Harite family. He was consecrated by Shri Parijnanashram Swami in 1720 (Sharvari Chaitra Sh-15). He attained Mahasamadhi in 1757 (Ananda, Phalgun Sh-5).\n\nAt this point the issue of location of his Samadhi came up, and the Nagarkatti family offered their house in Chitrapur, Shirali for construction of the Samadhi and the Temple, which stands till today.\n\nShri Shankarashram-I had not adopted any disciple which caused some concern as to the continuity of this lineage. The threat of property takeover by the regional authorities loomed large over the Math, and a member of the Pandit family was considered a worthy person for this position. He was ordained Shri Parijnanashram-II. He adopted a disciple from the priestly family of Shukla, assigning him the name of Shri Shankarashram-II, and spent his life in Kollur in Dhyan (intense meditation), though He often visited Shirali. His Samadhi is located to the right of the Main Samadhi at Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali..\n\nThe Samadhi of Swami Shankarashram-II is located in Mallapur.\n\nThe disciple chosen by him hailed from the Talgeri family and was given the name of Shri Keshavashram. He began acquiring land and other agricultural assets for the Math.\n\nSwami Keshavashram ordained a young disciple once again from the Shukla family under the name Shri Vamanashram, who entrusted day-to-day matters of the Math to the priests, who were the managers. He attained Mahasamadhi in [[Mangalore]]. A disciple adopted by him from the Nagarkar family was ordained for [[Sannyasa]] under the title of Shri Krishnashram.\n\nDuring the reign of Shri Krishnashram most of the disciples were brought round from Vaishnava practices, fresh land was purchased and reforms introduced. The [[Temple car|Rath]] Utsava (chariot festival) was started. He was a scholar in [[Sanskrit]] and the shastras. The disciple ordained by him was Shri Pandurangashram.\n\nShri Pandurangashram, of the Nagarkar family, was the eighth [[Sant (religion)|sant]], and reigned for over fifty years. He was ordained into Sanyasa at 12 years of age and was trained under the Guruswami for five years. The greater part of the Math was rebuilt and all the Samadhis of His predecessors were reconstructed with silver under this tutelage. In the village he built a school, a post office and other structures of necessity. He was a scholar of [[Vedic astrology]] and the [[Vedas]]. He attained Mahasamadhi in 1915 A.D.\n\nThe peetha was then ascended by Shri Anandashram Swamiji, who hailed from the Haridas Family was ordained hardly 8 days prior to the Mahasamadhi of Shri Pandurangashram Swamiji. Since his initiation in Sanyasa took place at very early age, he was deprived of being personally guided by the Guruswami. He improved the financial position of the Math, which had dwindled during his early years, by making payments of Vantiga (Donation) almost mandatory. He reigned for 51 years and traveled widely. He attained Mahasamadhi in Bangalore in 1966.\n\n==After 1950==\nA disciple was adopted by Sri Anandashram Swamiji in 1959, once again from the Shuklakar family. His name was [[Parijnanashram III|Sw\u0101mi Parijn\u0101n\u0101shram III]]. The Rathotsava was restarted by him since it had been discontinued by previous Swamis for financial reasons. He collected antiques and artifacts to set up a Museum. He started a school for the handicapped in Bolinj at Virar near Mumbai.\n\n[[Parijnanashram III|Sw\u0101mi Parijn\u0101n\u0101shram III]] attained Mahasamadhi in Bangalore in 1991 and His Samadhi is located at Karla near Lonavla in Maharashtra.

This Math is located at [[Shirali]] in the [[Bhatkal]] Taluk in North Kanara district of Karnataka and has been there since 1757. The other Maths of this community are located in Gokarna, Karla, [[Mangalore]] and Mallapur. All the Maths have the insignia of the saffron flag as shown right, below.\n\nThe chief deity worshipped in this Math is Shri [[Bhavanishankar]] (shown in the picture right, below) who is a form of [[Shiva]]. The other 6 sanctorums of the temple are of the [[Sam\u0101dhi|Samadhis]] of the previous GuruSwami's of the community. Daily [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is carried out at the shrine of Bhavanishankar as well as the other Swamijis.\n\n{{As of|2016}} Shri Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji has been the head of the Math having ascended the Peetha in February 1997. Shree Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji is the eleventh of this lineage of Gurus which began in 1708.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Chit mat logo.jpg|thumb|Chitrapur Math Logo|alt= Shri Chitrapur Math Logo]]\n[[File:Shirali math sarovar.jpg|right|thumb|Sarovar]]\nSwami Parijnanashram I is believed to be a direct avatar of Shiva himself and he came down from somewhere in the North (probably [[Varanasi]]). Not many details are known about this Swami, since record-keeping within the Math started only in about 1722.\n\nSwami Shankarashram hailed from the Harite family. He was consecrated by Shri Parijnanashram Swami in 1720 (Sharvari Chaitra Sh-15). He attained Mahasamadhi in 1757 (Ananda, Phalgun Sh-5).\n\nAt this point the issue of location of his Samadhi came up, and the Nagarkatti family offered their house in Chitrapur, Shirali for construction of the Samadhi and the Temple, which stands till today.\n\nShri Shankarashram-I had not adopted any disciple which caused some concern as to the continuity of this lineage. The threat of property takeover by the regional authorities loomed large over the Math, and a member of the Pandit family was considered a worthy person for this position. He was ordained Shri Parijnanashram-II. He adopted a disciple from the priestly family of Shukla, assigning him the name of Shri Shankarashram-II, and spent his life in Kollur in Dhyan (intense meditation), though He often visited Shirali. His Samadhi is located to the right of the Main Samadhi at Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali..\n\nThe Samadhi of Swami Shankarashram-II is located in Mallapur.\n\nThe disciple chosen by him hailed from the Talgeri family and was given the name of Shri Keshavashram. He began acquiring land and other agricultural assets for the Math.\n\nSwami Keshavashram ordained a young disciple once again from the Shukla family under the name Shri Vamanashram, who entrusted day-to-day matters of the Math to the priests, who were the managers. He attained Mahasamadhi in [[Mangalore]]. A disciple was adopted by him from the Nagarkar family. Hence he was ordained a disciple for [[Sannyasa]] under the title of Shri Krishnashram.\n\nDuring the reign of Shri Krishnashram most of the disciples were brought round from Vaishnava practices, fresh land was purchased and reforms introduced. The [[Temple car|Rath]] Utsava (chariot festival) was started. He was a scholar in [[Sanskrit]] and the shastras. The disciple ordained by him was Shri Pandurangashram.\n\nShri Pandurangashram, of the Nagarkar family, was the eighth [[Sant (religion)|sant]], and reigned for over fifty years. He was ordained into Sanyasa at 12 years of age and was trained under the Guruswami for five years. The greater part of the Math was rebuilt and all the Samadhis of His predecessors were reconstructed with silver under this tutelage. In the village he built a school, a post office and other structures of necessity. He was a scholar of [[Vedic astrology]] and the [[Vedas]]. He attained Mahasamadhi in 1915 A.D.\n\nThe peetha was then ascended by Shri Anandashram Swamiji, who hailed from the Haridas Family was ordained hardly 8 days prior to the Mahasamadhi of Shri Pandurangashram Swamiji. Since his initiation in Sanyasa took place at very early age, he was deprived of being personally guided by the Guruswami. He improved the financial position of the Math, which had dwindled during his early years, by making payments of Vantiga (Donation) almost mandatory. He reigned for 51 years and traveled widely. He attained Mahasamadhi in Bangalore in 1966.\n\n==After 1950==\nA disciple was adopted by Sri Anandashram Swamiji in 1959, once again from the Shuklakar family. His name was [[Parijnanashram III|Sw\u0101mi Parijn\u0101n\u0101shram III]]. The Rathotsava was restarted by him since it had been discontinued by previous Swamis for financial reasons. He collected antiques and artifacts to set up a Museum. He started a school for the handicapped in Bolinj at Virar near Mumbai.\n\n[[Parijnanashram III|Sw\u0101mi Parijn\u0101n\u0101shram III]] attained Mahasamadhi in Bangalore in 1991 and His Samadhi is located at Karla near Lonavla in Maharashtra. The samadhi enclave also contains a temple of Goddess [[Durga Parmeshwari]] and Shree [[Ganesha]] just like the other Swamijis.\n\n== [[Sadyojat Shankarashram|Shree Sadyojat Shankarashram Swami]] ==\n\nThe previous Swamiji had not adopted a disciple (shisya).
