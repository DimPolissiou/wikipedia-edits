After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and the subsequent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion of the [[Morea]] in 1460, Thomas fled to [[Corfu]] with his children Andreas, [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]]. After Thomas died in 1465, the then twelve-year-old Andreas moved to [[Rome]] and, as the eldest nephew of Constantine XI, became the head of the [[Palaiologos]] family and the chief claimant to the ancient imperial throne.\n\nThe [[Papacy]] in Rome officially recognized Andreas as the titular [[Despot of the Morea]], the title held by his father until 1460 (and until 1465 in pretense) and a position Andreas would hold until his own death in 1502. From the 1480s onwards, Andreas also claimed the title ''Imperator Constantinoplitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\"), a title never claimed by his father, and hoped to one day restore the empire of his ancestors. His use of this title was supported by some of the Byzantine refugees who lived in Italy.\n\nIn 1480, Andreas married a Roman woman called Caterina and though some sources allude to the possibility that he had children, possibly sons called Constantine and Fernando and a daughter called Maria, there is no concrete evidence that Andreas left any descendants. As his stay in Rome continued, Andreas fell deeper and deeper into poverty. Although his impoverished situation is often blamed by historians on a supposedly extravagant and irresponsible lifestyle, a more likely explanation is that the pension and funding provided to him by the Papacy was constantly cut back, from an initial 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] a month to just 50 ducats a month near the end of his life, far too little to sustain his household.\n\nAndreas travelled around Europe several times in search for a ruler who could aid him in retaking Constantinople but rallied little support. The Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]], who had conquered [[Constantinople]] in 1453, died in 1481 and his two sons [[Sultan Cem|Cem]] and [[Bayezid II|Bayezid]] fought a civil war over who was to succeed him. Seeing his opportunity, Andreas attempted to organize an expedition in southern Italy during the summer of 1481 with the goal of crossing the [[Adriatic Sea]] and restoring the Byzantine Empire. The expedition was cancelled in the autumn when Bayezid had successfully stabilized his rule. Although he maintained hope of recapturing at least the Morea throughout his life, Andreas never returned to Greece.\n\nDesperate for money, Andreas sold his rights to the Byzantine crown in 1494 to [[Charles VIII of France]], who attempted to organize a [[Crusades|crusade]] against the Turks. The sale was conditional on that Charles, who Andreas hoped to use as a champion against the Turks, would conquer the Morea and grant it to Andreas. When Charles died in 1498, Andreas once again claimed the imperial titles, using them until his death. He died in poverty in Rome in 1502, probably never having received the money due for his sale of the title to Charles VIII. In his will, he granted his titles to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], who never used them.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pinturicchio, liberia piccolomini, 1502-07 circa, Pio II giunge ad Ancona per dare inizio alla crociata 01 (cropped 2).JPG|left|thumb|Early 16th-century fresco depicting [[Pope Pius II]]'s 1464 arrival at [[Ancona]], in the [[Siena Cathedral]]. The prominent figure with a blue robe and hat in the bottom left is Andreas's father, [[Thomas Palaiologos]].]]\nAndreas was born on January 17th, 1453,{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} as the son of [[Thomas Palaiologos]], [[Despot of the Morea]], and [[Catherine Zaccaria]], the daughter of [[Centurione II Zaccaria]], the last [[Prince of Achaea]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}} After his uncle [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], the last [[Byzantine emperor]], died [[Fall of Constantinople|defending]] the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]] on May 29, 1453, Andreas' family continued to live in the [[Morea]] as vassals of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]]. But constant bickering between Thomas, who tried to rally support to take back the Byzantine throne, and his brother [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], who sided with the Ottomans, led to the Sultan invading the Morea in 1460; Andreas and his father escaped to [[Corfu]].{{Sfn|Runciman|1969|p=171ff}} His father Thomas then left the rest of the family to go to Rome, where he was welcomed and provided for by [[Pope Pius II]].{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}} Thomas maintained hope that he would one day recover his lands and when preparations were made for a crusade (which ultimately never took place), Thomas personally rode around Italy to drum up support.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nAlthough Catherine Zaccaria died in August 1462{{Sfn|Trapp|Beyer|p=|Kaplaneres|Leontiadis|1989}} and Thomas summoned the children to Rome shortly thereafter,{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}} Andreas and his younger brother [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] did not choose rejoin their father until a few days before Thomas died in 1465.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} Andreas and his younger siblings Manuel and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]] travelled from Corfu to Rome in 1465 but arrived there after their father had already died. Andreas was 12 years old at the time and Manuel was 10. The children were put in the care of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], who had also fled the Byzantine Empire many years ago. Bessarion provided the education for the children and was also the mastermind behind Zoe's marriage to Duke [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III of Moscow]], which was arranged in June of 1472.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} Andreas continued to stay in Rome by consent of the Pope, who recognised him as the heir of Thomas and the rightful Despot of the Morea. One of Thomas Palaiologos's advisors from [[Patras]], [[George Sphrantzes]], visited Andreas in 1466 and then recognised him as \"the successor and heir of the Palaiologan dynasty\" and his rightful ruler.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n[[File:Bessarion 1476.JPG|thumb|408x408px|Contemporary painting of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], a former Byzantine refugee who took care of the young Andreas and his siblings [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]] until his death in 1472.]]\nInitially, Andreas's seal bore the [[double-headed eagle]] of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] emperors and the title ''Despotes Romeorum'' (\"Despot of the Romans\"). From the 1480s onwards, perhaps in response to feeling as if he was not receiving the respect due to him, Andreas styled himself as the ''Imperator Constantinopolitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\"),{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=552}} a title never adopted by his father.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} Though this title differed from the traditional title used by the Byzantine emperors (\"[[Basileus|Emperor]] and [[Autokrator|Autocrat]] of the Romans\"), it was the traditional designation used for the eastern emperors by western Europeans, in particular the Papacy.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=|pp=61\u201382}} Andreas's upbringing in Rome may have made him unaware that the Byzantine emperors had been formally titled as Emperors of the Romans rather than Emperors of Constantinople.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=552}} Although hereditary succession had never been officially used in the empire,{{Sfn|Karayannopoulous|2000|p=183}} Andreas was recognized as the rightful heir by some of his contemporaries, most prominently Cardinal Bessarion until his death in 1472.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}} Outside of his aspirations of restoring his empire, Andreas's claim to be an emperor was mostly expressed through insisting on various honors, such as insisting that he be allowed to carry the same type of candle as the cardinals during a 1486 procession in the [[Sistine Chapel]].{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=552}}\n\n=== Financial troubles ===\nThe financial troubles which persisted throughout Andreas's life probably began shortly after Cardinal Bessarion's death. By 1475, at the age of 22, Andreas had begun offering to sell his rights to the imperial thrones of both Constantinople and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], writing letters to several rulers, including the King of Naples ([[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand I]]), possibly the Duke of Milan ([[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]]) and the Duke of Burgundy ([[Charles the Bold|Charles]]). By writing to many different rulers, Andreas was probably looking for the highest bidder. Andreas's younger brother Manuel also fell into financial hardship but had no titles to sell as he was second-in-line. Instead, Manuel left Rome to travel around Europe seeking to enter the service of one of Europe's rulers in some military capacity. Receiving no satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone in Rome by travelling to Constantinople and presenting himself before Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him and provided him with a generous pension for the rest of his life.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|pp=539\u2013540}}\n\nThe origin of the financial hardship experienced by the Palaiologoi likely lies with reductions to the pension paid to him by the Papacy.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}} The pension originally paid to their father Thomas had been 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] a month, enlarged by an additonal 200 per month from the cardinals. Although this seems a generous amount, Thomas's courtier George Sphrantzes still complained that it was barely enough since Thomas had to support his household in addition to supporting himself. Although Andreas and Manuel was granted the same pension at first, the money was to be shared between them and extra money stopped being paid by the cardinals, meaning that they in effect received only 150 ducats each per month, instead of the 500 that had been paid to their father.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=543}}\n\nEven then, the situation quickly grew worse after Bessarion's death. For the first three months of 1473, the two brothers only received 690 ducats (instead of the correct 900) and when Manuel left Rome in 1474, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] inexplicably used Manuel's absence as an excuse to cut the full pension in half, paying Andreas 150 ducats a month rather than 300, an arrangement that continued even during Manuel's brief return to the city in 1475. From the late 1470s and onwards, the pension was cut back frequently. Though Andreas recieved 150 ducats in June 1478, he only received 104 in November and several months thereafter on account of the \"many wars\" faced by the Papacy. In 1488 and 1489 Andreas was paid 100 ducats each month, though the actual payment often fell below that. After the ascension of [[Pope Alexander VI]] in August 1492, the pension was lowered to just 50 ducats a month.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=|pp=543\u2013545}}\n\nAndreas's financial situation wasn't improved by the fact that he also had to support his retinue. Though some members of his father's household probably travelled with his sister Zoe to Moscow, those who remained in Rome, such as Manuel Palaiologos (not the same person as his brother), George Pagumenos, Michael Aristoboulos (all recorded as accompanying Andreas to [[Brindisi]] in 1481) and Demetrius Rhaoul Cavaces (who represented Andreas and Manuel at Zoe's wedding) were probably part of Andreas's household. Through his later life, the condition of Andreas's home deteriorated and he became increasingly unable to support his retinue. By the 1480s, the Papacy had become the new patron of some of his presumed companions, such as Theodore Tzamblacon \"of Constantinople\", Catherine Zamplaconissa, Euphrasina Palaeologina, Thomasina Cantacuzene and several Greeks described as \"de Morea\", including a man called Constantine, and the two women Theodorina and Megalia.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=|pp=545\u2013547}}\n\nDuring the time spent in Rome, the majority of his adult life, Andreas lived in a house on the [[Campo Marzio]] in Rome, granted to him by Sixtus IV at the time of Zoe's marriage. His house was probably located right next to the local Church of Sant'Andrea.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}} In 1479, Andreas married Caterina, a woman from Rome.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}} Seeking financial aid, Andreas travelled to Moscow in 1480, visiting his sister Zoe (now called Sophia) to beg for money. Sophia apparently provided generously for him and would later complain that she had no jewels left as she had given them all to her brother.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}}\n\n=== Attempted expedition against the Turks ===\n[[File:OttomanEmpire1481.png|thumb|Map of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its vassal states at the time of Andreas's invasion plans, in 1481.]]\nLike his father Thomas, Andreas did make active attempts at organizing expeditions to retake Constantinople and restore the empire.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} Soon after returning from Russia, in the late summer of 1481, Andreas planned to organize an expedition against the Turks. Andreas travelled to southern Italy, the obvious rallying point for an attack on Greece, and was at [[Foggia]] in October with several of his close companions, where he received financial aid from Ferdinand I, the King of Naples. Despite his plans, Andreas never sailed for Greece but instead spent October and November of 1481 at Brindisi with his close companions and King Ferdinand I.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=|pp=548\u2013549}}\n\nThere were good reasons for cancelling the expedition. 1481 had seemed as the perfect time to strike as the Turks had recently suffered a series of reverses. In August 1480, they had been repulsed with heavy losses in the [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|Siege of Rhodes]] and Mehmed II's death on the 3rd of May had been followed by a civil war between his sons [[Sultan Cem|Cem]] and [[Bayezid II|Bayezid]] over who was to seize power. Andreas may have hoped to take part in an counter-attack against the Ottomans led by Ferdinand I (who was at the time being attacked by the Ottomans at [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|Otranto]]). By October, the situation had grown unfavorable and Bayezid was well-established as Sultan and the major Christian realms of Western Europe were too disunited to make use of their recent string of victories. More critically, Andreas's efforts were underfunded. Later historians, following the writings of contemporary writer Gherardi da Volterra, have alleged that Pope Sixtus IV gave Andreas 3000 ducats with which to finance the expedition and though the sum was paid to Andreas in September 1481, there is no evidence to suggest it was for a war in Greece. It is more likely that the money was simply an advance payment for his travels in southern Italy as it didn't cover any extra costs outside the regular expenditure of Andreas and his household.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=549\u2013550}}\n\nAnother reason why the expedition never set out might have been the reluctance of the [[Republic of Venice]] to aid Andreas. Andreas's small force would likely not have been capable of crossing the [[Adriatic Sea]] without aid from Venice, but Venice was reluctant to fight the Ottomans more or less alone. Furthermore, the ''[[Signoria of Venice|signoria]]'' (supreme governing body) of Venice had recently signed a treaty with the Ottomans and disapproved of any ongoing anti-Ottoman activities.{{Sfn|Housley|2017|p=}} Andreas did make at least one further attempt at recapturing the Morea, becoming involved in a 1485 plot to seize [[Monemvasia]] from the Venetians.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=553}}\n\n=== Travels and sale of the imperial title ===\n{{See also|Italian War of 1494\u20131498}}\n[[File:Charles VIII Ecole Francaise 16th century Musee de Conde Chantilly.jpg|left|thumb|Contemporary painting of [[Charles VIII of France]], who secured Andreas's claims to the imperial thrones of [[Byzantine Empire|Constantinople]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] in 1494 through the machinations of the French cardinal [[Raymond Peraudi]]. Charles made, ultimately unrealized, plans to conquer Constantinople and the rest of the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s former territory from Sultan [[Bayezid II]].]]\nAndreas left Rome to travel to Moscow once more in 1490, accompanied by Moscow's ambassadors to Rome, Demetrius and Manuel Rhalles. For unknown reasons, Andreas appears to have not been welcome in Moscow and he instead chose to travel to France, where he was generously received by King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], who paid for all of his travel expenses after Andreas gifted him a white falcon.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=550\u2013551}} Andreas stayed with the king at [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] and [[Tours]] from October to December and received additional money, amounting to 350 [[Livre tournois|livres]], before he returned to Rome.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}} In 1492, Andreas was in England, where King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] was not as hospitable as Charles VIII, simply instructing his treasurer, Lord Dynham, to pay Andreas with an amount he thought appropriate and then give him safe conduct out of the country. Andreas's European tour in search for aid for his cause was similar to the one conducted by his grandfather, Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], who travelled Europe from 1399 to 1402 in the hope of securing aid against the Ottomans.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=550\u2013551}}\n\nIn the 1490s, King Charles VIII of France was actively planning a crusade against the Ottomans but he was also involved in a struggle to gain control of the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy. The French cardinal [[Raymond Peraudi]] was passionately devoted to Charles's crusading plans but was against him getting embroiled in Italian politics, believing that war against Naples would prove a fatal diversion of the plans to attack the Turks. French soldiers were already marching into northern Italy on their way to Naples when Peraudi, hoping to divert them to the East before conflict with Naples, began engineering a plan (apparently without the king's knowledge) to give Charles a formal claim on the Byzantine throne.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=461}}\n\nNegotiating with Andreas, Peraudi secured that in return for Andreas abdicating his titles to the imperial thrones of Constantinople and Trebizond, and the [[Despotate of Serbia]], Andreas was to receive 4300 ducats (almost 360 ducats a month), out of which 2000 ducats were to be paid immediately when the abdication was ratified.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=551\u2013550}} Additionally, Andreas was promised a personal guard of a hundred cavalrymen, maintained at Charles's expense, and was promised lands either in Italy or in some other place which in addition to his pension would generate an annual income of 5000 ducats. Furthermore, Charles was to use his military and naval forces to recover the Despotate of the Morea for Andreas and in return for being granted his ancestral lands (once he had been restored in the Morea), Andreas feudal tax to Charles would consist of one white saddle horse every year. Charles was also to use his influence with the Pope to raise Andreas's papal pension to its original sum of 1800 ducats annually (150 monthly). The transfer of Andreas's titles was to be considered legal unless Charles rejected it before 1 November 1495 ([[All Saints' Day]] the following year).{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=545, 551\u2013552}}\n\nAlthough most of what Andreas was to secure from the deal was financial in nature, the agreement was not an irresponsible abdication simply for the sake of easing Andreas's financial situation. Although Andreas explicitly kept for himself the title of Despot of the Morea and made Charles promise to grant Andreas the Morea if he were to be victorious against the Ottomans. In essence, Andreas hoped to use Charles as a powerful champion against the Turks, just as he had hoped to use Ferdinand of Naples thirteen years earlier.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=551\u2013552}}\n[[File:French troops and artillery entering Naples 1495.jpg|thumb|The French troops and artillery of [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] entering [[Naples]] in 1495. From the manuscript MS 801 of the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] manuscripts collection ({{Circa|}} 1498).]]\nThe documents of Andreas's abdication were prepared by Francesco de Schracten of Florence, a pontifical and imperial notary, and Camillo Beninbene, also a notary and a doctor of canon and civil law, on 6 November 1494 in the Church of [[San Pietro in Montorio]], and in addition to Andreas and Peraudi, the affair was also witnessed by five clergymen.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}} Though Charles may still have been unaware of being granted the titles in November, [[Pope Alexander VI]] was probably very aware, since Andreas was provided for by him and Peraudi was a cardinal. The plan was perfect for Alexander VI, who like Peraudi hoped that the French armies marching through Italy were intended to be used against the Ottomans in the defense of Christendom and not against Naples. If the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], was to object to the sudden presence of another emperor in Western Europe, the Pope could simply point out that Andreas's abdication had not been papally sanctioned and that Peraudi had acted improperly on his own initiative.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=463}} Charles VIII's Italian campaigned caused some concern in Constantinople, and Bayezid began building up his defences, constructing new ships and artillery and redirecting his military forces to defensive positions throughout Greece and the lands surrounding Constantinople.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=464}}\n\nCharles eventually accepted the conditions of Andreas's abdications but did not divert from Naples. Though he considered declaring a crusade already while staying at [[Asti]] in northern Italy, he decided that he would only venture eastwards after he had conquered Naples,{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=463}} mainly due to the increased number of attack plans possible if Naples was under his control.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=468}} Charles's efforts were delayed as the king became embroiled in a conflict with the Papacy and states throughout Italy, but on 27 January 1495 he secured possession of Cem Sultan, Bayezid's brother and a rival claimant to the Ottoman throne, formerly in Papal captivity. Alexander VI even offered to personally crown him as the Emperor of Constantinople, but Charles refused, preferring to conquer the eastern empire before formally being crowned emperor.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=476}} On 22 February, Charles triumphantly entered Naples (supposedly wearing a imperial crown){{Sfn|Giesey|1960|p=118}} but three days later he was faced with a great loss through the death of Cem Sultan. Plans around the projected crusade had often revolved around the part Cem was expected to play. Though his army was still intact, Cem's death, combined with a league being formed against Charles VIII, brought with it a gradual abandonment of the crusading plans.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=482}}\n\nAlthough nothing ultimately came of the sale of the title, Charles had legitimately entertained the idea of attempting to conquer Constantinople from Sultan Bayezid II.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=552}}{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=468}} Hopes for a French invasion of the Ottoman Empire ended when Charles died in 1498.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=551\u2013552}} Though Andreas once more claimed his titles after 1498, the French kings after Charles VIII; [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], also continued to use imperial titles and honors. Not until [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] in 1566 did the imperial claim come to an eventual end through the rules of [[extinctive prescription]] as a direct result of desuetude, or lack of use. Charles IX wrote that the imperial Byzantine title \"is not more eminent than that of king, which sounds better and sweeter\".{{Sfn|Potter|1995|p=33}}\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nAndreas remained an active figure in Rome until his death. On 11 March 1501, Andreas prominently partook in the ceremonial entry of an ambassador from [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] into the city.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=553}}\n\nAndreas eventually died poor in Rome at some point in June 1502. In his will, written on 7 April that same year, he once more gave away his claim to the imperial title, this time to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] (neither of whom actually used the titles).{{Sfn|Enepekides|1960|p=|pp=138\u2013143}} His widow Caterina was given 104 ducats by Pope [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] to pay the costs of his funeral.{{Sfn|Runciman|1969|p=184}} He was buried with honour in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], next to his father Thomas.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} Since Andreas and Thomas were buried in Rome, their graves survived the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule,{{Sfn|Melvani|2018|p=260}} but modern efforts to locate their graves within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\n== Possible descendants ==\nAndreas is commonly believed to not have left any descendants. According to [[Donald Nicol]] in ''The Immortal Emperor'' (1992), it is possible that a Constantine Palaiologos who was employed in the Papal Guard in 1508 was a son of Andreas. Russian sources accord Andreas a daughter by the name Maria Palaiologina, unmentioned in western sources, who was married off to the Russian noble Prince Vasily Mihailovi\u0107 by her aunt (Andreas's sister) Sophia.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}} On 17 July 1499, [[Ludovico Sforza]], the Duke of Milan, reported that he had sent \"Don Fernando, son of the Despot of the Morea, nephew of the lord Constantine [Arianiti, governor of Montferrat], to the Turk with five horses\",{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=513}} possibly a diplomatic or espionage mission. This Fernando might have been another son of Andreas and though he did adopt the title Despot of the Morea after Andreas's death, he appears to have made relatively little impact on history, either because he was unwilling to play a prominent role or because he might possibly have been illegitimate, which would have hampered him.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=651}} The [[Constantine Komnenos Arianites|Constantine Arianiti]] referenced by Sforza, genealogically unconnected to Andreas, also claimed the title of Despot of the Morea a few months after Andreas's death.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=653}} [[Theodore Palaiologos (16th century)|Theodore Paleologus]], who lived in Cornwall in the 17th century and claimed descent from Thomas Palaiologos through an otherwise unattested son called John, might be a descendant of Andreas instead, but his lineage is highly uncertain.{{Sfn|Hall|2015|p=229}}\n\n== Legacy and analysis ==\n\n=== Negative portrayal by historians ===\n[[File:Facial Chronicle - b.17, p. 110.gif|thumb|16th century depiction in a Russian chronicle of Andreas's (the standing crowned figure in the center) visit to his sister [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]] (now called Sophia, shown in the window above the enthroned figure, [[Ivan III of Russia]]) in [[Moscow]].|alt=]]\nLater historians have overwhelmingly seen Andreas in a negative light. Scottish historian [[George Finlay]] wrote in 1877 of the fate of Andreas that it \"hardly merits the attention of history, were it not that mankind has a morbid curiosity concerning the fortunes of the most worthless princes\". According to the English historian [[Jonathan Harris (historian)|Jonathan Harris]], who in 1995 offered a more redeeming view of Andreas, he is typically characterized as \"an immoral and extravagant playboy who squandered his generous papal pension on loose living and eventually died in poverty\". Contrary to his typical portrayal, which he considered \"by no means entirely fair\", Harris believed that it would be wrong to dismiss Andreas as a footnote in history.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537}} \n\nAndreas's reputation might partly have been negatively impacted by the actions of his father Thomas, whose warring with his brother Demetrios (Andreas's uncle) allowed the Ottomans to conquer the Morea. The feud between his father and uncle had nothing to do with Andreas, who was just seven years old at the time he and his family fled into exile.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} The financial situation of the Palaiologoi in the 1470s to 1490s must have been considerably bad for Andreas to sell his inherited titles and for Manuel to travel Europe in hopes of employment and eventually travel to the Ottomans in Constantinople. Only a single contemporary author and an author of the generation following the two brothers placed the blame of their financial hardships on Andreas. Writing in 1538, Theodore Spandugnino claimed that Andreas's brother Manuel was better in every possible way and writing in 1481, Gherardi da Volterra stated that Andreas's poor financial situation was due to his excessive indulging in \"lovemaking and pleasures\".{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=540}} This negative assessment was echoed by a vast number of modern historians, but has very little basis.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}}\n\nTo further paint Andreas negatively, virtually every modern account of his life mentions his 1479 marriage to Caterina,{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}} who is often cast in a particularly negative light. Historian [[Steven Runciman]] famously described her as \"a lady from the streets of Rome\" and she is typically identified as a prostitute.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}}{{Sfn|Hall|2015|p=229}} In addition to his financial ruin, marrying a prostitute is another point often used against Andreas. She is known from only a single source, the ''[[Introitus et Exitus]]'' books of the [[Apostolic Camera]], which mentions only her first name, meaning that her profession and social standing are actually unknown. Not even the contemporary critics of Andreas, da Volterra and Gherardi, mention her. The earliest reference to Caterina's \"bad character\" are from the works of the 17th-century Byzantinist [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange]], meaning that tales of Caterina have to be considered unsubstantiated oral tradition. The idea forwarded by Byzantinist [[Dionysios Zakythinos]] in his 20th-century work ''Le despotat grec de Mor\u00e9e (1262\u20131460)'' that Andreas's marriage to the \"prostitute\" Caterina was the cause of the Papacy cutting back his pension is demonstrably false; Pope Sixtus IV even paid Andreas two years worth of his pension in advance in 1479, presumably to cover the expenses of Andreas's journey to Moscow.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}}\n\nAlthough it is possible that Andreas did live an extravagant life, the more likely root cause for his poverty is the constant reductions to the pension paid to him by the Papacy. Though the Popes had been generous to the Palaiologoi on the face of it, providing housing and money, they were not as generous as some historians have claimed. The Popes themselves are partly responsible for propagating this idea. For instance, Sixtus IV recorded his own generosity towards the Palaiologoi by writing of his deeds on the frescoes of the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]]. One of the frescoes depicts Sixtus IV with a grateful Andreas, kneeling at his feet.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}} Andreas didn't, as usually stated, waste any enormous sums of Papal money; the monthly 300 ducat pension originally provided to his father Thomas had shrunken to only 50 ducats by 1492.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=545}}\n\nAndreas's attempted 1481 expedition against the Ottomans has mostly been discarded by historians as more evidence of his incompetence. Some modern historians have gone so far as to claim that Andreas \"squandered\" the money donated by the Pope and used it for \"other purposes\".{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=549}} Though the expedition ultimately never happened, there is no reason to believe that Andreas wasn't serious about it. On 15 September 1481, Sixtus IV had written to bishops in Italy to do \"everything in their power\" to aid Andreas's crossing of the Adriatic Sea. The fact that Andreas actually travelled to Brindisi also suggests that he was hoping to actually lead an expedition to restore the empire. One of the companions that had been hired by Andreas was Crocondilo Clada, a Greek soldier who had led an unsuccessful revolt in the Morea in 1480. Clada would have been an ideal guide if Andreas had successfully landed in Greece. Despite the campaign failing to materialize, the preperations conducted does demonstrate that Andreas did not spend his time in Rome solely in the pursuit of pleasure.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=550}}\n\nAlthough he did die poor, a common assertion is that Andreas died without any money at all. This information usually derives from the fact that Andreas's widow, Caterina, was given money by Pope Alexander VI so that she could pay for the funeral. However, such donations weren't rare or necessarily an indication of poverty. The 1487 funeral of another royal exile, Queen [[Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus|Charlotte of Cyprus]], was also paid for by the Papacy and there are no records of her being described as extravagant or impoverished. Andreas was buried with honour in the St. Peter's Basilica, suggesting that he had at least retained a certain status.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}}\n\n=== Failure of Palaiologan policy ===\n[[File:Sketches of John VIII Palaiologos during his visit at the council of Florence in 1438 by Pisanello.jpg|thumb|Sketches of Andreas's uncle, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], during his visit at the [[Council of Florence]] in 1438, by [[Pisanello]]]]\nHarris considered the exile of Andreas in Rome as the continuation, and ultimate failure, of a policy pursued by the Palaiologoi for over a century.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537}} Since the middle of the 14th century, the Byzantine emperors had looked to Western Europe and the Papacy in the hope of secure help to save their empire from the Turks. Inspired by the writings of west-oriented intellectuals such as [[Demetrios Kydones]] and [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], the Palaiologan emperors belived that if they could only convince the Popes of their religious orthodoxy, the Papacy would unleash large western armies to relieve them.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=547}} This conviction inspired Andreas's great-grandfather [[John V Palaiologos]] to travel to Rome and personally submit to the Pope in 1369 and his uncle [[John VIII Palaiologos]] to attend the 1438\u20131439 [[Council of Florence]] where a union of the churches was proclaimed. Constantine XI had sent desperate appeals for help to the Pope in 1452 when the Ottomans were closing in on Constantinople. The ultimate plan of securing Papal aid for a grand reconquest and restoration continued, unsuccessfully as before, through Thomas and Andreas.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=548}}\n\nUltimately, Andreas's life wasn't a great success and his dreams of restoring of the Byzantine Empire were dashed by constantly having to see to raising the necessary funds to support himself and his household. His difficult situation was not his own fault, and though the degradation of Papal support is the most direct cause for his hardships, the fault ultimately was in the Palaiologan policy of looking to the west for aid itself. The emperors had adopted this policy since their situation in the 14th and 15th centuries offered little other options and they clung to it even though little aid ever arrived, despite many promises. The fact that the west was ultimately powerless to aid Byzantium was a factor in the empire's downfall and ensured that Andreas never returned to his homeland.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pretenders to the Byzantine throne]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite journal|last=Enepekides|first=P.

({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}}; 17 January 1453 \u2013 June 1502), sometimes anglicized to '''Andrew''', was the eldest son of [[Thomas Palaiologos]], a brother of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], the final [[Byzantine emperor]]. After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and the subsequent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion of the [[Morea]] in 1460, Thomas fled to [[Corfu]] with his children Andreas, [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]]. After Thomas died in 1465, the then twelve-year-old Andreas moved to [[Rome]] and, as the eldest nephew of Constantine XI, became the head of the [[Palaiologos]] family and the chief claimant to the ancient imperial throne.\n\nThe [[Papacy]] in Rome officially recognized Andreas as the titular [[Despot of the Morea]], the title held by his father until 1460 (and until 1465 in pretense) and a position Andreas would hold until his own death in 1502. From the 1480s onwards, Andreas also claimed the title ''Imperator Constantinoplitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\"), a title never claimed by his father, and hoped to one day restore the empire of his ancestors. His use of this title was supported by some of the Byzantine refugees who lived in Italy.\n\nIn 1480, Andreas married a Roman woman called Caterina and though some sources allude to the possibility that he had children, possibly sons called Constantine and Fernando and a daughter called Maria, there is no concrete evidence that Andreas left any descendants. As his stay in Rome continued, Andreas fell deeper and deeper into poverty. Although his impoverished situation is often blamed by historians on a supposedly extravagant and irresponsible lifestyle, a more likely explanation is that the pension and funding provided to him by the Papacy was constantly cut back, from an initial 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] a month to just 50 ducats a month near the end of his life, far too little to sustain his household.\n\nAndreas travelled around Europe several times in search for a ruler who could aid him in retaking Constantinople but rallied little support. The Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]], who had conquered [[Constantinople]] in 1453, died in 1481 and his two sons [[Sultan Cem|Cem]] and [[Bayezid II|Bayezid]] fought a civil war over who was to succeed him. Seeing his opportunity, Andreas attempted to organize an expedition in southern Italy during the summer of 1481 with the goal of crossing the [[Adriatic Sea]] and restoring the Byzantine Empire. The expedition was cancelled in the autumn when Bayezid had successfully stabilized his rule. Although he maintained hope of recapturing at least the Morea throughout his life, Andreas never returned to Greece.\n\nDesperate for money, Andreas sold his rights to the Byzantine crown in 1494 to [[Charles VIII of France]], who attempted to organize a [[Crusades|crusade]] against the Turks. The sale was conditional on that Charles, who Andreas hoped to use as a champion against the Turks, would conquer the Morea and grant it to Andreas. When Charles died in 1498, Andreas once again claimed the imperial titles, using them until his death. He died in poverty in Rome in 1502, probably never having received the money due for his sale of the title to Charles VIII. In his will, he granted his titles to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], who never used them.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pinturicchio, liberia piccolomini, 1502-07 circa, Pio II giunge ad Ancona per dare inizio alla crociata 01 (cropped 2).JPG|left|thumb|Early 16th-century fresco depicting [[Pope Pius II]]'s 1464 arrival at [[Ancona]], in the [[Siena Cathedral]].

But constant bickering between Thomas, who tried to rally support to take back the Byzantine throne, and his brother [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], who sided with the Ottomans, led to the Sultan invading the Morea in 1460; Andreas and his father escaped to [[Corfu]].{{Sfn|Runciman|1969|p=171ff}} His father Thomas then left the rest of the family to go to Rome, where he was welcomed and provided for by [[Pope Pius II]].{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}} Thomas maintained hope that he would one day recover his lands and when preparations were made for a crusade (which ultimately never took place), Thomas personally rode around Italy to drum up support.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nAlthough Catherine Zaccaria died in August 1462{{Sfn|Trapp|Beyer|p=|Kaplaneres|Leontiadis|1989}} and Thomas summoned the children to Rome shortly thereafter,{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}} Andreas and his younger brother [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] did not choose rejoin their father until a few days before Thomas died in 1465.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} Andreas and his younger siblings Manuel and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]] travelled from Corfu to Rome in 1465 but arrived there after their father had already died. Andreas was 12 years old at the time and Manuel was 10. The children were put in the care of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], who had also fled the Byzantine Empire many years ago. Bessarion provided the education for the children and was also the mastermind behind Zoe's marriage to Duke [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III of Moscow]], which was arranged in June of 1472.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} Andreas continued to stay in Rome by consent of the Pope, who recognised him as the heir of Thomas and the rightful Despot of the Morea. One of Thomas Palaiologos's advisors from [[Patras]], [[George Sphrantzes]], visited Andreas in 1466 and then recognised him as \"the successor and heir of the Palaiologan dynasty\" and his rightful ruler.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n[[File:Bessarion 1476.JPG|thumb|408x408px|Contemporary painting of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], a former Byzantine refugee who took care of the young Andreas and his siblings [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]] until his death in 1472.]]\nInitially, Andreas's seal bore the [[double-headed eagle]] of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] emperors and the title ''Despotes Romeorum'' (\"Despot of the Romans\"). From the 1480s onwards, perhaps in response to feeling as if he was not receiving the respect due to him, Andreas styled himself as the ''Imperator Constantinopolitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\"),{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=552}} a title never adopted by his father.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} Though this title differed from the traditional title used by the Byzantine emperors (\"[[Basileus|Emperor]] and [[Autokrator|Autocrat]] of the Romans\"), it was the traditional designation used for the eastern emperors by western Europeans, in particular the Papacy.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=|pp=61\u201382}} Andreas's upbringing in Rome may have made him unaware that the Byzantine emperors had been formally titled as Emperors of the Romans rather than Emperors of Constantinople.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=552}} Although hereditary succession had never been officially used in the empire,{{Sfn|Karayannopoulous|2000|p=183}} Andreas was recognized as the rightful heir by some of his contemporaries, most prominently Cardinal Bessarion until his death in 1472.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}} Outside of his aspirations of restoring his empire, Andreas's claim to be an emperor was mostly expressed through insisting on various honors, such as insisting that he be allowed to carry the same type of candle as the cardinals during a 1486 procession in the [[Sistine Chapel]].{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=552}}\n\n=== Financial troubles ===\nThe financial troubles which persisted throughout Andreas's life probably began shortly after Cardinal Bessarion's death. By 1475, at the age of 22, Andreas had begun offering to sell his rights to the imperial thrones of both Constantinople and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], writing letters to several rulers, including the King of Naples ([[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand I]]), possibly the Duke of Milan ([[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]]) and the Duke of Burgundy ([[Charles the Bold|Charles]]). By writing to many different rulers, Andreas was probably looking for the highest bidder. Andreas's younger brother Manuel also fell into financial hardship but had no titles to sell as he was second-in-line. Instead, Manuel left Rome to travel around Europe seeking to enter the service of one of Europe's rulers in some military capacity. Receiving no satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone in Rome by travelling to Constantinople and presenting himself before Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him and provided him with a generous pension for the rest of his life.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|pp=539\u2013540}}\n\nThe origin of the financial hardship experienced by the Palaiologoi likely lies with reductions to the pension paid to him by the Papacy.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}} The pension originally paid to their father Thomas had been 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] a month, enlarged by an additonal 200 per month from the cardinals. Although this seems a generous amount, Thomas's courtier George Sphrantzes still complained that it was barely enough since Thomas had to support his household in addition to supporting himself. Although Andreas and Manuel was granted the same pension at first, the money was to be shared between them and extra money stopped being paid by the cardinals, meaning that they in effect received only 150 ducats each per month, instead of the 500 that had been paid to their father.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=543}}\n\nEven then, the situation quickly grew worse after Bessarion's death. For the first three months of 1473, the two brothers only received 690 ducats (instead of the correct 900) and when Manuel left Rome in 1474, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] inexplicably used Manuel's absence as an excuse to cut the full pension in half, paying Andreas 150 ducats a month rather than 300, an arrangement that continued even during Manuel's brief return to the city in 1475. From the late 1470s and onwards, the pension was cut back frequently. Though Andreas recieved 150 ducats in June 1478, he only received 104 in November and several months thereafter on account of the \"many wars\" faced by the Papacy. In 1488 and 1489 Andreas was paid 100 ducats each month, though the actual payment often fell below that. After the ascension of [[Pope Alexander VI]] in August 1492, the pension was lowered to just 50 ducats a month.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=|pp=543\u2013545}}\n\nAndreas's financial situation wasn't improved by the fact that he also had to support his retinue. Though some members of his father's household probably travelled with his sister Zoe to Moscow, those who remained in Rome, such as Manuel Palaiologos (not the same person as his brother), George Pagumenos, Michael Aristoboulos (all recorded as accompanying Andreas to [[Brindisi]] in 1481) and Demetrius Rhaoul Cavaces (who represented Andreas and Manuel at Zoe's wedding) were probably part of Andreas's household. Through his later life, the condition of Andreas's home deteriorated and he became increasingly unable to support his retinue. By the 1480s, the Papacy had become the new patron of some of his presumed companions, such as Theodore Tzamblacon \"of Constantinople\", Catherine Zamplaconissa, Euphrasina Palaeologina, Thomasina Cantacuzene and several Greeks described as \"de Morea\", including a man called Constantine, and the two women Theodorina and Megalia.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=|pp=545\u2013547}}\n\nDuring the time spent in Rome, the majority of his adult life, Andreas lived in a house on the [[Campo Marzio]] in Rome, granted to him by Sixtus IV at the time of Zoe's marriage. His house was probably located right next to the local Church of Sant'Andrea.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}} In 1479, Andreas married Caterina, a woman from Rome.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}} Seeking financial aid, Andreas travelled to Moscow in 1480, visiting his sister Zoe (now called Sophia) to beg for money. Sophia apparently provided generously for him and would later complain that she had no jewels left as she had given them all to her brother.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}}\n\n=== Attempted expedition against the Turks ===\n[[File:OttomanEmpire1481.png|thumb|Map of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its vassal states at the time of Andreas's invasion plans, in 1481.]]\nLike his father Thomas, Andreas did make active attempts at organizing expeditions to retake Constantinople and restore the empire.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} Soon after returning from Russia, in the late summer of 1481, Andreas planned to organize an expedition against the Turks. Andreas travelled to southern Italy, the obvious rallying point for an attack on Greece, and was at [[Foggia]] in October with several of his close companions, where he received financial aid from Ferdinand I, the King of Naples. Despite his plans, Andreas never sailed for Greece but instead spent October and November of 1481 at Brindisi with his close companions and King Ferdinand I.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=|pp=548\u2013549}}\n\nThere were good reasons for cancelling the expedition. 1481 had seemed as the perfect time to strike as the Turks had recently suffered a series of reverses. In August 1480, they had been repulsed with heavy losses in the [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|Siege of Rhodes]] and Mehmed II's death on the 3rd of May had been followed by a civil war between his sons [[Sultan Cem|Cem]] and [[Bayezid II|Bayezid]] over who was to seize power. Andreas may have hoped to take part in an counter-attack against the Ottomans led by Ferdinand I (who was at the time being attacked by the Ottomans at [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|Otranto]]). By October, the situation had grown unfavorable and Bayezid was well-established as Sultan and the major Christian realms of Western Europe were too disunited to make use of their recent string of victories. More critically, Andreas's efforts were underfunded. Later historians, following the writings of contemporary writer Gherardi da Volterra, have alleged that Pope Sixtus IV gave Andreas 3000 ducats with which to finance the expedition and though the sum was paid to Andreas in September 1481, there is no evidence to suggest it was for a war in Greece. It is more likely that the money was simply an advance payment for his travels in southern Italy as it didn't cover any extra costs outside the regular expenditure of Andreas and his household.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=549\u2013550}}\n\nAnother reason why the expedition never set out might have been the reluctance of the [[Republic of Venice]] to aid Andreas. Andreas's small force would likely not have been capable of crossing the [[Adriatic Sea]] without aid from Venice, but Venice was reluctant to fight the Ottomans more or less alone. Furthermore, the ''[[Signoria of Venice|signoria]]'' (supreme governing body) of Venice had recently signed a treaty with the Ottomans and disapproved of any ongoing anti-Ottoman activities.{{Sfn|Housley|2017|p=}} Andreas did make at least one further attempt at recapturing the Morea, becoming involved in a 1485 plot to seize [[Monemvasia]] from the Venetians.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=553}}\n\n=== Travels and sale of the imperial title ===\n{{See also|Italian War of 1494\u20131498}}\n[[File:Charles VIII Ecole Francaise 16th century Musee de Conde Chantilly.jpg|left|thumb|Contemporary painting of [[Charles VIII of France]], who secured Andreas's claims to the imperial thrones of [[Byzantine Empire|Constantinople]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] in 1494 through the machinations of the French cardinal [[Raymond Peraudi]]. Chales made, ultimately unrealized, plans to conquer Constantinople and the rest of the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s former territory from Sultan [[Bayezid II]].]]\nAndreas left Rome to travel to Moscow once more in 1490, accompanied by Moscow's ambassadors to Rome, Demetrius and Manuel Rhalles. For unknown reasons, Andreas appears to have not been welcome in Moscow and he instead chose to travel to France, where he was generously received by King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], who paid for all of his travel expenses after Andreas gifted him a white falcon.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=550\u2013551}} Andreas stayed with the king at [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] and [[Tours]] from October to December and received additional money, amounting to 350 [[Livre tournois|livres]], before he returned to Rome.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}} In 1492, Andreas was in England, where King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] was not as hospitable as Charles VIII, simply instructing his treasurer, Lord Dynham, to pay Andreas with an amount he thought appropriate and then give him safe conduct out of the country. Andreas's European tour in search for aid for his cause was similar to the one conducted by his grandfather, Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], who travelled Europe from 1399 to 1402 in the hope of securing aid against the Ottomans.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=550\u2013551}}\n\nIn the 1490s, King Charles VIII of France was actively planning a crusade against the Ottomans but he was also involved in a struggle to gain control of the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy. The French cardinal [[Raymond Peraudi]] was passionately devoted to Charles's crusading plans but was against him getting embroiled in Italian politics, believing that war against Naples would prove a fatal diversion of the plans to attack the Turks. French soldiers were already marching into northern Italy on their way to Naples when Peraudi, hoping to divert them to the East before conflict with Naples, began engineering a plan (apparently without the king's knowledge) to give Charles a formal claim on the Byzantine throne.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=461}}\n\nNegotiating with Andreas, Peraudi secured that in return for Andreas abdicating his titles to the imperial thrones of Constantinople and Trebizond, and the [[Despotate of Serbia]], Andreas was to receive 4300 ducats (almost 360 ducats a month), out of which 2000 ducats were to be paid immediately when the abdication was ratified.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=551\u2013550}} Additionally, Andreas was promised a personal guard of a hundred cavalrymen, maintained at Charles's expense, and was promised lands either in Italy or in some other place which in addition to his pension would generate an annual income of 5000 ducats. Furthermore, Charles was to use his military and naval forces to recover the Despotate of the Morea for Andreas and in return for being granted his ancestral lands (once he had been restored in the Morea), Andreas feudal tax to Charles would consist of one white saddle horse every year. Charles was also to use his influence with the Pope to raise Andreas's papal pension to its original sum of 1800 ducats annually (150 monthly). The transfer of Andreas's titles was to be considered legal unless Charles rejected it before 1 November 1495 ([[All Saints' Day]] the following year).{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=545, 551\u2013552}}\n\nAlthough most of what Andreas was to secure from the deal was financial in nature, the agreement was not an irresponsible abdication simply for the sake of easing Andreas's financial situation. Although Andreas explicitly kept for himself the title of Despot of the Morea and made Charles promise to grant Andreas the Morea if he were to be victorious against the Ottomans. In essence, Andreas hoped to use Charles as a powerful champion against the Turks, just as he had hoped to use Ferdinand of Naples thirteen years earlier.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=551\u2013552}}\n[[File:French troops and artillery entering Naples 1495.jpg|thumb|The French troops and artillery of [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] entering [[Naples]] in 1495. From the manuscript MS 801 of the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] manuscripts collection ({{Circa|}} 1498).]]\nThe documents of Andreas's abdication were prepared by Francesco de Schracten of Florence, a pontifical and imperial notary, and Camillo Beninbene, also a notary and a doctor of canon and civil law, on 6 November 1494 in the Church of [[San Pietro in Montorio]], and in addition to Andreas and Peraudi, the affair was also witnessed by five clergymen.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}} Though Charles may still have been unaware of being granted the titles in November, [[Pope Alexander VI]] was probably very aware, since Andreas was provided for by him and Peraudi was a cardinal. The plan was perfect for Alexander VI, who like Peraudi hoped that the French armies marching through Italy were intended to be used against the Ottomans in the defense of Christendom and not against Naples. If the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], was to object to the sudden presence of another emperor in Western Europe, the Pope could simply point out that Andreas's abdication had not been papally sanctioned and that Peraudi had acted improperly on his own initiative.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=463}} Charles VIII's Italian campaigned caused some concern in Constantinople, and Bayezid began building up his defences, constructing new ships and artillery and redirecting his military forces to defensive positions throughout Greece and the lands surrounding Constantinople.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=464}}\n\nCharles eventually accepted the conditions of Andreas's abdications but did not divert from Naples. Though he considered declaring a crusade already while staying at [[Asti]] in northern Italy, he decided that he would only venture eastwards after he had conquered Naples,{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=463}} mainly due to the increased number of attack plans possible if Naples was under his control.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=468}} Charles's efforts were delayed as the king became embroiled in a conflict with the Papacy and states throughout Italy, but on 27 January 1495 he secured possession of Cem Sultan, Bayezid's brother and a rival claimant to the Ottoman throne, formerly in Papal captivity. Alexander VI even offered to personally crown him as the Emperor of Constantinople, but Charles refused, preferring to conquer the eastern empire before formally being crowned emperor.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=476}} On 22 February, Charles triumphantly entered Naples (supposedly wearing a imperial crown){{Sfn|Giesey|1960|p=118}} but three days later he was faced with a great loss through the death of Cem Sultan. Plans around the projected crusade had often revolved around the part Cem was expected to play. Though his army was still intact, Cem's death, combined with a league being formed against Charles VIII, brought with it a gradual abandonment of the crusading plans.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=482}}\n\nAlthough nothing ultimately came of the sale of the title, Charles had legitimately entertained the idea of attempting to conquer Constantinople from Sultan Bayezid II.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=552}}{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=468}} Hopes for a French invasion of the Ottoman Empire ended when Charles died in 1498.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=551\u2013552}} Though Andreas once more claimed his titles after 1498, the French kings after Charles VIII; [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], also continued to use imperial titles and honors. Not until [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] in 1566 did the imperial claim come to an eventual end through the rules of [[extinctive prescription]] as a direct result of desuetude, or lack of use. Charles IX wrote that the imperial Byzantine title \"is not more eminent than that of king, which sounds better and sweeter\".{{Sfn|Potter|1995|p=33}}\n\n=== Later life and death ===\nAndreas remained an active figure in Rome until his death. On 11 March 1501, Andreas prominently partook in the ceremonial entry of an ambassador from [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] into the city.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=553}}\n\nAndreas eventually died poor in Rome at some point in June 1502. In his will, written on 7 April that same year, he once more gave away his claim to the imperial title, this time to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] (neither of whom actually used the titles).{{Sfn|Enepekides|1960|p=|pp=138\u2013143}} His widow Caterina was given 104 ducats by Pope [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] to pay the costs of his funeral.{{Sfn|Runciman|1969|p=184}} He was buried with honour in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], next to his father Thomas.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} Since Andreas and Thomas were buried in Rome, their graves survived the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule,{{Sfn|Melvani|2018|p=260}} but modern efforts to locate their graves within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\n== Possible descendants ==\nAndreas is commonly believed to not have left any descendants. According to [[Donald Nicol]] in ''The Immortal Emperor'' (1992), it is possible that a Constantine Palaiologos who was employed in the Papal Guard in 1508 was a son of Andreas. Russian sources accord Andreas a daughter by the name Maria Palaiologina, unmentioned in western sources, who was married off to the Russian noble Prince Vasily Mihailovi\u0107 by her aunt (Andreas's sister) Sophia.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}} On 17 July 1499, [[Ludovico Sforza]], the Duke of Milan, reported that he had sent \"Don Fernando, son of the Despot of the Morea, nephew of the lord Constantine [Arianiti, governor of Montferrat], to the Turk with five horses\",{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=513}} possibly a diplomatic or espionage mission. This Fernando might have been another son of Andreas and though he did adopt the title Despot of the Morea after Andreas's death, he appears to have made relatively little impact on history, either because he was unwilling to play a prominent role or because he might possibly have been illegitimate, which would have hampered him.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=651}} The [[Constantine Komnenos Arianites|Constantine Arianiti]] referenced by Sforza, genealogically unconnected to Andreas, also claimed the title of Despot of the Morea a few months after Andreas's death.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=653}} [[Theodore Palaiologos (16th century)|Theodore Paleologus]], who lived in Cornwall in the 17th century and claimed descent from Thomas Palaiologos through an otherwise unattested son called John, might be a descendant of Andreas instead, but his lineage is highly uncertain.{{Sfn|Hall|2015|p=229}}\n\n== Legacy and analysis ==\n\n=== Negative portrayal by historians ===\n[[File:Facial Chronicle - b.17, p. 110.gif|thumb|16th century depiction in a Russian chronicle of Andreas's (the standing crowned figure in the center) visit to his sister [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]] (now called Sophia, shown in the window above the enthroned figure, [[Ivan III of Russia]]) in [[Moscow]].|alt=]]\nLater historians have overwhelmingly seen Andreas in a negative light. Scottish historian [[George Finlay]] wrote in 1877 of the fate of Andreas that it \"hardly merits the attention of history, were it not that mankind has a morbid curiosity concerning the fortunes of the most worthless princes\". According to the English historian [[Jonathan Harris (historian)|Jonathan Harris]], who in 1995 offered a more redeeming view of Andreas, he is typically characterized as \"an immoral and extravagant playboy who squandered his generous papal pension on loose living and eventually died in poverty\". Contrary to his typical portrayal, which he considered \"by no means entirely fair\", Harris believed that it would be wrong to dismiss Andreas as a footnote in history.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537}} \n\nAndreas's reputation might partly have been negatively impacted by the actions of his father Thomas, whose warring with his brother Demetrios (Andreas's uncle) allowed the Ottomans to conquer the Morea. The feud between his father and uncle had nothing to do with Andreas, who was just seven years old at the time he and his family fled into exile.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=538}} The financial situation of the Palaiologoi in the 1470s to 1490s must have been considerably bad for Andreas to sell his inherited titles and for Manuel to travel Europe in hopes of employment and eventually travel to the Ottomans in Constantinople. Only a single contemporary author and an author of the generation following the two brothers placed the blame of their financial hardships on Andreas. Writing in 1538, Theodore Spandugnino claimed that Andreas's brother Manuel was better in every possible way and writing in 1481, Gherardi da Volterra stated that Andreas's poor financial situation was due to his excessive indulging in \"lovemaking and pleasures\".{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=540}} This negative assessment was echoed by a vast number of modern historians, but has very little basis.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}}\n\nTo further paint Andreas negatively, virtually every modern account of his life mentions his 1479 marriage to Caterina,{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}} who is often cast in a particularly negative light. Historian [[Steven Runciman]] famously described her as \"a lady from the streets of Rome\" and she is typically identified as a prostitute.{{Sfn|Setton|1978|p=462}}{{Sfn|Hall|2015|p=229}} In addition to his financial ruin, marrying a prostitute is another point often used against Andreas. She is known from only a single source, the ''[[Introitus et Exitus]]'' books of the [[Apostolic Camera]], which mentions only her first name, meaning that her profession and social standing are actually unknown. Not even the contemporary critics of Andreas, da Volterra and Gherardi, mention her. The earliest reference to Caterina's \"bad character\" are from the works of the 17th-century Byzantinist [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange]], meaning that tales of Caterina have to be considered unsubstantiated oral tradition. The idea forwarded by Byzantinist [[Dionysios Zakythinos]] in his 20th-century work ''Le despotat grec de Mor\u00e9e (1262\u20131460)'' that Andreas's marriage to the \"prostitute\" Caterina was the cause of the Papacy cutting back his pension is demonstrably false; Pope Sixtus IV even paid Andreas two years worth of his pension in advance in 1479, presumably to cover the expenses of Andreas's journey to Moscow.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=541}}\n\nAlthough it is possible that Andreas did live an extravagant life, the more likely root cause for his poverty is the constant reductions to the pension paid to him by the Papacy. Though the Popes had been generous to the Palaiologoi on the face of it, providing housing and money, they were not as generous as some historians have claimed. The Popes themselves are partly responsible for propagating this idea. For instance, Sixtus IV recorded his own generosity towards the Palaiologoi by writing of his deeds on the frescoes of the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]]. One of the frescoes depicts Sixtus IV with a grateful Andreas, kneeling at his feet.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=542}} Andreas didn't, as usually stated, waste any enormous sums of Papal money; the monthly 300 ducat pension originally provided to his father Thomas had shrunken to only 50 ducats by 1492.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=545}}\n\nAndreas's attempted 1481 expedition against the Ottomans has mostly been discarded by historians as more evidence of his incompetence. Some modern historians have gone so far as to claim that Andreas \"squandered\" the money donated by the Pope and used it for \"other purposes\".{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=549}} Though the expedition ultimately never happened, there is no reason to believe that Andreas wasn't serious about it. On 15 September 1481, Sixtus IV had written to bishops in Italy to do \"everything in their power\" to aid Andreas's crossing of the Adriatic Sea. The fact that Andreas actually travelled to Brindisi also suggests that he was hoping to actually lead an expedition to restore the empire. One of the companions that had been hired by Andreas was Crocondilo Clada, a Greek soldier who had led an unsuccessful revolt in the Morea in 1480. Clada would have been an ideal guide if Andreas had successfully landed in Greece. Despite the campaign failing to materialize, the preperations conducted does demonstrate that Andreas did not spend his time in Rome solely in the pursuit of pleasure.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=550}}\n\nAlthough he did die poor, a common assertion is that Andreas died without any money at all. This information usually derives from the fact that Andreas's widow, Caterina, was given money by Pope Alexander VI so that she could pay for the funeral. However, such donations weren't rare or necessarily an indication of poverty. The 1487 funeral of another royal exile, Queen [[Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus|Charlotte of Cyprus]], was also paid for by the Papacy and there are no records of her being described as extravagant or impoverished. Andreas was buried with honour in the St. Peter's Basilica, suggesting that he had at least retained a certain status.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}}\n\n=== Failure of Palaiologan policy ===\n[[File:Sketches of John VIII Palaiologos during his visit at the council of Florence in 1438 by Pisanello.jpg|thumb|Sketches of Andreas's uncle, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], during his visit at the [[Council of Florence]] in 1438, by [[Pisanello]]]]\nHarris considered the exile of Andreas in Rome as the continuation, and ultimate failure, of a policy pursued by the Palaiologoi for over a century.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537}} Since the middle of the 14th century, the Byzantine emperors had looked to Western Europe and the Papacy in the hope of secure help to save their empire from the Turks. Inspired by the writings of west-oriented intellectuals such as [[Demetrios Kydones]] and [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], the Palaiologan emperors belived that if they could only convince the Popes of their religious orthodoxy, the Papacy would unleash large western armies to relieve them.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=547}} This conviction inspired Andreas's great-grandfather [[John V Palaiologos]] to travel to Rome and personally submit to the Pope in 1369 and his uncle [[John VIII Palaiologos]] to attend the 1438\u20131439 [[Council of Florence]] where a union of the churches was proclaimed. Constantine XI had sent desperate appeals for help to the Pope in 1452 when the Ottomans were closing in on Constantinople. The ultimate plan of securing Papal aid for a grand reconquest and restoration continued, unsuccessfully as before, through Thomas and Andreas.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=548}}\n\nUltimately, Andreas's life wasn't a great success and his dreams of restoring of the Byzantine Empire were dashed by constantly having to see to raising the necessary funds to support himself and his household. His difficult situation was not his own fault, and though the degradation of Papal support is the most direct cause for his hardships, the fault ultimately was in the Palaiologan policy of looking to the west for aid itself. The emperors had adopted this policy since their situation in the 14th and 15th centuries offered little other options and they clung to it even though little aid ever arrived, despite many promises. The fact that the west was ultimately powerless to aid Byzantium was a factor in the empire's downfall and ensured that Andreas never returned to his homeland.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pretenders to the Byzantine throne]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite journal|last=Enepekides|first=P.
