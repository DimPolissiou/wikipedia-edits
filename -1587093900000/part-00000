He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll. Her love for animals is a recurring theme, be it penguins,<ref name=\"Cold Duck\" /> koalas,<ref name=\"Back Out in the Outback\" /> dinosaurs,<ref name=\"Dinosaur Ducks\" /> or even the [[Yeti]].<ref name=\"Lost Crown of Genghis Khan\" /> Webby is typically wearing a pink shirt and a large hairbow, she is usually rather timid, and often has difficulties being accepted by the boys,<ref name=\"Bustle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/webby-vanderquack-has-a-bigger-role-in-the-ducktales-reboot-representing-adventurous-girls-everywhere-74642|title=Webby Vanderquack Has A Bigger Role In The 'DuckTales' Reboot, Representing Adventurous Girls Everywhere|first=Jack|last=O'Keeffe|publisher=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2018-07-15}}</ref> although she is also a capable Junior Woodchuck scout.<ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Webby is around the boys' age, being an intellectual [[nerd]] and somewhat of an athletic [[genius]], with her character wearing a pink and blue sweater vest, a purple skirt, and a smaller hairbow on her right-side. She is revealed to be an enthusiastic adventure fan and [[Clan McDuck]] historian who idolizes Scrooge McDuck as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.imes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-ducktales-d23-expo-20170715-story.html|title='DuckTales' clip shows a whole new Webby Vanderquack|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=2017-07-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Having spent most of her life sheltered from the outside world by her grandmother (among the activities withheld from her prior to her befriending Huey, Dewey and Louie are theme park visits<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> and sledding<ref name=\"The Impossible Summit of Mt.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /><ref name=\"The Shadow War!\" /><ref name=\"Friendship Hates Magic!\" />\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews.

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y.

Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings.

After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a [[screen test]] as [[Vito Corleone]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972). He got the part, and subsequently won his second Academy Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. ''The Godfather'' was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\n\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid [[character actor]] in [[Cameo appearance|cameo roles]], such as in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), as [[Colonel Kurtz]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), and in ''[[The Formula (1980 film)|The Formula]]'' (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film.

Brando exceled at theater and did well in the school. In his final year (1943), he was put on probation for being insubordinate to a visiting army colonel during maneuvers. He was confined to his room, but sneaked into town and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, though he was supported by the students, who thought expulsion was too harsh. He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. Brando worked as a ditch-digger as a summer job arranged by his father. He tried to enlist in the Army, but his induction physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at Shattuck had left him with a [[Luxating patella|trick knee]].

In a 1988 documentary, ''Marlon Brando: The Wild One'', Brando's sister [[Jocelyn Brando|Jocelyn]] remembered, \"He was in a school play and enjoyed it&nbsp;... So he decided he would go to New York and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed. That was when he was 18.\" In the A&E ''Biography'' episode on Brando, George Englund said Brando fell into acting in New York because \"he was accepted there. He wasn't criticized. It was the first time in his life that he heard good things about himself.\" He spent his first few months in New York sleeping on friends' couches. For a time he lived with [[Roy Somlyo]], who later became a four time Emmy winning Broadway producer.<ref>\"Marlon Brando\", A&E ''Biography'' episode.</ref>\n\nBrando was an avid student and proponent of [[Stella Adler]], from whom he learned the techniques of the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski system]]. This technique encouraged the actor to explore both internal and external aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on. Adler used to recount that when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg. Asked by Adler why he had chosen to react this way, he said, \"I'm a chicken\u2014what do I know about bombs?\"<ref>Adler and Paris, 1999, p. 271.</ref> Despite being commonly regarded as a [[Method acting|method actor]], Brando disagreed. He claimed to have abhorred [[Lee Strasberg]]'s teachings:\n\n{{quote|After I had some success, Lee Strasberg tried to take credit for teaching me how to act. He never taught me anything. He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it. He was an ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why. I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday mornings because [[Elia Kazan]] was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls, but Strasberg never taught me acting.

According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, ''[[Listen To Me Marlon]]'', he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals, meaning they were predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF_hdkdBf-Q|title=Marlon Brando In His Own Words \u2013 LISTEN TO ME MARLON|last=TheLipTV|date=July 30, 2015|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609174411/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF_hdkdBf-Q|archivedate=June 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career: 1944\u20131951===\n[[File:Brando van Vechten3.jpg|thumb|upright|A 24-year-old Marlon Brando on the set of the Broadway production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', 1948]]\nBrando used his Stanislavski System skills for his first [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] roles in [[Sayville, New York]], on [[Long Island]].

Then, in 1944, he made it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the bittersweet drama ''[[I Remember Mama (play)|I Remember Mama]]'', playing the son of [[Mady Christians]]. The Lunts wanted Brando to play the role of [[Alfred Lunt]]'s son in ''O Mistress Mine'', and Lunt even coached him for his audition, but Brando's reading during the audition was so desultory that they couldn't hire him. [[New York Drama Critics Award|New York Drama Critics]] voted him \"Most Promising Young Actor\" for his role as an anguished veteran in ''[[Truckline Cafe|Truckline Caf\u00e9]]'', although the play was a commercial failure. In 1946, he appeared on Broadway as the young hero in the political drama ''[[A Flag is Born]]'', refusing to accept wages above the [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors' Equity]] rate.<ref name=\"journal\">Kemp, Louie.

Bankhead had turned down the role of [[Blanche Dubois]] in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946\u20131947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. \"I don't care what your grandmother did,\" Wilson exclaimed, \"and that Method stuff, I want to know what you're going to do!\" Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. \"It was marvelous,\" a cast member recalled. \"Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'\"\n\nCritics were not as kind, however. A review of Brando's performance in the opening assessed that Brando was \"still building his character, but at present fails to impress.\" One Boston critic remarked of Brando's prolonged death scene, \"Brando looked like a car in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space.\" He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate. \"There were a few times when he was really magnificent,\" Bankhead admitted to an interviewer in 1962. \"He was a great young actor when he wanted to be, but most of the time I couldn't even hear him on the stage.\"\n\nBrando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners. He \"tried everything in the world to ruin it for her,\" Bankhead's stage manager claimed. \"He nearly drove her crazy: scratching his crotch, picking his nose, doing anything.\" After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him. This proved to be one of the greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of [[Stanley Kowalski]] in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s 1947 play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', directed by [[Elia Kazan]]. Bankhead had recommended him to Williams for the role of Stanley, thinking he was perfect for the part.\n\nPierpont writes that [[John Garfield]] was first choice for the role, but \"made impossible demands.\" It was Kazan's decision to fall back on the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: \"It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man&nbsp;... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard.\" Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer [[Rocky Graziano]], whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, \"The curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym, and he's playing me.\"<ref>Graziano and Barber 1955</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1947, Brando performed a screen test for an early [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] script for the novel ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1944), which bore no relation to the film eventually produced in 1955.<ref>Voynar, Kim.

He spent a month in bed at the Birmingham Army Hospital in [[Van Nuys]] to prepare for the role. ''The New York Times'' reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote that Brando as Ken \"is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete\" and noted, \"Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut.\"\n\nBy Brando's own account, it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4-F to [[Selective Service System#Classifications|1-A]]. He had had surgery on his trick knee, and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft. When Brando reported to the induction center, he answered a questionnaire by saying his [[Race (human categorization)|race]] was \"human\", his color was \"Seasonal-oyster white to beige\", and he told an Army doctor that he was psychoneurotic. When the draft board referred him to a psychiatrist, Brando explained that he had been expelled from military school and had severe problems with authority.

The role is regarded as one of Brando's greatest. The reception of Brando's performance was so positive that Brando quickly became a male sex symbol in Hollywood. The role earned him his first [[Academy Award]] nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor category]].\n\n[[File:Viva Zapata movie trailer screenshot (25).jpg|thumb|left|Brando as [[Emiliano Zapata]] in a trailer for the 1952 film ''Viva Zapata!'']]\nHe was also nominated the next year for ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952), a fictionalized account of the life of Mexican revolutionary [[Emiliano Zapata]]. It recounted his peasant upbringing, his rise to power in the early 20th century, and death. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and co-starred [[Anthony Quinn]]. In the biopic ''Marlon Brando: The Wild One'', Sam Shaw says, \"Secretly, before the picture started, he went to Mexico to the very town where Zapata lived and was born in and it was there that he studied the speech patterns of people, their behavior, movement.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Most critics focused on the actor rather than the film, with ''Time'' and ''Newsweek'' publishing rave reviews.\n\nYears later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: \"Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally and liked personally, played my brother, but he was extremely cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why.\" Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, \"Gadg\" (Kazan) had told Quinn\u2014who had taken over the role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished\u2014that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.\n\nBrando's next film, ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1953), received highly favorable reviews. Brando portrayed [[Mark Antony]]. While most acknowledged Brando's talent, some critics felt Brando's \"mumbling\" and other idiosyncrasies betrayed a lack of acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success. Directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and co-starring British stage actor [[John Gielgud]], Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony's noted \"Friends, Romans, countrymen&nbsp;...\" speech. Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined. In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, \"Marlon's autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, 'for me to walk onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine'\u2014yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kanfer|first1=Stefan|title=Somebody: The Reckless Life and Remarkable Career of Marlon Brando|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vlF3ZW0RTQUC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=%22self-denigration,+and+wholly+incorrect%22#v=onepage&q=%22self-denigration%2C%20and%20wholly%20incorrect%22&f=false|accessdate=November 12, 2016|isbn=9780571278787|date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> Kanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented, \"Christ! It was like a furnace door opening\u2014the heat came off the screen. I don't know another actor who could do that.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} During the filming of ''Julius Caesar'', Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of \"subversives\" to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC). By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in ''On The Waterfront''. \"None of us is perfect,\" he later wrote in his memoir, \"and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 1953, Brando also starred in ''[[The Wild One]]'', riding his own [[Triumph Thunderbird]] 6T motorcycle. Triumph's importers were ambivalent at the exposure, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town. The film was criticized for its perceived gratuitous violence at the time, with ''Time'' stating, \"The effect of the movie is not to throw light on the public problem, but to shoot adrenaline through the moviegoer's veins.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Brando allegedly did not see eye to eye with the Hungarian director [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek]] and did not get on with costar [[Lee Marvin]].\n\nTo Brando's expressed puzzlement, the movie inspired teen rebellion and made him a role model to the nascent rock-and-roll generation and future stars such as [[James Dean]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. After the movie's release, the sales of [[leather jacket]]s and blue [[jeans]] skyrocketed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Reflecting on the movie in his autobiography, Brando concluded that it had not aged very well but said:\n\n{{quote|More than most parts I've played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned. There's a line in the picture where he snarls, 'Nobody tells me what to do.' That's exactly how I've felt all my life.<ref>Brando and Lindsey 1994, p. 178</ref>}}\n\nLater that same year, Brando starred in [[Lee Falk]]'s production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' in Boston. Falk was proud to tell people that Brando turned down an offer of $10,000 per week on Broadway, in favor of working in his production in [[Boston]], for less than $500 per week.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n====''On the Waterfront''====\nIn 1954, Brando starred in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a [[crime drama film]] about union violence and [[corruption]] among [[longshoremen]]. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and written by [[Budd Schulberg]]; it also starred [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]] and, in her film debut, [[Eva Marie Saint]]. When initially offered the role, Brando\u2014still stung by Kazan's testimony to HUAC\u2014demurred and the part of Terry Malloy nearly went to [[Frank Sinatra]]. According to biographer Stefan Kanfer, the director believed that Sinatra, who grew up in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] (where the film takes place and was shot), would work as Malloy, but eventually producer [[Sam Spiegel]] wooed Brando to the part, signing him for $100,000. \"Kazan made no protest because, he subsequently confessed, 'I always preferred Brando to anybody.'\"<ref name=\"Kanfer2011\">Kanfer 2008, p. 125.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eva marie saint marlon brando waterfront 10.jpg|thumb|Brando with [[Eva Marie Saint]] in the trailer for ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954).]]\nBrando won the Oscar for his role as [[Irish-American]] stevedore Terry Malloy in ''[[On the Waterfront]]''. His performance, spurred on by his rapport with Eva Marie Saint and Kazan's direction, was praised as a ''tour de force''. For the scene in which Terry laments his failings, saying ''I coulda been a contender'', he convinced Kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic. Schulberg's script had Brando acting the entire scene with his character being held at gunpoint by his brother Charlie, played by [[Rod Steiger]]. Brando insisted on gently pushing away the gun, saying that Terry would never believe that his brother would pull the trigger and doubting that he could continue his speech while fearing a gun on him. Kazan let Brando improvise and later expressed deep admiration for Brando's instinctive understanding, saying:\n\n{{quote|what was extraordinary about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior. What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress? Who else could read \"Oh, Charlie!\" in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests the terrific depth of pain?&nbsp;...

Much later, it turned up at a London auction house, which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereabouts.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Box office successes and directorial debut: 1954\u20131959===\nFollowing ''On the Waterfront'', Brando remained a top box office draw, but critics increasingly felt his performances were half-hearted, lacking the intensity and commitment found in his earlier work, especially in his work with Kazan. He portrayed [[Napoleon]] in the 1954 film ''[[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (film)|D\u00e9sir\u00e9e]]''. According to co-star [[Jean Simmons]], Brando's contract forced him to star in the movie. He put little effort into the role, claiming he didn't like the script, and later dismissed the entire movie as \"superficial and dismal\". Brando was especially contemptuous of director [[Henry Koster]].\n\nBrando and Simmons were paired together again in the film adaptation of the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955). ''Guys and Dolls'' would be Brando's first and last musical role. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' found the picture \"false to the original in its feeling\", remarking that Brando \"sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat.\" Appearing in [[Edward R. Murrow|Edward Murrow]]'s ''Person to Person'' interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called \"pretty terrible.\" In the 1965 documentary ''Meet Marlon Brando'', he revealed that the final product heard in the movie was a result of countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, \"I couldn't hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins&nbsp;... They sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when I mouthed it in front of the camera, I nearly asphyxiated myself\". Relations between Brando and costar [[Frank Sinatra]] were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing: \"The two men were diametrical opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself.\" Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, \"Don't give me any of that Actors Studio shit.\" Brando later quipped, \"Frank is the kind of guy, when he dies, he's going to heaven and give God a hard time for making him bald.\" Frank Sinatra called Brando \"the world's most overrated actor\", and referred to him as \"mumbles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2014/06/07/10-strange-stories-about-frank-sinatra/|title=10 Strange Stories About Frank Sinatra|author=Nolan Moore|date=June 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202103130/http://listverse.com/2014/06/07/10-strange-stories-about-frank-sinatra/|archivedate=February 2, 2017}}</ref> The film was commercially though not critically successful, costing $5.5&nbsp;million to make and grossing $13&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nBrando played Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar [[Japan]], in ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' (1956). [[Pauline Kael]] was not particularly impressed by the movie, but noted \"Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, and he looks as if he's enjoying the stunt\u2014talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs. He's harmlessly genial (and he is certainly missed when he's offscreen), though the fey, roguish role doesn't allow him to do what he's great at and it's possible that he's less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been.\" In ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957) he appeared as a United States Air Force officer. ''[[Newsweek]]'' found the film a \"dull tale of the meeting of the twain\", but it was nevertheless a box-office success. According to Stefan Kanfer's biography of the actor, Brando's manager Jay Kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to Brando, which put him in the millionaire category. The movie was controversial due to openly discussing [[interracial marriage]], but proved a great success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, with Brando being nominated for Best Actor. The film went on to win four Academy Awards. ''Teahouse'' and ''Sayonara'' were the first in a string of films Brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages, and he formed a partnership with Paramount to establish his own production company called Pennebaker, its declared purpose to develop films that contained \"social value that would improve the world.\" The name was a tribute in honor of his mother, who had died in 1954. By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', \"She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring.\" Brando appointed his father to run Pennebaker. In the same A&E special, George Englund claims that Brando gave his father the job because \"it gave Marlon a chance to take shots at him, to demean and diminish him\".\n\nIn 1958, Brando appeared in ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'', dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film is based on the novel by [[Irwin Shaw]], and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, \"The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about [[Nazism]]; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a clich\u00e9 of evil&nbsp;... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled.\" Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent [[David Schoenbrun]] and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating \"Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation.\" ''The Young Lions'' also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival [[Montgomery Clift]] (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in ''[[The Fugitive Kind]]'' (1960) opposite [[Anna Magnani]]. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' had been, with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' labeling Williams's personae \"psychologically sick or just plain ugly\" and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' calling it a \"cornpone melodrama\".\n\n===''One-Eyed Jacks'' and ''Mutiny on the Bounty''===\n[[File:Pina Pellicer and Marlon Brando publicity photo One-Eyed Jacks (1961).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marlon Brando with [[Pina Pellicer]] in a publicity photo for ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961).]]\nIn 1961, Brando made his directorial debut in the western ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''. The picture was originally directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], but he was fired early in the production. Paramount then made Brando the director. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and [[Karl Malden]] plays his partner \"Dad\" Longworth. The supporting cast features [[Katy Jurado]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], and [[Slim Pickens]]. Brando's penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars. Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually took control of the film. Brando later wrote, \"Paramount said it didn't like my version of the story; I'd had everyone lie except Karl Malden. The studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar, too. By then, I was bored with the whole project and walked away from it.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} ''One-Eyed Jacks'' was poorly reviewed by critics.

The actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production. On June 16, 1962, ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' ran an article by Bill Davidson with the headline \"Six million dollars down the drain: the mutiny of Marlon Brando\". ''Mutiny'' director [[Lewis Milestone]] claimed that the executives \"deserve what they get when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture.\" '' Mutiny on the Bounty'' nearly capsized MGM and, while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than Brando's behavior, the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear Brando's difficult reputation. Critics also began taking note of his fluctuating weight.\n\n===Box office decline: 1963\u20131971===\nDistracted by his personal life and becoming disillusioned with his career, Brando began to view acting as a means to a financial end. Critics protested when he started accepting roles in films many perceived as being beneath his talent, or criticized him for failing to live up to the better roles. Previously only signing short-term deals with film studios, in 1961 Brando uncharacteristically signed a five-picture deal with Universal Studios that would haunt him for the rest of the decade. ''[[The Ugly American (film)|The Ugly American]]'' (1963) was the first of these films. Based on the 1958 novel of the same title that Pennebaker had optioned, the film, which featured Brando's sister Jocelyn, was rated fairly positively but died at the box office. Brando was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. All of Brando's other Universal films during this period, including ''[[Bedtime Story (1964 film)|Bedtime Story]]'' (1964), ''[[The Appaloosa]]'' (1966), ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Night of the Following Day]]'' (1969), were also critical and commercial flops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marlon-brando-declines-best-actor-oscar|title=Marlon Brando declines Best Actor Oscar \u2013 Mar 27, 1973|publisher=HISTORY.com|access-date=August 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816191215/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marlon-brando-declines-best-actor-oscar|archivedate=August 16, 2017}}</ref> ''Countess'' in particular was a disappointment for Brando, who had looked forward to working with one of his heroes, director [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The experience turned out to be an unhappy one; Brando was horrified at Chaplin's didactic style of direction and his authoritarian approach. Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller ''[[Morituri (1965 film)|Morituri]]'' in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience.\n\nBrando acknowledged his professional decline, writing later, \"Some of the films I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like ''The Night of the Following Day'', I made only for the money; others, like ''[[Candy (1968 film)|Candy]]'', I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down&nbsp;... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years.\" ''Candy'' was especially appalling for many; a 1968 [[Bedroom farce|sex farce]] film directed by [[Christian Marquand]] and based on the 1958 novel by [[Terry Southern]], the film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by [[Ewa Aulin]]. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' observed: \"Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents.\" In the March 1966 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando \"was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap\", but now Brando and others like him had become \"buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations.\" In an earlier review of ''The Appaloosa'' in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was \"trapped in another dog of a movie&nbsp;... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner.\" Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film ''[[Listen to Me Marlon]]'', \"They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot.\"{{Cite quote|date=February 2016}}\n\nBrando portrayed a repressed [[gay]] army officer in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'', directed by [[John Huston]] and costarring [[Elizabeth Taylor]].

The film deals with themes of racism, sexual revolution, small-town corruption, and vigilantism. The film was received mostly positively.\n\nBrando cited ''[[Burn!]]'' (1969) as his personal favorite of the films he had made, writing in his autobiography, \"I think I did some of the best acting I've ever done in that picture, but few people came to see it.\" Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, [[Gillo Pontecorvo]], was the best director he had ever worked with next to Kazan and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]. Brando also detailed his clashes with Pontecorvo on the set and how \"we nearly killed each other.\" Loosely based on events in the history of Guadeloupe, the film got a hostile reception from critics. In 1971, [[Michael Winner]] directed him in the British horror film ''[[The Nightcomers]]'' with [[Stephanie Beacham]], [[Thora Hird]], [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Anna Palk]]. It is a prequel to ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'', which later became the 1961 film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]''.

He bested Brando at the [[1972 New York Film Critics Circle Awards]].) [[Albert S. Ruddy]], whom Paramount assigned to produce the film, agreed with the choice of Brando. However, Paramount studio heads were opposed to casting Brando due to his reputation for difficulty and his long string of box office flops. Brando also had ''One-Eyed Jacks'' working against him, a troubled production that lost money for Paramount when it was released in 1961. Paramount Pictures President [[Stanley R. Jaffe|Stanley Jaffe]] told an exasperated Coppola, \"As long as I'm president of this studio, Marlon Brando will not be in this picture, and I will no longer allow you to discuss it.\"<ref>Lebo 2005, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\nJaffe eventually set three conditions for the casting of Brando: That he would have to take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped \"make-up\" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, \"I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully.\" Eventually, [[Charles Bluhdorn]], the president of Paramount parent [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]], was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, \"What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?\" Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10&nbsp;million over a $10&nbsp;million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60&nbsp;million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. \"That $100,000 cost him $11&nbsp;million,\" Evans claimed.<ref>Grobel 2000, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn a 1994 interview that can be found on the Academy of Achievement website, Coppola insisted, \"''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired.\" When word of this reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir, \"I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision, though Francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do.\" In a 2010 television interview with [[Larry King]], [[Al Pacino]] also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of [[Michael Corleone]] in the movie\u2014despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him. Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included Pacino, [[Robert Duvall]], [[James Caan]], and [[Diane Keaton]].

'I used to meet with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in Cromwell's Drugstore, and if we mentioned his name once, we mentioned it 25 times in a day.' Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'\"\n\nBrando's performance was glowingly reviewed by critics. \"I thought it would be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys [[Edward G. Robinson]] played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected,\" Brando recalled in his autobiography. \"Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike [[Al Capone]], who beat up people with baseball bats.\" Duvall later marveled to A&E's ''Biography'', \"He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word ''action''. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. ''Cut!'' It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that.\" Brando won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after [[George C.

Lee Clayton: \"Marlon made him a cross-dressing [[psychopath]]. Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style. He speaks in an Irish accent for no apparent reason. Over the next hour, also for no apparent reason, Clayton assumes the intonation of a British upper-class twit and an elderly frontier woman, complete with a [[granny dress]] and matching bonnet. Penn, who believed in letting actors do their thing, indulged Marlon all the way.\"{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=269}} Critics were unkind, with ''[[The Observer]]'' calling Brando's performance \"one of the most extravagant displays of ''grandedamerie'' since [[Sarah Bernhardt]]\",{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=270}} while ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' complained, \"Marlon Brando at fifty-two has the sloppy belly of a sixty-two-year-old, the white hair of a seventy-two-year-old, and the lack of discipline of a precocious twelve-year-old.\"{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=270}} However, Kanfer noted: \"Even though his late work was met with disapproval, a re-examination shows that often, in the middle of the most pedestrian scene, there would be a sudden, luminous occurrence, a flash of the old Marlon that showed how capable he remained.\"{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=270}}\n\nIn 1978, Brando narrated the English version of ''[[Raoni]]'', a French-Belgian documentary film directed by [[Jean-Pierre Dutilleux]] and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of [[Raoni Metuktire]] and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil. Brando portrayed [[Superman]]'s father [[Jor-El]] in the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of ''Superman'' that he was paid $3.7&nbsp;million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, ''[[Superman II]]'', but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. \"I asked for my usual percentage,\" he recollected in his memoir, \"but they refused, and so did I.\" However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 re-cut of the film, ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' and in the 2006 \"loose sequel\" ''[[Superman Returns]]'', in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two ''Superman'' films was remastered for a scene in the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1979, he made a rare television appearance in the miniseries ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'', portraying [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]; he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie|Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for his performance.\n\nBrando starred as [[Colonel Kurtz|Colonel Walter E. Kurtz]] in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979). He plays a highly decorated U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military as much as the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1&nbsp;million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as [[Eleanor Coppola]]'s documentary ''Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'' documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, [[Martin Sheen]] suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: \"He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me that he was going to get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was ''so'' fat, he was very, very shy about it&nbsp;... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way.\" Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer [[Fred Roos]]: \"The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage&nbsp;... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging\u2014and yet he's getting paid for it.\"\n\nUpon release, ''Apocalypse Now'' earned critical acclaim, as did Brando's performance. His whispering of Kurtz's final words ''\"The horror! The horror!\"'', has become particularly famous. [[Roger Ebert]], writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', defended the movie's controversial ''denouement'', opining that the ending, \"with Brando's fuzzy, brooding monologues and the final violence, feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Apocalypse Now |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/apocalypse-now-1979 |website=Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n===Later work===\nAfter appearing as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's ''[[The Formula (1980 film)|The Formula]]'', which was poorly received critically, Brando announced his retirement from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in ''[[A Dry White Season]]'', based on [[Andr\u00e9 Brink]]'s 1979 [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director [[Euzhan Palcy]] over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance in an interview with [[Connie Chung]] to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy \"had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best.\" Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival.\n\nBrando scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]].''

He gained a great deal of weight in the 1970s and by the early to mid-1990s he weighed over {{convert|300|lb|kg}} and suffered from [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]]. He had a history of weight fluctuation throughout his career that, by and large, he attributed to his years of stress-related overeating followed by compensatory dieting. He also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd demands. He also dabbled with some innovation in his last years. He had several patents issued in his name from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]], all of which involve a method of tensioning [[drumhead]]s, in June 2002 \u2013 November 2004.

He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he disclaimed responsibility for either. On June 12, 1973, Brando broke [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]] [[Ron Galella]]'s jaw. Galella had followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], after a taping of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in [[New York City]].

Galella wore a football helmet the next time he photographed Brando at a gala benefiting the American Indians Development Association.\n\nThe filming of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' affected Brando's life in a profound way, as he fell in love with Tahiti and its people. He bought a 12-island [[atoll]], [[Tetiaroa]], and in 1970 hired an award-winning young Los Angeles architect, [[Bernard Judge]], to build his home and natural village there without despoiling the environment.

Shortly after King's death, he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film (''[[The Arrangement (1969 film)|The Arrangement]]'') (1969) which was about to begin production in order to devote himself to the civil rights movement. \"I felt I'd better go find out where it is; what it is to be black in this country; what this rage is all about,\" Brando said on the late-night [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] talk show ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|Joey Bishop Show]]''.

It was exhausting.{{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}\n\nBrando repeatedly credited Stella Adler and her understanding of the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski acting technique]] for bringing realism to American cinema, but also added:\n\n{{quote|This school of acting served the American theater and motion pictures well, but it was restricting. The American theater has never been able to present [[Shakespeare]] or classical drama of any kind satisfactorily. We simply do not have the style, the regard for the language or the cultural disposition ... You cannot mumble in Shakespeare. You cannot improvise, and you are required to adhere strictly to the text. The English theater has a sense of language that we do not recognize ... In the United States the English language has developed almost into a patois.{{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}\n\nIn the 2015 documentary ''[[Listen to Me Marlon]]'', Brando shared his thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, \"That's a tough scene to play.

After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a [[screen test]] as [[Vito Corleone]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972).

Brando exceled at theater and did well in the school. In his final year (1943), he was put on probation for being insubordinate to a visiting army colonel during maneuvers. He was confined to his room, but sneaked into town and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, though he was supported by the students, who thought expulsion was too harsh. He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. Brando worked as a ditch-digger as a summer job arranged by his father. He tried to enlist in the Army, but his induction physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at Shattuck had left him with a [[Luxating patella|trick knee]]. He was classified [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|4-F]] and not inducted.<ref name=\"songs\"/>\n\n===New York and acting===\nBrando decided to follow his sisters to New York, studying at the American Theatre Wing Professional School, part of the Dramatic Workshop of the [[The New School|New School]], with influential German director [[Erwin Piscator]]. In a 1988 documentary, ''Marlon Brando: The Wild One'', Brando's sister [[Jocelyn Brando|Jocelyn]] remembered, \"He was in a school play and enjoyed it&nbsp;... So he decided he would go to New York and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed. That was when he was 18.\" In the A&E ''Biography'' episode on Brando, George Englund said Brando fell into acting in New York because \"he was accepted there. He wasn't criticized. It was the first time in his life that he heard good things about himself.\" He spent his first few months in New York sleeping on friends' couches. For a time he lived with [[Roy Somlyo]], who later became a four time Emmy winning Broadway producer.<ref>\"Marlon Brando\", A&E ''Biography'' episode.</ref>\n\nBrando was an avid student and proponent of [[Stella Adler]], from whom he learned the techniques of the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski system]]. This technique encouraged the actor to explore both internal and external aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on. Adler used to recount that when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg. Asked by Adler why he had chosen to react this way, he said, \"I'm a chicken\u2014what do I know about bombs?\"<ref>Adler and Paris, 1999, p. 271.</ref> Despite being commonly regarded as a [[Method acting|method actor]], Brando disagreed. He claimed to have abhorred [[Lee Strasberg]]'s teachings:\n\n{{quote|After I had some success, Lee Strasberg tried to take credit for teaching me how to act. He never taught me anything. He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it. He was an ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why. I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday mornings because [[Elia Kazan]] was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls, but Strasberg never taught me acting.

According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, ''[[Listen To Me Marlon]]'', he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals, meaning they were predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF_hdkdBf-Q|title=Marlon Brando In His Own Words \u2013 LISTEN TO ME MARLON|last=TheLipTV|date=July 30, 2015|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609174411/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF_hdkdBf-Q|archivedate=June 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career: 1944\u20131951===\n[[File:Brando van Vechten3.jpg|thumb|upright|A 24-year-old Marlon Brando on the set of the Broadway production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', 1948]]\nBrando used his Stanislavski System skills for his first [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] roles in [[Sayville, New York]], on [[Long Island]]. Brando established a pattern of erratic, insubordinate behavior in the few shows he had been in. His behavior had him kicked out of the cast of the New School's production in Sayville, but he was soon afterwards discovered in a locally produced play there. Then, in 1944, he made it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the bittersweet drama ''[[I Remember Mama (play)|I Remember Mama]]'', playing the son of [[Mady Christians]]. The Lunts wanted Brando to play the role of [[Alfred Lunt]]'s son in ''O Mistress Mine'', and Lunt even coached him for his audition, but Brando's reading during the audition was so desultory that they couldn't hire him. [[New York Drama Critics Award|New York Drama Critics]] voted him \"Most Promising Young Actor\" for his role as an anguished veteran in ''[[Truckline Cafe|Truckline Caf\u00e9]]'', although the play was a commercial failure.

Bankhead had turned down the role of [[Blanche Dubois]] in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946\u20131947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. \"I don't care what your grandmother did,\" Wilson exclaimed, \"and that Method stuff, I want to know what you're going to do!\" Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. \"It was marvelous,\" a cast member recalled. \"Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'\"\n\nCritics were not as kind, however. A review of Brando's performance in the opening assessed that Brando was \"still building his character, but at present fails to impress.\" One Boston critic remarked of Brando's prolonged death scene, \"Brando looked like a car in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space.\" He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate. \"There were a few times when he was really magnificent,\" Bankhead admitted to an interviewer in 1962. \"He was a great young actor when he wanted to be, but most of the time I couldn't even hear him on the stage.\"\n\nBrando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners. He \"tried everything in the world to ruin it for her,\" Bankhead's stage manager claimed. \"He nearly drove her crazy: scratching his crotch, picking his nose, doing anything.\" After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him. This proved to be one of the greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of [[Stanley Kowalski]] in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s 1947 play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', directed by [[Elia Kazan]]. Bankhead had recommended him to Williams for the role of Stanley, thinking he was perfect for the part.\n\nPierpont writes that [[John Garfield]] was first choice for the role, but \"made impossible demands.\" It was Kazan's decision to fall back on the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: \"It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man&nbsp;... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard.\" Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer [[Rocky Graziano]], whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, \"The curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym, and he's playing me.\"<ref>Graziano and Barber 1955</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1947, Brando performed a screen test for an early [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] script for the novel ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1944), which bore no relation to the film eventually produced in 1955.<ref>Voynar, Kim.

He spent a month in bed at the Birmingham Army Hospital in [[Van Nuys]] to prepare for the role. ''The New York Times'' reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote that Brando as Ken \"is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete\" and noted, \"Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut.\"\n\nBy Brando's own account, it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4-F to [[Selective Service System#Classifications|1-A]]. He had had surgery on his trick knee, and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft. When Brando reported to the induction center, he answered a questionnaire by saying his [[Race (human categorization)|race]] was \"human\", his color was \"Seasonal-oyster white to beige\", and he told an Army doctor that he was psychoneurotic. When the draft board referred him to a psychiatrist, Brando explained that he had been expelled from military school and had severe problems with authority.

The role is regarded as one of Brando's greatest. The reception of Brando's performance was so positive that Brando quickly became a male sex symbol in Hollywood. The role earned him his first [[Academy Award]] nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor category]].\n\n[[File:Viva Zapata movie trailer screenshot (25).jpg|thumb|left|Brando as [[Emiliano Zapata]] in a trailer for the 1952 film ''Viva Zapata!'']]\nHe was also nominated the next year for ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952), a fictionalized account of the life of Mexican revolutionary [[Emiliano Zapata]]. It recounted his peasant upbringing, his rise to power in the early 20th century, and death. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and co-starred [[Anthony Quinn]]. In the biopic ''Marlon Brando: The Wild One'', Sam Shaw says, \"Secretly, before the picture started, he went to Mexico to the very town where Zapata lived and was born in and it was there that he studied the speech patterns of people, their behavior, movement.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Most critics focused on the actor rather than the film, with ''Time'' and ''Newsweek'' publishing rave reviews.\n\nYears later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: \"Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally and liked personally, played my brother, but he was extremely cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why.\" Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, \"Gadg\" (Kazan) had told Quinn\u2014who had taken over the role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished\u2014that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.\n\nBrando's next film, ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1953), received highly favorable reviews. Brando portrayed [[Mark Antony]]. While most acknowledged Brando's talent, some critics felt Brando's \"mumbling\" and other idiosyncrasies betrayed a lack of acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success. Directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and co-starring British stage actor [[John Gielgud]], Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony's noted \"Friends, Romans, countrymen&nbsp;...\" speech. Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined. In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, \"Marlon's autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, 'for me to walk onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine'\u2014yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kanfer|first1=Stefan|title=Somebody: The Reckless Life and Remarkable Career of Marlon Brando|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vlF3ZW0RTQUC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=%22self-denigration,+and+wholly+incorrect%22#v=onepage&q=%22self-denigration%2C%20and%20wholly%20incorrect%22&f=false|accessdate=November 12, 2016|isbn=9780571278787|date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> Kanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented, \"Christ! It was like a furnace door opening\u2014the heat came off the screen. I don't know another actor who could do that.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} During the filming of ''Julius Caesar'', Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of \"subversives\" to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC). By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in ''On The Waterfront''. \"None of us is perfect,\" he later wrote in his memoir, \"and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 1953, Brando also starred in ''[[The Wild One]]'', riding his own [[Triumph Thunderbird]] 6T motorcycle. Triumph's importers were ambivalent at the exposure, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town. The film was criticized for its perceived gratuitous violence at the time, with ''Time'' stating, \"The effect of the movie is not to throw light on the public problem, but to shoot adrenaline through the moviegoer's veins.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Brando allegedly did not see eye to eye with the Hungarian director [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek]] and did not get on with costar [[Lee Marvin]].\n\nTo Brando's expressed puzzlement, the movie inspired teen rebellion and made him a role model to the nascent rock-and-roll generation and future stars such as [[James Dean]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. After the movie's release, the sales of [[leather jacket]]s and blue [[jeans]] skyrocketed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Reflecting on the movie in his autobiography, Brando concluded that it had not aged very well but said:\n\n{{quote|More than most parts I've played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned.

That's exactly how I've felt all my life.<ref>Brando and Lindsey 1994, p. 178</ref>}}\n\nLater that same year, Brando starred in [[Lee Falk]]'s production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' in Boston. Falk was proud to tell people that Brando turned down an offer of $10,000 per week on Broadway, in favor of working in his production in [[Boston]], for less than $500 per week.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n====''On the Waterfront''====\nIn 1954, Brando starred in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a [[crime drama film]] about union violence and [[corruption]] among [[longshoremen]]. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and written by [[Budd Schulberg]]; it also starred [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]] and, in her film debut, [[Eva Marie Saint]]. When initially offered the role, Brando\u2014still stung by Kazan's testimony to HUAC\u2014demurred and the part of Terry Malloy nearly went to [[Frank Sinatra]]. According to biographer Stefan Kanfer, the director believed that Sinatra, who grew up in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] (where the film takes place and was shot), would work as Malloy, but eventually producer [[Sam Spiegel]] wooed Brando to the part, signing him for $100,000. \"Kazan made no protest because, he subsequently confessed, 'I always preferred Brando to anybody.'\"<ref name=\"Kanfer2011\">Kanfer 2008, p. 125.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eva marie saint marlon brando waterfront 10.jpg|thumb|Brando with [[Eva Marie Saint]] in the trailer for ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954).]]\nBrando won the Oscar for his role as [[Irish-American]] stevedore Terry Malloy in ''[[On the Waterfront]]''. His performance, spurred on by his rapport with Eva Marie Saint and Kazan's direction, was praised as a ''tour de force''. For the scene in which Terry laments his failings, saying ''I coulda been a contender'', he convinced Kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic. Schulberg's script had Brando acting the entire scene with his character being held at gunpoint by his brother Charlie, played by [[Rod Steiger]]. Brando insisted on gently pushing away the gun, saying that Terry would never believe that his brother would pull the trigger and doubting that he could continue his speech while fearing a gun on him. Kazan let Brando improvise and later expressed deep admiration for Brando's instinctive understanding, saying:\n\n{{quote|what was extraordinary about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior. What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress? Who else could read \"Oh, Charlie!\" in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests the terrific depth of pain?&nbsp;...

Much later, it turned up at a London auction house, which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereabouts.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Box office successes and directorial debut: 1954\u20131959===\nFollowing ''On the Waterfront'', Brando remained a top box office draw, but critics increasingly felt his performances were half-hearted, lacking the intensity and commitment found in his earlier work, especially in his work with Kazan. He portrayed [[Napoleon]] in the 1954 film ''[[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (film)|D\u00e9sir\u00e9e]]''. According to co-star [[Jean Simmons]], Brando's contract forced him to star in the movie. He put little effort into the role, claiming he didn't like the script, and later dismissed the entire movie as \"superficial and dismal\". Brando was especially contemptuous of director [[Henry Koster]].\n\nBrando and Simmons were paired together again in the film adaptation of the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955). ''Guys and Dolls'' would be Brando's first and last musical role. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' found the picture \"false to the original in its feeling\", remarking that Brando \"sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat.\" Appearing in [[Edward R. Murrow|Edward Murrow]]'s ''Person to Person'' interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called \"pretty terrible.\" In the 1965 documentary ''Meet Marlon Brando'', he revealed that the final product heard in the movie was a result of countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, \"I couldn't hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins&nbsp;... They sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when I mouthed it in front of the camera, I nearly asphyxiated myself\". Relations between Brando and costar [[Frank Sinatra]] were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing: \"The two men were diametrical opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself.\" Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, \"Don't give me any of that Actors Studio shit.\" Brando later quipped, \"Frank is the kind of guy, when he dies, he's going to heaven and give God a hard time for making him bald.\" Frank Sinatra called Brando \"the world's most overrated actor\", and referred to him as \"mumbles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2014/06/07/10-strange-stories-about-frank-sinatra/|title=10 Strange Stories About Frank Sinatra|author=Nolan Moore|date=June 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202103130/http://listverse.com/2014/06/07/10-strange-stories-about-frank-sinatra/|archivedate=February 2, 2017}}</ref> The film was commercially though not critically successful, costing $5.5&nbsp;million to make and grossing $13&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nBrando played Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar [[Japan]], in ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' (1956). [[Pauline Kael]] was not particularly impressed by the movie, but noted \"Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, and he looks as if he's enjoying the stunt\u2014talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs. He's harmlessly genial (and he is certainly missed when he's offscreen), though the fey, roguish role doesn't allow him to do what he's great at and it's possible that he's less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been.\" In ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957) he appeared as a United States Air Force officer. ''[[Newsweek]]'' found the film a \"dull tale of the meeting of the twain\", but it was nevertheless a box-office success. According to Stefan Kanfer's biography of the actor, Brando's manager Jay Kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to Brando, which put him in the millionaire category. The movie was controversial due to openly discussing [[interracial marriage]], but proved a great success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, with Brando being nominated for Best Actor. The film went on to win four Academy Awards. ''Teahouse'' and ''Sayonara'' were the first in a string of films Brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages, and he formed a partnership with Paramount to establish his own production company called Pennebaker, its declared purpose to develop films that contained \"social value that would improve the world.\" The name was a tribute in honor of his mother, who had died in 1954. By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', \"She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring.\" Brando appointed his father to run Pennebaker. In the same A&E special, George Englund claims that Brando gave his father the job because \"it gave Marlon a chance to take shots at him, to demean and diminish him\".\n\nIn 1958, Brando appeared in ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'', dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film is based on the novel by [[Irwin Shaw]], and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, \"The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about [[Nazism]]; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a clich\u00e9 of evil&nbsp;... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled.\" Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent [[David Schoenbrun]] and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating \"Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation.\" ''The Young Lions'' also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival [[Montgomery Clift]] (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in ''[[The Fugitive Kind]]'' (1960) opposite [[Anna Magnani]]. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' had been, with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' labeling Williams's personae \"psychologically sick or just plain ugly\" and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' calling it a \"cornpone melodrama\".\n\n===''One-Eyed Jacks'' and ''Mutiny on the Bounty''===\n[[File:Pina Pellicer and Marlon Brando publicity photo One-Eyed Jacks (1961).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marlon Brando with [[Pina Pellicer]] in a publicity photo for ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961).]]\nIn 1961, Brando made his directorial debut in the western ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''. The picture was originally directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], but he was fired early in the production. Paramount then made Brando the director. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and [[Karl Malden]] plays his partner \"Dad\" Longworth. The supporting cast features [[Katy Jurado]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], and [[Slim Pickens]]. Brando's penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars. Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually took control of the film. Brando later wrote, \"Paramount said it didn't like my version of the story; I'd had everyone lie except Karl Malden. The studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar, too. By then, I was bored with the whole project and walked away from it.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} ''One-Eyed Jacks'' was poorly reviewed by critics. While the film did solid business, it ran so over budget that it lost money.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = One-Eyed Jacks 1961 (15).jpg\n| width1    =\n| caption1  = \n| alt1      = Brando and Pina Pellicer staring at each other in in One-Eyed Jacks.\n| image2    = One-Eyed Jacks 1961 (9).jpg\n| width2    =\n| caption2  = Scenes of Brando and Pina Pellicer in the film ''One-Eyed Jacks'' (1961).\n| alt2      = Pina Pellicer kissing Marlon Brando. \n}}\nBrando's revulsion with the film industry reportedly boiled over on the set of his next film, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s [[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|remake of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'']], which was filmed in [[Tahiti]]. The actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production. On June 16, 1962, ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' ran an article by Bill Davidson with the headline \"Six million dollars down the drain: the mutiny of Marlon Brando\". ''Mutiny'' director [[Lewis Milestone]] claimed that the executives \"deserve what they get when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture.\" '' Mutiny on the Bounty'' nearly capsized MGM and, while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than Brando's behavior, the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear Brando's difficult reputation. Critics also began taking note of his fluctuating weight.\n\n===Box office decline: 1963\u20131971===\nDistracted by his personal life and becoming disillusioned with his career, Brando began to view acting as a means to a financial end. Critics protested when he started accepting roles in films many perceived as being beneath his talent, or criticized him for failing to live up to the better roles. Previously only signing short-term deals with film studios, in 1961 Brando uncharacteristically signed a five-picture deal with Universal Studios that would haunt him for the rest of the decade. ''[[The Ugly American (film)|The Ugly American]]'' (1963) was the first of these films. Based on the 1958 novel of the same title that Pennebaker had optioned, the film, which featured Brando's sister Jocelyn, was rated fairly positively but died at the box office. Brando was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. All of Brando's other Universal films during this period, including ''[[Bedtime Story (1964 film)|Bedtime Story]]'' (1964), ''[[The Appaloosa]]'' (1966), ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Night of the Following Day]]'' (1969), were also critical and commercial flops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marlon-brando-declines-best-actor-oscar|title=Marlon Brando declines Best Actor Oscar \u2013 Mar 27, 1973|publisher=HISTORY.com|access-date=August 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816191215/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marlon-brando-declines-best-actor-oscar|archivedate=August 16, 2017}}</ref> ''Countess'' in particular was a disappointment for Brando, who had looked forward to working with one of his heroes, director [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The experience turned out to be an unhappy one; Brando was horrified at Chaplin's didactic style of direction and his authoritarian approach. Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller ''[[Morituri (1965 film)|Morituri]]'' in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience.\n\nBrando acknowledged his professional decline, writing later, \"Some of the films I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like ''The Night of the Following Day'', I made only for the money; others, like ''[[Candy (1968 film)|Candy]]'', I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down&nbsp;... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years.\" ''Candy'' was especially appalling for many; a 1968 [[Bedroom farce|sex farce]] film directed by [[Christian Marquand]] and based on the 1958 novel by [[Terry Southern]], the film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by [[Ewa Aulin]]. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' observed: \"Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents.\" In the March 1966 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando \"was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap\", but now Brando and others like him had become \"buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations.\" In an earlier review of ''The Appaloosa'' in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was \"trapped in another dog of a movie&nbsp;... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner.\" Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film ''[[Listen to Me Marlon]]'', \"They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot.\"{{Cite quote|date=February 2016}}\n\nBrando portrayed a repressed [[gay]] army officer in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'', directed by [[John Huston]] and costarring [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. The role turned out as one of his most acclaimed in years, with Stanley Crouch marveling, \"Brando's main achievement was to portray the taciturn but stoic gloom of those pulverized by circumstances.\"<ref>Crouch, Stanley.

Another notable film was ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'' (1966), which paired the actor with [[Arthur Penn]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Robert Redford]]. The film deals with themes of racism, sexual revolution, small-town corruption, and vigilantism. The film was received mostly positively.\n\nBrando cited ''[[Burn!]]'' (1969) as his personal favorite of the films he had made, writing in his autobiography, \"I think I did some of the best acting I've ever done in that picture, but few people came to see it.\" Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, [[Gillo Pontecorvo]], was the best director he had ever worked with next to Kazan and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]. Brando also detailed his clashes with Pontecorvo on the set and how \"we nearly killed each other.\" Loosely based on events in the history of Guadeloupe, the film got a hostile reception from critics. In 1971, [[Michael Winner]] directed him in the British horror film ''[[The Nightcomers]]'' with [[Stephanie Beacham]], [[Thora Hird]], [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Anna Palk]]. It is a prequel to ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'', which later became the 1961 film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]''.

He bested Brando at the [[1972 New York Film Critics Circle Awards]].) [[Albert S. Ruddy]], whom Paramount assigned to produce the film, agreed with the choice of Brando. However, Paramount studio heads were opposed to casting Brando due to his reputation for difficulty and his long string of box office flops. Brando also had ''One-Eyed Jacks'' working against him, a troubled production that lost money for Paramount when it was released in 1961. Paramount Pictures President [[Stanley R. Jaffe|Stanley Jaffe]] told an exasperated Coppola, \"As long as I'm president of this studio, Marlon Brando will not be in this picture, and I will no longer allow you to discuss it.\"<ref>Lebo 2005, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\nJaffe eventually set three conditions for the casting of Brando: That he would have to take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped \"make-up\" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, \"I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully.\" Eventually, [[Charles Bluhdorn]], the president of Paramount parent [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]], was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, \"What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?\" Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10&nbsp;million over a $10&nbsp;million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60&nbsp;million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. \"That $100,000 cost him $11&nbsp;million,\" Evans claimed.<ref>Grobel 2000, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn a 1994 interview that can be found on the Academy of Achievement website, Coppola insisted, \"''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired.\" When word of this reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir, \"I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision, though Francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do.\" In a 2010 television interview with [[Larry King]], [[Al Pacino]] also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of [[Michael Corleone]] in the movie\u2014despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him. Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included Pacino, [[Robert Duvall]], [[James Caan]], and [[Diane Keaton]].

'I used to meet with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in Cromwell's Drugstore, and if we mentioned his name once, we mentioned it 25 times in a day.' Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'\"\n\nBrando's performance was glowingly reviewed by critics. \"I thought it would be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys [[Edward G. Robinson]] played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected,\" Brando recalled in his autobiography. \"Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike [[Al Capone]], who beat up people with baseball bats.\" Duvall later marveled to A&E's ''Biography'', \"He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word ''action''. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. ''Cut!'' It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that.\" Brando won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after [[George C. Scott]] for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending indigenous American rights activist [[Sacheen Littlefeather]], who appeared in full [[Apache]] attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of indigenous Americans by Hollywood and television.<ref>[https://www.today.com/popculture/american-indians-mourn-brandos-death-wbna5354208 \"American Indians mourn Brando's death-Marlon Brando (1924\u20132004).\"]  MSNBC, July 2, 2004.

Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant, which it was alleged was not consensual,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/last-tango-in-paris-director-says-maria-schneider-butter-scene-not-consensual|title=Last Tango in Paris director suggests Maria Schneider 'butter rape' scene not consensual|first=Bonnie|last=Malkin|date=December 4, 2016|website=the Guardian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207193810/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/last-tango-in-paris-director-says-maria-schneider-butter-scene-not-consensual|archivedate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> and Paul's angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife.

Brando slept in Cox's pajamas and wrenched his ashes from his widow. She was going to sue for their return, but finally said \"I think Marlon needs the ashes more than I do.\"<ref>Bosworth, Patricia ''Marlon Brando'', Viking 2001 p198</ref>\n\n===Late 1970s===\nIn 1976, Brando appeared in ''[[The Missouri Breaks]]'' with his friend [[Jack Nicholson]]. The movie also reunited the actor with director Arthur Penn. As biographer Stefan Kanfer describes, Penn had difficulty controlling Brando, who seemed intent on going over the top with his border-ruffian-turned-contract-killer Robert E. Lee Clayton: \"Marlon made him a cross-dressing [[psychopath]]. Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style. He speaks in an Irish accent for no apparent reason. Over the next hour, also for no apparent reason, Clayton assumes the intonation of a British upper-class twit and an elderly frontier woman, complete with a [[granny dress]] and matching bonnet. Penn, who believed in letting actors do their thing, indulged Marlon all the way.\"{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=269}} Critics were unkind, with ''[[The Observer]]'' calling Brando's performance \"one of the most extravagant displays of ''grandedamerie'' since [[Sarah Bernhardt]]\",{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=270}} while ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' complained, \"Marlon Brando at fifty-two has the sloppy belly of a sixty-two-year-old, the white hair of a seventy-two-year-old, and the lack of discipline of a precocious twelve-year-old.\"{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=270}} However, Kanfer noted: \"Even though his late work was met with disapproval, a re-examination shows that often, in the middle of the most pedestrian scene, there would be a sudden, luminous occurrence, a flash of the old Marlon that showed how capable he remained.\"{{sfn|Kanfer|2008|p=270}}\n\nIn 1978, Brando narrated the English version of ''[[Raoni]]'', a French-Belgian documentary film directed by [[Jean-Pierre Dutilleux]] and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of [[Raoni Metuktire]] and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil. Brando portrayed [[Superman]]'s father [[Jor-El]] in the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of ''Superman'' that he was paid $3.7&nbsp;million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, ''[[Superman II]]'', but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. \"I asked for my usual percentage,\" he recollected in his memoir, \"but they refused, and so did I.\" However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 re-cut of the film, ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' and in the 2006 \"loose sequel\" ''[[Superman Returns]]'', in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two ''Superman'' films was remastered for a scene in the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1979, he made a rare television appearance in the miniseries ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'', portraying [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]; he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie|Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for his performance.\n\nBrando starred as [[Colonel Kurtz|Colonel Walter E. Kurtz]] in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979). He plays a highly decorated U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military as much as the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1&nbsp;million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as [[Eleanor Coppola]]'s documentary ''Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'' documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, [[Martin Sheen]] suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: \"He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me that he was going to get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was ''so'' fat, he was very, very shy about it&nbsp;... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way.\" Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer [[Fred Roos]]: \"The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage&nbsp;... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging\u2014and yet he's getting paid for it.\"\n\nUpon release, ''Apocalypse Now'' earned critical acclaim, as did Brando's performance. His whispering of Kurtz's final words ''\"The horror! The horror!\"'', has become particularly famous. [[Roger Ebert]], writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', defended the movie's controversial ''denouement'', opining that the ending, \"with Brando's fuzzy, brooding monologues and the final violence, feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Apocalypse Now |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/apocalypse-now-1979 |website=Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n===Later work===\nAfter appearing as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's ''[[The Formula (1980 film)|The Formula]]'', which was poorly received critically, Brando announced his retirement from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in ''[[A Dry White Season]]'', based on [[Andr\u00e9 Brink]]'s 1979 [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director [[Euzhan Palcy]] over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance in an interview with [[Connie Chung]] to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy \"had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best.\" Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival.\n\nBrando scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]].'' In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, \"There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts\u2014but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in ''The Freshman''?\"<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-freshman-1990 \"The Freshman\" ''RogerEbert.com'', July 27, 1990.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203000149/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-freshman-1990 |date=February 3, 2017 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, \"Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates ''The Freshman'' from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Review: 'The Freshman' |url=https://variety.com/1989/film/reviews/the-freshman-1200428215/ |magazine=Variety |date=December 31, 1989 |access-date=February 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106111125/http://variety.com/1989/film/reviews/the-freshman-1200428215/ |archivedate=January 6, 2017  }}</ref> Brando also starred alongside his friend [[Johnny Depp]] in the box office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'' (1995) and in Depp's controversial ''[[The Brave (film)|The Brave]]'' (1997), which was never released in the United States.\n\nLater performances, such as his appearance in ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'' (1992) (for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Raspberry]] as \"Worst Supporting Actor\"), ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'' (in which he won a \"Worst Supporting Actor\" Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in ''[[Free Money (film)|Free Money]]'' (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. ''The Island of Dr. Moreau'' screenwriter [[Ron Hutchinson (screenwriter)|Ron Hutchinson]] would later say in his memoir, ''Clinging to the Iceberg: Writing for a Living on the Stage and in Hollywood'' (2017), that Brando sabotaged the film's production by feuding and refusing to cooperate with his colleagues and the film crew.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/16/marlon-brando-monster-sabotaged-my-film-island-of-dr-moreau|title=Marlon Brando was my idol but he turned into a monster.

In the film, in which he portrays a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]], he starred with [[Robert De Niro]].\n\nAfter Brando's death, the novel ''Fan-Tan'' was released.

He gained a great deal of weight in the 1970s and by the early to mid-1990s he weighed over {{convert|300|lb|kg}} and suffered from [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]]. He had a history of weight fluctuation throughout his career that, by and large, he attributed to his years of stress-related overeating followed by compensatory dieting. He also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd demands. He also dabbled with some innovation in his last years. He had several patents issued in his name from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]], all of which involve a method of tensioning [[drumhead]]s, in June 2002 \u2013 November 2004. (For example, see {{US Patent|6812392}} and its equivalents).{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 2004, Brando recorded voice tracks for the character Mrs. Sour in the unreleased animated film ''[[Big Bug Man]]''. This was his last role and his only role as a female character.<ref name=\"Bigbugman\"/>\n\nA longtime close friend of entertainer [[Michael Jackson]], he paid regular visits to his [[Neverland Ranch]], resting there for weeks at a time. Brando also participated in the singer's two-day solo career [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration|30th-anniversary celebration concerts]] in 2001, and starred in his 13-minute-long music video, \"[[You Rock My World#Music video|You Rock My World]],\" in the same year.\n\nThe actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's bodyguard and assistant for several years, and was a friend of the singer. \"The last time my father left his house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time, it was with Michael Jackson\", Miko stated. \"He loved it ...

Intense emotions buried inside you can come smoking out the back of your head, and I suppose in terms of psychodrama this can be helpful. In hindsight, I guess my emotional insecurity as a child\u2014the frustrations of not being allowed to be who I was, of wanting love and not being able to get it, of realizing that I was of no value\u2014may have helped me as an actor, at least in a small way. It probably gave me a certain intensity that most people don't have.{{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}\n\nHe also confessed that, while having great admiration for the theater, he did not return to it after his initial success primarily because the work left him drained emotionally:\n\n{{quote|What I remember most about ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' was the emotional grind of acting in it six nights and two afternoons. Try to imagine what it was like walking on stage at 8:30 every night having to yell, scream, cry, break dishes, kick the furniture, punch the walls and ''experience'' the same intense, wrenching emotions night after night, trying each time to evoke in audiences the same emotions I felt. It was exhausting.{{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}\n\nBrando repeatedly credited Stella Adler and her understanding of the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski acting technique]] for bringing realism to American cinema, but also added:\n\n{{quote|This school of acting served the American theater and motion pictures well, but it was restricting. The American theater has never been able to present [[Shakespeare]] or classical drama of any kind satisfactorily. We simply do not have the style, the regard for the language or the cultural disposition ... You cannot mumble in Shakespeare. You cannot improvise, and you are required to adhere strictly to the text. The English theater has a sense of language that we do not recognize ... In the United States the English language has developed almost into a patois.{{sfn|Brando|Lindsey|1994}}{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}\n\nIn the 2015 documentary ''[[Listen to Me Marlon]]'', Brando shared his thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, \"That's a tough scene to play. You have to make 'em believe that you are dying ... Try to think of the most intimate moment you've ever had in your life.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Brando's favorite actors were [[Spencer Tracy]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Fredric March]], [[James Cagney]] and [[Paul Muni]].

This article gives an overview of surnames around the world.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==English-speaking countries==\n{{main article|Surname#Typology}}\n{{further|English name|Canadian name}}\n\n===Ireland, Isle of Man, and Scotland===\n{{main article|Gaelic surname}}\n{{see also|Irish name|Manx surnames|Scottish surnames}}\n{{see also|Irish people#Surnames}}\n\n==Spanish-speaking countries==\n{{main article|Surname#Spanish-speaking world}}\n{{further|Spanish naming customs|Naming customs of Hispanic America}}\n\n===Argentina===\nIn [[Argentina]], normally only one family name, the father's paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries. However, it is possible to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if ''Ana Laura Melachenko'' and ''Emanuel Dar\u00edo Guerrero'' had a daughter named ''Adabel Anah\u00ed'', her full name could be ''[[Adabel Guerrero|Adabel Anah\u00ed Guerrero Melachenko]]''. Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their [[Maiden and married names|birth family names]] instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining \"''de''\" and her husband's surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become ''Paula Segovia de Cossia'' or ''Paula Cossia''.\n\nThere are some province offices where a married woman can use only her birth name, and some others where she has to use the complete name, for legal purposes. The Argentine Civilian Code states both uses are correct, but police offices and passports are issued with the complete name. Today most women prefer to maintain their birth name given that \"de\" can be interpreted as meaning they belong to their husbands.\n\nWhen Eva Duarte married [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]], she could be addressed as Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n, but the preferred style was [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], or the familiar and affectionate ''Evita'' (little Eva).\n\nCombined names come from old traditional families and are considered one last name, but are rare. Although Argentina is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country, it is also composed of other [[demographics of Argentina|varied European influences]], such as Italian, French, Russian, German, etc.\n\nChildren typically use their fathers' last names only. Some state offices have started to use both last names, in the traditional father then mother order, to reduce the risk of a person being mistaken for others using the same name combinations, e.g. if Eva Duarte and Juan Per\u00f3n had a child named Juan, he might be misidentified if he were called ''Juan Per\u00f3n'', but not if he was known as Juan Per\u00f3n Duarte.\n\nIn early 2008, some new legislation is under consideration that will place the mother's last name ahead the father's last name, as it is done in [[Married and maiden names#Portuguese-speaking world|Portuguese-speaking]] countries and only optionally in Spain, despite Argentina being a Spanish-speaking country.\n\n===Chile===\nIn [[Chile]], marriage has no effect at all on either of the spouses' names, so people keep their birth names for all their life, no matter how many times marital status, theirs or that of their parents, may change. However, in some upper-class circles or in older couples, even though considered to be old-fashioned, it is still customary for a wife to use her husband's name as reference, as in \"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s de Ram\u00edrez\" (literally Lady Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s (wife) of Ram\u00edrez).\n\nChildren will always bear the surname of the father followed by that of the mother, but if there is no known father and the mother is single, the children can bear either both of her mother's surnames or the mother's first surname followed by any of the surnames of the mother's parents or grandparents, or the child may bear the mother's first surname twice in a row.\n\n{{see also|#The Philippines}}\n\n==French-speaking countries==\nIvory coast\n\n==German-speaking countries==\n{{details|German family name etymology}}\n\nThere are about 1,000,000{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} different family names in German. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. Hyphenations notwithstanding, they mostly consist of a single word; in those rare cases where the family name is linked to the given names by particles such as ''von'' or ''zu'', they usually indicate [[nobility|noble]] [[ancestry]]. Not all noble families used these names (see [[Riedesel]]), while some farm families, particularly in [[Westphalia]], used the particle ''von'' or ''zu'' followed by their farm or former farm's name as a family name (see ''Meyer zu Erpen'').\n\nFamily names in German-speaking countries are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: in parts of Austria and Bavaria and the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic-speaking]] areas, the family name is regularly put in front of the first given name. Also in many \u2013 especially [[rural]] \u2013 parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]]: ''R\u00fcters Erich'', for example, would be Erich of the R\u00fcter family.\n\nIn Germany today, upon marriage, both partners can choose to keep their birth name or choose either partner's name as the common name. In the latter case the partner whose name wasn't chosen can keep his birth name hyphenated to the new name (e.g. ''Schmidt'' and ''Meyer'' choose to marry under the name ''Meyer''. The former ''Schmidt'' can choose to be called ''Meyer'', ''Schmidt-Meyer'' or ''Meyer-Schmidt''), but any children will only get the single common name. In the case that both partners keep their birth name they must decide on one of the two family names for all their future children. ([[German name]])\n\nChanging one's family name for reasons other than marriage, divorce or adoption is possible only if the application is approved by the responsible government agency. Permission will usually be granted if:\n* the old name is very common and leads to confusion;\n* the old name is overly long or very difficult to spell or pronounce (especially with names of former nobility and of citizens with non-German ancestry); or\n* the old name has negative connotations or is easily ridiculed.\n\nOtherwise, name changes will normally not be granted.\n\n==Portuguese-speaking countries==\n{{main article|Surname#Portuguese-speaking countries}}\n{{further|Portuguese name}}\n\n==Dutch-speaking countries==\n{{Main article|Dutch name}}\nThe '''Netherlands''' and '''Belgium''' ([[Flanders]])\n\n==Scandinavia==\n{{further|Scandinavian family name etymology}}\nIn Scandinavia, family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is ''-sen'', as in ''Karlsen''. Names ending with ''dotter/datter'' (daughter), such as ''Olofsdotter'', are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's father does not have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familiestyrelsen.dk/navne/ |title=Familiestyrelsen: Navne |publisher=Familiestyrelsen.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlss\u00f8n or Annas\u00f8n and a daughter Karlsdatter or Annasdatter.\n\nBefore the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather (e.g. Earl [[Birger jarl|Birger Magnusson]] ''[[Folkung]]e''{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} <!-- He was never named like that during his lifetime. -->) or to the family's [[coat of arms]] (e.g. King [[Gustav Vasa|Gustav Eriksson]] ''[[House of Vasa|Vasa]]''). In many surviving family noble names, such as ''Silfversparre'' (\"silver chevron\"; in modern spelling, ''Silver-'') or ''Stiernhielm'' (\"star-helmet\"; in modernized spelling, ''stj\u00e4rnhj\u00e4lm''), the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged. (Some names from relatively modern times also use archaic or otherwise aberrant spelling as a stylistic trait; e.g. ''-quist'' instead of standard ''-kvist'' \"twig\" or ''-gr\u00e9n'' instead of standard ''-gren'', \"branch\".)\n\nLater on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish ''Bergman'' (\"mountain man\"), ''Holmberg'' (\"island mountain\"), ''Lindgren'' (\"linden branch\"), ''Sandstr\u00f6m'' (\"sand stream\") and ''\u00c5kerlund'' (\"field meadow\") were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.\nAnother common practice was to adopt one's place of origin as a middle or surname.\n\nEven more important a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, to develop a system under which each individual had a \"stable\" name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This is part of the origin, in this part of the world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a change of address, and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father's name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. [[Einar Gerhardsen]], the Norwegian [[prime minister]], used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many [[working class|working-class]] families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.\n\nThese names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of last names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffixes like ''-b\u00f8'', ''-rud'', ''-heim/-um'', ''-land'' or ''-set'' (these being examples from Norway). In Denmark, the most common suffix is ''-gaard'' \u2014 the modern spelling is ''g\u00e5rd'' in Danish and can be either ''g\u00e5rd'' or ''gard'' in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably ''[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'' (combined by the words \"kirke/kierke\" (= church) and \"gaard\" (= farm) meaning \"the farm located by the Church\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mydanishroots.com/surnames/deriving_from_a_farmstead.html |author=MyDanishRoots.com |title=Surnames deriving from a farmstead }}</ref> It is, however, a common misunderstanding that the name relates to its direct translation: churchyard/cemetery), but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners' domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.<ref>[http://www.nndata.no/home/jborgos/names.htm ''Norwegian Naming Patterns'' (Johan I. Borgos)]</ref>\n\nIn many cases, names were taken from the nature around them. In Norway, for instance, there is an abundance of surnames based on coastal geography, with suffixes like ''-strand'', ''-\u00f8y'', ''-holm'', ''-vik'', ''-fjord'' or ''-nes''. Like the names derived from farms, most of these family names reflected the family's place of residence at the time the family name was \"fixed\", however. A family name such as Swedish ''Dahlgren'' is derived from \"dahl\" meaning valley and \"gren\" meaning branch; or similarly ''[[Upvall family|Upvall]]'' meaning \"upper-valley\"; It depends on the Scandinavian country, language, and dialect.<ref>[http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/genealogy/naming.htm ''Norwegian Names'' (Norwegian-American Historical Association)]</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main article|Swedish name}}\n\nIn [[Scandinavia]] family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames in a similar fashion to that of the [[gentry]]. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish ''Bergman'' (\"mountain man\"), ''Holmberg'' (\"island mountain\"), ''Lindgren'' (\"linden branch\"), ''Sandstr\u00f6m'' (\"sand stream\") and ''\u00c5kerlund'' (\"field grove\") were quite frequent and remain common today.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main article|Finnish name}}\n\nFinland including [[Karelia]] and [[Estonia]] was the eastern part of The Kingdom of Sweden from its unification around 1100\u20131200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly [[Finnish People|Finnish]] (increasing) and [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] (decreasing) surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the ''Finnish'' in Finland: the [[West Finnish]] and the [[East Finnish]]. The surname traditions of ''Swedish-speaking'' farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of ''[[Sami people|Sami]]'' and ''[[Finnish Romani|Romani people]]'' have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.\n\nUntil the mid 20th Century, Finland was a predominantly [[agriculture|agrarian]] society, and the names of West [[Finnish people|Finns]] were based on their association with a particular area, [[farm]], or [[Smallholding|homestead]], e.g. ''Jaakko Jussila'' (\"Jaakko from the farm of Jussi\"). On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the [[Savonian people|Savonians]] pursued [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families, e.g. ''Ik\u00e4valko'', ''Termonen'', ''Pentik\u00e4inen''. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the name of the former or current place of living (e.g. ''Puumalainen'' < [[Puumala]]). In the East Finnish tradition, the women carried the family name of their fathers in female form (e.g. ''Puumalatar'' < ''Puumalainen''). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of the West-European surname tradition.\n\nIn Western Finland, agrarian names dominated, and the last name of the person was usually given according to the farm or holding they lived on. In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, the agrarian names were usually adopted as surnames. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes ''Ala-'' (Sub-) or ''Yl\u00e4-'' (Up-), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding. (e.g. ''Yli-Ojanper\u00e4'', ''Ala-Verronen''). The Swedish speaking farmers along the coast of \u00d6sterbotten usually used two surnames \u2013 one which pointed out the father's name (e.g. ''Eriksson'', ''Andersson'', ''Johansson'') and one which related to the farm or the land their family or bigger family owned or had some connection to (e.g. ''Holm'', ''Fant'', ''Westerg\u00e5rd'', ''Kloo''). So a full name could be ''Johan Karlsson Kvist'', for his daughter ''Elvira Johansdotter Kvist'', and when she married a man with the Ahlskog farm, Elvira kept the first surname Johansdotter but changed the second surname to her husbands (e.g. ''Elvira Johansdotter Ahlskog''). During the 20th century they started to drop the -son surname while they kept the second. So in Western Finland the Swedish speaking had names like ''Johan Varg'', ''Karl Viskas'', ''Sebastian Byskata'' and ''Elin Loo'', while the Swedes in Sweden at the other side of the Baltic Sea kept surnames ending with ''-son'' (e.g. ''Johan Eriksson'', ''Thor Andersson'', ''Anna-Karin Johansson'').\n\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced in south Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes, which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in the case of clergy) Latin surname. In the case of [[Swedish allotment system|enlisted soldiers]], the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process, and especially the political movement of [[fennicization]], caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings ''-o/\u00f6'', ''-nen'' (''Meri\u00f6'' < ''Meri'' \"sea\", ''Nieminen'' < ''Niemi'' \"point\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (''Paasivirta'' < ''H\u00e4llstr\u00f6m'').<ref>The whole section is based on the article Paikkala, S. [http://www.fennia.nu/artiklar/sukunimet_paikkala_sv.htm Sukunimet sukututkimuksessa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221055520/http://www.fennia.nu/artiklar/sukunimet_paikkala_sv.htm |date=2007-12-21 }}. Retrieved 11-6-2007. {{in lang|fi}}</ref>\n\nIn 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the German model. Every person is legally obligated to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. The Finnish married couple may adopt the name of either spouse, or either spouse (or both spouses) may decide to use a double name. The parents may choose either surname or the double surname for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname.<ref>[http://www.mol.fi/mol/fi/99_pdf/fi/04_maahanmuutto/07_aineistot_kirjasto/01_esitteet/tasarv/tasarv_eng.pdf Equality in Finland: Information for immigrants]</ref> All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or is in use by any person residing in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors if they can prove such claim.<ref>The information here is taken from the Finnish [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 ''Nimilaki (694/1985)] (Name Act). Retrieved 11-6-2007.</ref> Some immigrants have had difficulty naming their children, as they must choose from an approved list based on the family's household language.\n\nIn the Finnish language, both the root of the surname and the first name can be modified by [[consonant gradation]] regularly when inflected to a case.\n\n===Iceland===\n{{details|topic=Naming conventions of Iceland|Icelandic name}}\n\nIn [[Iceland]], most people have no family name; a person's last name is most commonly a patronymic, i.e. derived from the father's first name. For example, when a man called ''Karl'' has a daughter called ''Anna'' and a son called ''Magn\u00fas'', their full names will typically be ''Anna Karlsd\u00f3ttir'' (\"Karl's daughter\") and ''Magn\u00fas Karlsson'' (\"Karl's son\"). The name is not changed upon marriage.\n\n==Slavic world==\n{{main article|Slavic names|Slavic name suffixes|Eastern Slavic naming customs}}\n\nSlavic countries are noted for having masculine and feminine versions for many (but not all) of their names. In most countries the use of a feminine form is obligatory in official documents as well as in other communication, except for foreigners. In some countries only the male form figures in official use (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia), but in communication (speech, print) a feminine form is often used.\n\nIn '''Slovenia''' the last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used.\n\nIf the name has no suffix, it may or may not have a feminine version. Sometimes it has the ending changed (such as the addition of ''-a''). In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, suffixless names, such as those of German origin, are feminized by adding ''-ov\u00e1'' (for example, ''Schusterov\u00e1'').\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main article|Bulgarian name}}\n[[Bulgaria]]n names usually consist of three components \u2013 given name, patronymic (based on father's name), family name.\n\nGiven names have many variations, but the most common names have Christian/Greek (e.g. [[wikt:Maria|Maria]], [[wikt:Ivan|Ivan]], [[wikt:Christo|Christo]], Peter, [[wikt:Pavel|Pavel]]), [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] (Ognyan, [[wikt:Miroslav|Miroslav]], [[wikt:Tihomir|Tihomir]]) or [[Bulgars|Protobulgarian]] (Krum, [[wikt:Asparukh|Asparukh]]) (pre-Christian) origin.\nFather's names normally consist of the father's first name and the \"-ov\" (male) or \"-ova\" (female) or \"-ovi\" (plural) suffix.\n\nFamily names usually also end with the \"-ov\", \"-ev\" (male) or \"-ova\", \"-eva\" (female) or \"-ovi\", \"-evi\" (plural) suffix.\n\nIn many cases (depending on the name root) the suffixes can be also \"-ski\" (male and plural) or \"-ska\" (female); \"-ovski\", \"-evski\" (male and plural) or \"-ovska\", \"-evska\" (female); \"-in\" (male) or \"-ina\" (female) or \"-ini\" (plural); etc.\n\nThe meaning of the suffixes is similar to the English word \"of\", expressing membership in/belonging to a family.\nFor example, the family name Ivanova means a person belonging to the Ivanovi family.\n\nA father's name Petr*ov* means son of Peter.\n\nRegarding the different meaning of the suffixes, \"-ov\", \"-ev\"/\"-ova\", \"-eva\" are used for expressing relationship to the father and \"-in\"/\"-ina\" for relationship to the mother (often for orphans whose father is dead).\n\n===Czech Republic and Slovakia===\n{{Main article|Czech name|Slovak name}}\n\nNames of [[Czechs|Czech people]] consist of given name (''k\u0159estn\u00ed jm\u00e9no'') and surname (''p\u0159\u00edjmen\u00ed''). Usage of the second or middle name is not common. Feminine names are usually derived from masculine ones by a suffix ''-ov\u00e1'' (''Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1'') or ''-\u00e1'' for names being originally adjectives (''Vesel\u00e1''), sometimes with a little change of original name's ending (''Sedl\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1'' from ''Sedl\u00e1\u010dek'' or ''Svobodov\u00e1'' from ''Svoboda''). Women usually change their family names when they get married. The family names are usually [[noun]]s (''Svoboda'', ''Kr\u00e1l'', ''R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka'', ''Dvo\u0159\u00e1k'', ''Bene\u0161''), [[adjective]]s (''Novotn\u00fd'', ''\u010cern\u00fd'', ''Vesel\u00fd'') or past participles of [[verb]]s (''Posp\u00ed\u0161il''). There are also a couple of names with more complicated origin which are actually complete sentences (''Sko\u010ddopole'', ''Hrejsemnou'' or ''V\u00edt\u00e1mv\u00e1s''). The most common Czech family name is ''Nov\u00e1k'' / ''Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1''.\n\nIn addition, many Czechs and some Slovaks have German surnames due to mixing between the ethnic groups over the past thousand years. Deriving women's names from German and other foreign names is often problematic since foreign names do not suit [[Czech language]] rules, although most commonly ''-ov\u00e1'' is simply added (''Schmidtov\u00e1''; umlauts are often, but not always, dropped, e.g. ''M\u00fcllerov\u00e1''), or the German name is respelled with Czech spelling (''\u0160mitov\u00e1''). Hungarian names, which can be found fairly commonly among Slovaks, can also be either left unchanged (Hungarian ''Nagy'', fem. ''Nagyov\u00e1'') or respelled according to Czech/Slovak orthography (masc. ''Na\u010f'', fem. ''Na\u010fov\u00e1'').\n\n===Poland===\n{{Main article|Polish name}}\n\nIn Poland and most of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics. Thus, early surnames indicating occupation include ''Karczmarz'' (\"innkeeper\"), ''Kowal'' (\"blacksmith\"), \"Z\u0142otnik\" (\"gold smith\") and ''Bednarczyk'' (\"young cooper\"), while those indicating patronymic descent include ''Szczepaniak'' (\"Son of ''Szczepan''), ''J\u00f3zefowicz'' (\"Son of ''J\u00f3zef''), and ''Ka\u017amirkiewicz'' (\"Son of ''Kazimierz''\"). Similarly, early surnames like ''Mazur'' (\"the one from [[Masuria|Mazury]]\") indicated geographic origin, while ones like ''Nowak'' (\"the new one\"), ''Bia\u0142y'' (\"the pale one\"), and ''Wielgus'' (\"the big one\") indicated personal characteristics.\n\nIn the early 16th century, ( the [[Polish Renaissance]]), toponymic names became common, especially among the [[szlachta|nobility]]. Initially, the surnames were in a form of \"[first name] ''z'' (\"de\", \"of\") [location]\". Later, most surnames were changed to adjective forms, e.g. ''Jakub Wi\u015blicki'' (\"James of [[Wi\u015blica]]\") and ''[[Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki (disambiguation)|Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki]]'' (\"''Zbigniew'' of [[Olesnica|Ole\u015bnica]]\"), with masculine [[suffix (linguistics)|suffixes]] ''-ski'', ''-cki'', ''-dzki'' and ''-icz'' or respective feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', ''-dzka'' and ''-icz'' on the east of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Names formed this way are adjectives grammatically, and therefore change their form depending on sex; for example, ''Jan Kowalski'' and ''Maria Kowalska'' collectively use the plural ''Kowalscy''.\n\nNames with masculine suffixes ''-ski'', ''-cki'', and ''-dzki'', and corresponding feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', and ''-dzka'' became associated with noble origin. Many people from lower classes successively changed their surnames to fit this pattern. This produced many ''Kowalski''s, ''Bednarski''s, ''Kaczmarski''s and so on.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA separate class of surnames derive from the names of [[szlachta|noble clans]]. These are used either as separate names or the first part of a double-barrelled name. Thus, persons named ''Jan Nieczuja'' and ''Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki'' might be related. Similarly, after World War I and World War II, many members of [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground organizations]] adopted their [[nom de guerre|war-time pseudonyms]] as the first part of their surnames. ''Edward Rydz'' thus became [[Marshal of Poland]] ''[[Edward Smigly-Rydz|Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz]]'' and ''Zdzis\u0142aw Jeziora\u0144ski'' became ''[[Jan Nowak-Jezioranski|Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]]''.\n\n===Russia===\nA full [[Russians|Russian]] name consists of personal (given) name, patronymic, and family name (surname).\n\nMost Russian family names originated from patronymics, that is, father's name usually formed by adding the adjective suffix ''-ov(a)'' or ''-ev(a)''. Contemporary patronymics, however, have a substantive suffix ''-ich'' for masculine and the adjective suffix ''-na'' for feminine.\n\nFor example, the proverbial triad of most common Russian surnames follows:\n* ''Ivan'''ov''''' (son of Ivan),\n* ''Petr'''ov''''' (son of Peter),\n* ''Sidor'''ov''''' (son of Sidor).\n\nFeminine forms of these surnames have the ending ''-a'':\n* ''Ivan'''ova''''' (daughter of Ivan),\n* ''Petr'''ova''''' (daughter of Peter),\n* ''Sidor'''ova''''' (daughter of Sidor).\n\nSuch a pattern of name formation is not unique to Russia or even to the Eastern and Southern Slavs in general; quite common are also names derived from professions, places of origin, and personal characteristics, with various suffixes (e.g. ''-in(a)'' and ''-sky (-skaya)'').\n\nProfessions:\n* ''kuznets'' ([[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]) \u2192 ''Kuznetsov''\u2014''Kuznetsova''\n* ''portnoi'' ([[tailor]]) \u2192 ''Portnov''\u2014''Portnova''\n* ''pastukh'' ([[shepherd]]) \u2192 ''Pastukhov''\u2014''Pastukhova''.\n\nPlaces of origin:\n* ''Moskva'' (Moscow) \u2192 ''Moskvin''\u2014''Moskvina'', ''Moskovsky''\u2014''Moskovskaya'',\n* ''Smolensk'' \u2192 ''Smolensky''\u2014''Smolenskaya'',\n* ''Riazan'' \u2192 ''Riazanov''\u2014''Riazanova'', ''Riazantsev''\u2014''Riazantseva''.\n\nPersonal characteristics:\n* ''tolsty'' (stout, fat) \u2192 ''Tolstov''\u2014''Tolstova'', ''Tolstoy''\u2014''Tolstaya'',\n* ''nos'' (nose) \u2192 ''Nosov''\u2014''Nosova'',\n* ''sedoi'' (grey-haired or -headed) \u2192 ''Sedov''\u2014''Sedova''.\n\nA considerable number of \"artificial\" names exists, for example, those given to seminary graduates; such names were based on [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church]] or Christian virtues.\n\nGreat Orthodox Feasts:\n* ''rozhdestvo'' (Christmas) \u2192 ''Rozhdestvensky''\u2014''Rozhdestvenskaya'',\n* ''voskresenie'' (Resurrection) \u2192 ''Voskresensky''\u2014''Voskresenskaya'',\n* ''uspenie'' (Assumption) \u2192 ''Uspensky''\u2014''Uspenskaya''.\n\nChristian virtues:\n* ''philagathos'' (one who loves goodness) \u2192 ''Dobrolubov''\u2014''Dobrolubova'', ''Dobrolubsky''\u2014''Dobrolubskaya'',\n* ''philosophos'' (one who loves wisdom) \u2192 ''Lubomudrov''\u2014''Lubomudrova'',\n* ''theophilos'' (one who loves God) \u2192 ''Bogolubov''\u2014''Bogolubova''.\n\nMany freed serfs were given surnames after those of their former owners. For example, a serf of the [[Demidov]] family might be named ''Demidovsky'', which translates roughly as \"belonging to Demidov\" or \"one of Demidov's bunch\".\n\nGrammatically, Russian family names follow the same rules as other nouns or adjectives (names ending with ''-oy'', ''-aya'' are grammatically adjectives), with exceptions: some names do not change in different cases and have the same form in both genders (for example, ''Sedykh'', ''Lata'').\n\n===South Slavs===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n\n==== Endings in -i\u0107 and -i\u010d ====\nSurnames of some [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] groups such as [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], and [[Bosniaks]] traditionally end with the suffixes \"-i\u0107\" and \"-vi\u0107\" (often transliterated to English and other western languages as \"ic\", \"ich\", \"vic\" or \"vich\". The v is added in the case of a name to which \"-i\u0107\" is appended would otherwise end with a vowel, to avoid double vowels with the \"i\" in \"-i\u0107\".) These are a diminutive indicating descent i.e. \"son of\". In some cases the family name was derived from a profession (e.g. blacksmith \u2013 \"Kova\u010d\" \u2192 \"Kova\u010devi\u0107\").\n\nAn analogous ending is also common in [[Slovenia]]. As the [[Slovenian language]] does not have the softer consonant \"\u0107\", in Slovene words and names only \"\u010d\" is used. So that people from the former [[Yugoslavia]] need not change their names, in official documents \"\u0107\" is also allowed (as well as \"\u0110 / \u0111\"). Thus, one may have two surname variants, e.g.: Bo\u017ei\u010d, Tom\u0161i\u010d (Slovenian origin or assimilated) and Bo\u017ei\u0107, Tom\u0161i\u0107 (roots from the Serbo-Croat language continuum area). Slovene names ending in -i\u010d do not necessarily have a patrimonial origin.\n\nIn general family names in all of these countries follow this pattern with some family names being typically Serbian, some typically Croat and yet others being common throughout the whole linguistic region.\n\nChildren usually inherit their fathers' family name. In an older naming convention which was common in [[Serbia]] up until the mid-19th century, a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from the father's personal name, and the family name, as seen, for example, in the name of the language reformer [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]].\n\nOfficial family names do not have distinct male or female forms, except in Macedonia, though a somewhat archaic unofficial form of adding suffixes to family names to form female form persists, with ''-eva'', implying \"daughter of\" or \"female descendant of\" or ''-ka'', implying \"wife of\" or \"married to\". In Slovenia the feminine form of a surname (\"-eva\" or \"-ova\") is regularly used in non-official communication (speech, print), but not for official IDs or other legal documents.\n\nBosniak Muslim names follow the same formation pattern but are usually derived from proper names of Islamic origin, often combining archaic Islamic or feudal Turkish titles i.e. Mulaomerovi\u0107, \u0160abanovi\u0107, Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107, etc. Also related to Islamic influence is the prefix ''[[Hajji|Had\u017ei]]-'' found in some family names. Regardless of religion, this prefix was derived from the honorary title which a distinguished ancestor earned by making a pilgrimage to either Christian or Islamic holy places; Had\u017eibegi\u0107, being a Bosniak Muslim example, and Had\u017eianti\u0107 an Orthodox Christian one.\n\nIn [[Croatia]] where tribal affiliations persisted longer, [[Lika]], [[Herzegovina]] etc., originally a family name, came to signify practically all people living in one area, clan land or holding of the nobles. The [[\u0160ubi\u0107]] family owned land around the [[Zrin River]] in the Central Croatian region of [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]]. The surname became [[\u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]], the most famous being [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]].\n\nIn Montenegro and Herzegovina, family names came to signify all people living within one clan or [[Tribes of Montenegro|bratstvo]]. As there exists a strong tradition of inheriting personal names from grandparents to grandchildren, an additional patronymic usually using suffix ''-ov'' had to be introduced to make distinctions between two persons bearing the same personal name and the same family name and living within same area. A noted example is [[Marko Miljanov Popovi\u0107]], i.e. Marko, son of Miljan, from Popovi\u0107 family.\n\nDue to discriminatory laws in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], some Serb families of [[Vojvodina]] discarded the suffix ''-i\u0107'' in an attempt to mask their ethnicity and avoid heavy taxation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe prefix ''Pop-'' in Serbian names indicates descent from a priest, for example [[Gordana Pop Lazi\u0107]], i.e. descendant of Pop Laza.\n\nSome Serbian family names include prefixes of Turkish origin, such as ''Uzun-'' meaning tall, or ''Kara-'', black. Such names were derived from nicknames of family ancestors. A famous example is [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], descendants of \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, known as [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] or Black \u0110or\u0111e.\n\n====Endings -ov and -ski====\nAmong the [[Bulgarians]], another South Slavic people, the typical surname suffix is \"-ov\" (Ivanov, Kovachev), although other popular suffixes also exist.\n\nIn [[North Macedonia]], the most popular suffix today is \"-ski\".\n\n===Slovenia===\n[[Slovenes]] have a great variety of surnames, most of them differentiated according to region. Surnames ending in -i\u010d are by far less frequent than among Croats and Serbs. There are typically Slovenian surnames ending in -i\u010d, such as Bla\u017ei\u010d, Stani\u010d, [[Maru\u0161i\u010d]]. Many Slovenian surnames, especially in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], end in -\u010di\u010d (Gregor\u010di\u010d, Kocijan\u010di\u010d, Miklav\u010di\u010d, etc.), which is uncommon for other South Slavic peoples (except the neighboring Croats, e.g. Kova\u010di\u0107, Jela\u010di\u0107, Kranj\u010di\u0107, etc.). On the other hand, surname endings in -ski and -ov are rare, they can denote a noble origin (especially for the -ski, if it completes a toponym) or a foreign (mostly Czech) origin. One of the most typical Slovene surname endings is -nik (Rupnik, Pu\u010dnik, Ple\u010dnik, Poga\u010dnik, Podobnik) and other used surname endings are -lin (Pavlin, Mehlin, Ahlin, Ferlin), -ar (Mlakar, Ravnikar, Smrekar Tisnikar) and -lj (Rugelj, Pucelj, Bagatelj, Bricelj). Many Slovenian surnames are linked to Medieval rural settlement patterns. Surnames like [[Novak]] (literally, \"the new one\") or Hribar (from ''hrib'', hill) were given to the peasants settled in newly established farms, usually in high mountains. Peasant families were also named according to the owner of the land which they cultivated: thus, the surname Kralj (King) or Cesar (Emperor) was given to those working on royal estates, \u0160kof (Bishop) or Vidmar to those working on ecclesiastical lands, etc. Many Slovenian surnames are named after animals (Medved \u2013 bear, Volk, Vovk or Vouk \u2013 wolf, Golob \u2013 pigeon, Strnad - yellowhammer, Orel \u2013 eagle, Lisjak \u2013 fox, or Zajec \u2013 rabbit, etc.) or plants P\u0161enica - wheat, Slak - bindweed, Hrast - oak, etc. Many are named after neighbouring peoples: [[Horvat]], Hrovat, or Hrovatin (Croat), Furlan ([[Friulian language|Friulian]]), Nemec (German), Lah (Italian), Vogrin, Vogri\u010d or Vogrin\u010di\u010d (Hungarian), Vo\u0161njak (Bosnian), \u010ceh (Czech), Turk (Turk), or different Slovene regions: Kranjc, Kranjec or Krajnc (from [[Carniola]]), Kra\u0161evec (from the [[Karst Plateau|Kras]]), Koro\u0161ec (from [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]), Ko\u010devar or Ho\u010devar (from the [[Gottschee|Gottschee county]]).\n\n=====Use of feminine surnames in Slovenia=====\nIn '''Slovenia''' last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used. Examples: Novak (m.) & Novakova (f.), Kralj (m.) & Kraljeva (f.), Mali (m.) & Malijeva (f.). Usually surenames on -ova are used together with the title/gender: gospa Novakova (Mrs. Novakova), gospa Kraljeva (Mrs. Kraljeva), gospodi\u010dna Malijeva (Miss Malijeva, if unmarried), etc or with the name.  So we have Maja Novak on the ID card and Novakova Maja (extremely rarely Maja Novak'''ova''') in communication; Tja\u0161a Mali and Malijeva Tja\u0161a (rarely Tja\u0161a Malij'''eva'''); respectively. Diminutive forms of last names for females are also available: Novakovka, Kraljevka. As for pronunciation, in Slovenian there is some leeway regarding accentuation. Depending on the region or local usage, you may have either N\u00f3vak & N\u00f3vakova or, more frequently, Nov\u00e1k & Nov\u00e1kova. Accent marks are normally not used.\n\n{{further|Bulgarian name|Croatian name|Serbian name|Macedonian names}}\n\n===Ukraine and Belarus===\n{{Main article|Ukrainian name}}\n\nUkrainian and Belarusian names evolved from the same [[Old East Slavic]] and [[Ruthenian language]] (western [[Rus' (people)|Rus']]) origins. Ukrainian and Belarusian names share many characteristics with family names from other Slavic cultures. Most prominent are the shared root words and suffixes. For example, the root ''koval'' (blacksmith) compares to the Polish ''[[Kowalski|kowal]]'', and the root ''bab'' (woman) is shared with Polish, Slovakian, and Czech. The suffix ''-vych'' (son of) corresponds to the South Slavic ''-vic'', the Russian ''-vich'', and the Polish ''-wicz'', while ''-sky'', ''-ski'', and ''-ska'' are shared with both Polish and Russian, and ''-ak'' with Polish.\n\nHowever some suffixes are more uniquely characteristic to Ukrainian and Belarusian names, especially: ''-chuk'' ([[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]]), ''-enko'' (all other Ukraine) (both son of), ''-ko'' (little [masculine]), ''-ka'' (little [feminine]), ''-shyn'', and ''-uk''. See, for example, [[Mihalko]], Ukrainian Presidents [[Leonid Kravchuk]], and [[Viktor Yushchenko]], Belarusian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]], or former Soviet diplomat [[Andrei Gromyko]]. Such Ukrainian and Belarusian names can also be found in Russia, Poland, or even other Slavic countries (e.g. Croatian general [[Zvonimir \u010cervenko]]), but are due to importation by Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Rusyn ancestors.\n\n==Arabic-speaking countries==\n{{Main article|Arabic name}}\n\nThe given name is always followed by the father's first name, then the father's family surname.\nSome surnames have a prefix of ''ibn''- meaning son of (''ould''- in Mauritania)\nThe surnames follow similar rules defining a relation to a clan, family, place etc.\nSome Arab countries have differences due to historic rule by the Ottoman Empire or due to being a different minority.\n\nA large number of Arabic last names start with \"Al-\" which means \"The\"\n\n'''Arab States of the [[Persian Gulf]]'''.\nNames mainly consist of the person's name followed by the father's first name connected by the word \"ibn\" or \"bin\" (meaning \"son of\"). The last name either refers to the name of the tribe the person belongs to, or to the region, city, or town he/she originates from. In exceptional cases, members of the royal families or ancient tribes mainly, the title (usually H.M./H.E., Prince, or Sheikh) is included in the beginning as a prefix, and the first name can be followed by four names, his father, his grandfather, and great \u2013 grandfather, as a representation of the purity of blood and to show the pride one has for his ancestry.\n\nIn Arabic-speaking [[Levant]]ine countries ([[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]]) it's common to have family names associated with a certain profession or craft, such as \"Al-Haddad\"/\"Haddad\" which means \"Blacksmith\" or \"Al-Najjar\"/\"Najjar\" which means \"Carpenter\".\n\n==South Asia==\n{{further|Indian family names|Pakistani name|Bangladeshi name|List of popular surnames in Nepal}}\n\n===India===\n{{Main article|Indian name}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn India, surnames are placed as last names or before first names, which often denote: village of origin, caste, clan, office of authority their ancestors held, or trades of their ancestors.\n\nThe largest variety of surnames is found in the states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]], which numbers more than the rest of India together. Here surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father's name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived from the place where the family lived, with the 'ker' (Marathi) or 'Kar'(Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaiker, Puneker, Aurangabadker or Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in 'e'. These are usually more archaic than the 'Kar's and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.\n\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]], surnames usually denote family names. It is easy to track family history and the caste they belonged to using a surname.\n\nIn [[Odisha]] and [[West bengal]],  surnames denote the cast they belong. There are also several local surnames like [[Das (surname)|Das]], [[Patnaik]], [[Mohanty]], [[Jena (surname)|Jena]] etc\n\nIt is a common in [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]], and some other parts of [[South India]] that the [[spouse]] adopts her husband's [[first name]] instead of his family or surname name after marriage.<ref>[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Indian-Culture-2871/2010/11/NAME-CHANGE-MARRIAGE.htm]</ref>\n\nIndia is a country with numerous distinct cultural and linguistic groups. Thus, Indian surnames, where formalized, fall into seven general types.\n\nSurnames are based on:\n* Patronymics and ancestry, whereby the father's name or an ancestor's given name is used in its original form or in a derived form (e.g. [[Baranwal]] or Barnwal or Burnwal derived from the ancestor Ahibaran).\n* Occupations (Chamar, [[Patel]] or Patil, meaning Village Headman, [[Gandhi (surname)|Gandhi]], [[Kamath]], [[Kulkarni]], who used to maintain the accounts and records and collect taxes, [[Kapadia (disambiguation)|Kapadia]], Nadkarni, Patwardhan, Patwari, [[Shenoy]], etc.) and priestly distinctions (Bhat, Bhattar, Sastry, Trivedi, Shukla, Chaturvedi, Twivedi, Purohit, Mukhopadhyay); Business people: Shetty, Rai, Hegde is commonly used in kshatriya castes of the Karnataka coastal belt. In addition, many [[Parsi people|Parsi]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Bohra]] and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] families have used English trade names as last names since the 18th and 19th centuries (Contractor, Engineer, Builder).\n* [[Caste]] or clan names ([[Pillai (surname)|Pillai]], Gounder, Goud, Gowda, Boyar, Parmar, Sindhi, Vaish, Reddy, Meena and Naidu) are not surnames but suffixes to first names to indicate their clan or caste.\n* Place names or names derived from places of ancestral origin (Aluru, Marwari, Gavaskar, Gaonkar, Mangeshkar, Kapoor, [[Wamankar]], [[Kokradi]], Karnad, Sandhu,  Medukonduru, Rachapalli).\n* The father's first name is used as a surname in certain Southern states, such as [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Spouses and children take on the first name of the father as their last name or 'surname'.\n* [[Muslim]] surnames generally follow the same rules used in Pakistan. [[Khan (name)|Khan]] is among the most popular surnames, often signifying [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]]/[[Central Asian]] descent.\n* Bestowed titles or other honorifics: titles bestowed by kings, rajas, nawabs and other nobles before the British Raj (Wali, Rai, [[Rao (surname)|Rao]], [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]], [[Gain (surname)|Gain/Gayen]], Panicker, Vallikappen, Moocken, etc.) and those bestowed by the British (Rai, Bahadur).\n\nThe convention is to write the first name followed by middle names and surname. It is common to use the father's first name as the middle name or last name even though it is not universal. In some Indian states like [[Maharashtra]], official documents list the family name first, followed by a comma and the given names.\n\nTraditionally, wives take the surname of their husband after marriage. In modern times, in urban areas at least, this practice is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband's surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.\n\nJains generally use [[Jain]], [[Shah]], [[Firodia]], [[Singhal]] or [[Gupta (name)|Gupta]] as their last names.\nSikhs generally use the words ''Singh'' (\"lion\") and ''Kaur'' (\"princess\") as surnames added to the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names ([[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered ([[Hukamnama]]) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use ''Singh'' in his name and any woman who considered herself a Sikh must use ''Kaur'' in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.\n\nThe modern-day spellings of names originated when families translated their surnames to English, with no standardization across the country. Variations are regional, based on how the name was translated from the local language to English in the 18th, 19th or 20th centuries during British rule. Therefore, it is understood in the local traditions that Baranwal and Barnwal represent the same name derived from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab respectively. Similarly, Tagore derives from Bengal while Thakur is from Hindi-speaking areas. The officially recorded spellings tended to become the standard for that family. In the modern times, some states have attempted standardization, particularly where the surnames were corrupted because of the early British insistence of shortening them for convenience. Thus Bandopadhyay became Banerji, Mukhopadhay became Mukherji, Chattopadhyay became Chatterji, etc. This coupled with various other spelling variations created several surnames based on the original surnames. The [[West Bengal]] Government now insists on re-converting all the variations to their original form when the child is enrolled in school.\n\nSome parts of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Indonesia]] have similar patronymic customs to those of India.\n\n===Nepal===\n{{Further|List of popular surnames in Nepal}}\n\nNepali surnames are divided into three origins; [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] and indigenous origins. Surnames of [[Khas community]] contains toponyms as [[Ghimire]], [[Dahal]], [[Pokharel]], [[Sapkota (disambiguation)|Sapkota]] from respective villages, occupational names as ([[Adhikari]], [[Bhandari]], [[Karki (surname)|Karki]], [[Thapa]]). Many Khas surnames includes suffix as -wal, -al as in [[Katwal]], Silwal, [[Dulal]], [[Khanal]], [[Khulal]], [[Rijal]]. [[Kshatriya]] titles such as [[Bista]], [[Kunwar (disambiguation)|Kunwar]], [[Rana (title)|Rana]], [[Rawat (title)|Rawat]], [[Rawal]], [[Dhami]], [[Shah]], [[Thakuri]], [[Chand (name)|Chand]], were taken as surnames by various [[Kshetri]] and [[Thakuri]]s. [[Khatri]] Kshetris share surnames with mainstream Pahari [[Bahun]]s. Other popular Chhetri surnames include [[Basnyat]], [[Bogati]], [[Budhathoki]], [[Khadka]], [[Khandayat]], [[Mahat (surname)|Mahat]], [[Raut (disambiguation)|Raut]]. Similarly, [[Brahmin]] surnames such as [[Acharya]], [[Bhatta]], [[Joshi]], [[Pandit]], [[Sharma]], [[Upadhyay]] were taken by Pahari [[Bahun]]s. Jaisi [[Bahun]]s bear distinct surnames as Kattel, Banstola, Jaisi, Padhya and share surnames with mainstream [[Bahun]]s. Other Bahun surnames include [[Aryal]], [[Bhattarai]], [[Banskota]], Chaulagain, [[Devkota]], [[Dhakal]], [[Gyawali]], [[Koirala]], [[Mainali]], [[Pandey]], [[Panta (surname)|Panta]], [[Laudari Pandey]], [[Paudel]], [[Regmi (disambiguation)|Regmi]], [[Subedi]], [[Tiwari]], [[Upreti]], [[Lamsal]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mangalamnepal.com/2017/10/bahun-baun-brahmin-is-name-of-class.html|title=Bahun the Nepali Brahmin{{Snd}} Top of the hierarchy of Hindu caste system|last=link|first=Get|last2=Facebook|access-date=2018-12-31|last3=Twitter|last4=Pinterest|last5=Google+|last6=Email|last7=Apps|first7=Other}}</ref> and [[Dhungel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mangalamnepal.com/2017/10/bahun-baun-brahmin-is-name-of-class.html|title=Bahun the Nepali Brahmin{{Snd}} Top of the hierarchy of Hindu caste system|last=link|first=Get|last2=Facebook|access-date=2018-12-31|last3=Twitter|last4=Pinterest|last5=Google+|last6=Email|last7=Apps|first7=Other}}</ref> Many Indian immigrants into [[Pahari, Rajasthan|Pahari]] zone are assimilated under [[Khas people]]s and they carried ancestral clan names as [[Marhatta]], [[Rathore|Rathaur]], [[Chauhan]].

Other common Terai surnames are [[Yadav]], [[Mahato]], [[Kamat]], [[Thakur (Bengali surname)|Thakur]], [[Dev (disambiguation)|Dev]], [[Chaudhary]], [[Kayastha]].\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Main article|Pakistani name|List of Pakistani family names}}\n\nPakistani surnames are basically divided in three categories: [[Pakistani name|Arab naming convention]], tribal or caste names and ancestral names.\n\nFamily names indicating [[Arab]] ancestry, e.g. [[Shaikh]], [[Siddiqui]], [[Abbasi (disambiguation)|Abbasi]], [[Syed]], [[Zaidi (surname)|Zaidi]], [[Khawaja]], [[Naqvi (disambiguation)|Naqvi]], [[Farooqi]], [[Osmani]], [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]], [[Hassani]], and [[Husseini]].\n\nPeople claiming [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ancestry include those with family names [[\u0681\u0627\u0681\u064a dz\u0101dzi]] [[Durrani]], [[Gardezi]], [[Suri (Pashtun)|Suri]], [[Yousafzai]], [[Afridi]], [[Mullagori]], [[Mohmand]], [[Khattak]], [[Wazir (disambiguation)|Wazir]], [[Mehsud]], [[Niazi]].\n\nFamily names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] heritage include [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]], (cheema) [[Baig]] or [[Baig|Beg]], [[Pasha]], [[Barlas]], and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuki]].\n\nPeople claiming Indian ancestry include those with family names [[Barelwi]], [[Lakhnavi]], [[Delhvi]], [[Godharvi]], [[Bilgrami]], and [[Muslim Rajputs|Rajput]].\n\nPeople claiming [[Iran]]ian ancestry include those with family names [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)#Other uses|Agha]], [[Bukhari (nesbat)|Bukhari]], [[Firdausi]], [[Ghazali]], [[Gilan]]i, [[Hamadani (surname)|Hamadani]], [[Isfahani]], [[Kashani]], [[Kirmani|Kermani]], [[Khorasani (disambiguation)|Khorasani]], [[Farooqui]], [[Mir]], [[Mirza]], [[Montazeri]], [[Nishapuri]], [[Noorani]], [[Kayani (name)|Kayani]], [[Qizilbash]], [[Saadi (disambiguation)|Saadi]], [[Sabzvari]], [[Shirazi (disambiguation)|Shirazi]], [[Sistani (disambiguation)|Sistani]], [[Suhrawardi (disambiguation)|Suhrawardi]], [[Yazdani (disambiguation)|Yazdani]], [[Zahedi (disambiguation)|Zahedi]], and [[Zand tribe|Zand]].\n\nTribal names include [[Abro]] [[Afaqi]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]], [[Khogyani (tribe)|Khogyani]] ([[Khogyani (tribe)|Khakwani]]), [[Amini (surname)|Amini]],[Ansari] [[Ashrafkhel]], [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]], [[Bajwa]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Barakzai]], [[Baranzai]], [[Bhatti]], [[Bhutto (clan)|Bhutto]], [[Ranjha clan|Ranjha]], [[Bijarani]], [[Bizenjo]], [[Brahui people|Brohi]], [[Khetran]], [[Bugti]], [[Butt (tribe)|Butt]], [[Farooqui]], [[Gabol]], [[Ghaznavi (surname)|Ghaznavi]], [[Ghilzai]], [[Gichki]], [[Gujjar]], [[Jamali (surname)|Jamali]], [[Jamote]], [[Janjua]], [[Jatoi (tribe)|Jatoi]], [[Jutt]] [[Joyo (tribe)|Joyo]], [[Junejo]], [[Karmazkhel]], Kayani, [[Khar (tribe)|Khar]], [[Khattak]], [[Khuhro]], [[Lakhani (name)|Lakhani]], [[Leghari tribe|Leghari]], [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodhi]], Magsi, [[Malik]], [[Mandokhel]], Mayo, [[Marwat]], [[Mengal]], Mughal, [[Palijo]], Paracha, [[Panhwar]], [[Phul]], [[Popalzai]], [[Qureshi & qusmani]], [[Rabbani (disambiguation)|Rabbani]], [[Raisani]], [[Rakhshani (disambiguation)|Rakhshani]], [[Sahi clan|Sahi]], [[Swati (tribe)|Swati]], [[Soomro]], [[Sulaimankhel]], [[Talpur]], [[Talwar]], [[Thebo]], [[Yousafzai]], and [[Zamani (disambiguation)|Zamani]].\n\nFamily names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]]/ [[Kurd]] ancestry, [[Dogar]].\nIn Pakistan, the official paperwork format regarding personal identity is as follows:\n\nSo and so, son of so and so, of such and such tribe or clan and religion and resident of such and such place. For example, Amir Khan s/o Fakeer Khan, tribe Mughal Kayani or Chauhan Rajput, Follower of religion Islam, resident of Village Anywhere, Tehsil Anywhere, District.\n\nA large number of [[Muslim Rajputs]] have retained their [[surnames]] such as [[Chauhan]], [[Rathore]], [[Parmar]], and [[Janjua]].\n\n==East Asia==\n{{further|Chinese surname|Japanese name|Korean name#Family names|Vietnamese name}}\n\nIn modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, the family name is placed before the given names, although this order may not be observed in translation. Generally speaking, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese names do not alter their order in English ([[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Ho Chi Minh]]) and Japanese names do ([[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]]).<ref>Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzKBXxnkURkC&pg=PA632 pp. 632 ff]. M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}.</ref> However, numerous exceptions exist, particularly for people born in English-speaking countries such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. This is sometimes systematized: in all Olympic events, the athletes of the [[People's Republic of China]] list their names in the Chinese ordering, while Chinese athletes representing other countries, such as the United States, use the Western ordering.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} (In Vietnam, the system is further complicated by the cultural tradition of addressing people by their given name, usually with an honorific. For example, [[Phan V\u0103n Kh\u1ea3i]] is ''properly'' addressed as Mr.&thinsp;Kh\u1ea3i, even though Phan is his family name.)\n\nChinese family names have many types of origins, some claiming dates as early as the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] (2nd millennium BC):\n* from the land or state that one lived in or awarded: [[Chen (surname)|Chen \u9673]] after the [[Chen (state)|state of Chen]], [[Cai (surname)|Cai \u8521]] after the [[state of Cai]];\n* from the given name or [[Posthumous name]] of one's ancestor: [[Zhuang (surname)|Zhuang \u838a]] after [[King Zhuang of Chu]];\n* from the [[Chinese nobility|nobility status]] or [[officer status]] of one's ancestor: [[Wang (surname)|Wang \u738b]] (a king) or [[Shi (surname)|Shi \u53f2]] (a history-recording officer);\n* and some other origins.\n\nIn history, some changed their surnames due to a [[naming taboo]] (from Zhuang \u838a to Yan \u56b4 during the era of [[Emperor Ming of Han|Liu Zhuang \u5289\u838a]]) or as an award by the Emperor ([[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]] was often to senior officers during [[Tang dynasty]]).\n\nIn modern times, some Chinese adopt an [[English name]] in addition to their native given names: e.g., {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|\u674e\u67f1\u9298}} (''Li Zh\u00f9m\u00edng'')}} adopted the English name [[Martin (name)|Martin]] Lee. Particularly in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], the convention is to write both names together: [[Martin Lee Chu-ming]]. Owing to the confusion this can cause, a further convention is sometimes observed of capitalizing the surname: Martin L{{sc|EE}} Chu-ming. Sometimes, however, the Chinese given name is forced into the Western system as a middle name (\"Martin Chu-ming Lee\"); less often, the English given name is forced into the Chinese system (\"Lee Chu-ming Martin\").\n\nIn Japan, the civil law forces a common surname for every married couple, unless in a case of international marriage. In most cases, women surrender their surnames upon marriage, and use the surnames of their husbands. However, a convention that a man uses his wife's family name if the wife is an only child is sometimes observed. A similar tradition called ''ru zhui'' (\u5165\u8d05) is common among Chinese when the bride's family is wealthy and has no son but wants the heir to pass on their assets under the same family name. The Chinese character ''zhui'' (\u8d05) carries a money [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] (\u8c9d), which implies that this tradition was originally based on financial reasons. All their offspring carry the mother's family name. If the groom is the first born with an obligation to carry his own ancestor's name, a compromise may be reached in that the first male child carries the mother's family name while subsequent offspring carry the father's family name. The tradition is still in use in many Chinese communities outside [[mainland China]], but largely disused in China because of social changes from communism. Due to the economic reform in the past decade, accumulation and inheritance of personal wealth made a comeback to the Chinese society. It is unknown if this financially motivated tradition would also come back to mainland China.\n\nIn Chinese, Korean, and Singaporean cultures, women keep their own surnames, while the family as a whole is referred to by the surnames of the husbands.\n\nIn Hong Kong, some women would be known to the public with the surnames of their husbands preceding their own surnames, such as [[Anson Chan|Anson Chan Fang On Sang]]. Anson is an English given name, On Sang is the given name in Chinese, Chan is the surname of Anson's husband, and Fang is her own surname. A name change on legal documents is not necessary. In Hong Kong's English publications, her family names would have been presented in small cap letters to resolve ambiguity, e.g. Anson C<small>HAN</small> F<small>ANG</small> On Sang in full or simply Anson Chan in short form.\n\nIn [[Macau]], some people have their names in Portuguese spelt with some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] style, such as ''Carlos do Rosario Tchiang''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carlos.com.hk/carlos.htm |title=Carlos do Rosario Tchiang (home page)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702024930/http://carlos.com.hk/carlos.htm |archivedate=2007-07-02}}</ref>\n\nChinese women in Canada, especially [[Hongkonger]]s in [[Toronto]], would preserve their [[maiden name]]s before the surnames of their husbands when written in English, for instance, Rosa Chan Leung, where Chan is the maiden name, and Leung is the surname of the husband.\n\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], surnames are predominantly monosyllabic (written with one [[Chinese characters|character]]), though a small number of common [[Chinese compound surname|disyllabic (or written with two characters) surnames]] exists (e.g. the Chinese name ''Ouyang'', the Korean name ''Jegal'' and the Vietnamese name ''Phan-Tran'').\n\nMany Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames are of the same origin, but simply pronounced differently and even transliterated differently overseas in Western nations. For example, the common Chinese surnames Chen, Chan, Chin, Cheng and Tan, the Korean surname Jin, as well as the Vietnamese surname Tr\u1ea7n are often all the same exact character \u9673. The common Korean surname Kim is also the common Chinese surname Jin, and written \u91d1. The common Mandarin surnames Lin or Lim (\u6797) is also one and the same as the common Cantonese or Vietnamese surname ''Lam'' and Korean family name Lim ([[Korean phonology|written/pronounced as Im in South Korea]]). There are people with the surname of Hayashi (\u6797) in Japan too. The common Chinese surname \u674e, translated to English as Lee, is, in Chinese, the same character but transliterated as Li according to [[pinyin]] convention. Lee is also a common surname of Koreans, and the character is identical.\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{Main article|Vietnamese name}}\n40% of all [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] have the surname [[Nguyen]]. This may be because when a new dynasty took power in Vietnam it was custom to adopt that dynasty's surname. The last dynasty in Vietnam was the [[Nguyen dynasty]], so as a result, many people have this surname.\n\n== Africa ==\n\n===East Africa===\nIn several [[Northeast Bantu languages]] such as [[Kamba language|Kamba]], [[Taita language|Taita]] and [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]] in [[Kenya]] the word \"wa\" (meaning \"of\") is inserted before the surname, for instance, Mugo wa Kibiru ([[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]) and Mekatilili wa Menza ([[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]]).\n\n===Burundi and Rwanda===\nIn [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], most, if not all surnames have God in it, for example, Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (I thank God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth). But not all surnames end with the suffix -imana. Irakoze is one of these (technically meaning Thank God, though it is hard to translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.\n\n=== Ethiopia and Eritrea ===\n{{Main article|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}\n\nThe patronymic custom in most of the [[Horn of Africa]] gives children the father's first name as their surname. The family then gives the child its first name. Middle names are unknown. So, for example, a person's name might be ''Bereket Mekonen ''. In this case, ''Bereket '' is the first name and ''Mekonen'' is the surname, and also the first name of the father.\n\nThe paternal grandfather's name is often used if there is a requirement to identify a person further, for example, in school registration. Also, different cultures and tribes use the father's or grandfather's given name as the family's name. For example, some Oromos use Warra Ali to mean families of Ali, where Ali, is either the householder, a father or grandfather.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the customs surrounding the bestowal and use of family names is as varied and complex as the cultures to be found there. There are so many cultures, nations or tribes, that currently there can be no one formula whereby to demonstrate a clear pattern of Ethiopian family names. In general, however, Ethiopians use their father's name as a surname in most instances where identification is necessary, sometimes employing both father's and grandfather's names together where exigency dictates.\n\nMany people in Eritrea have Italian surnames, but all of these are owned by [[Italian Eritreans|Eritreans of Italian descent]].\n\n==Other countries==\n\n===Albania===\nA full Albanian name consists of a given name ({{lang-sq|em\u00ebr}}), patronymic ({{lang-sq|at\u00ebsi}}) and family name ({{lang-sq|mbiem\u00ebr}}), for example ''Agron Mark Gjoni''. The patronymic is simply the given name of the individual's father, with no suffix added. The family name is typically a noun in the definite form or at the very least ends with a vowel or -j (an approximant close to -i). Many traditional last names end with -aj (previously -anj), which is more prevalent in certain regions of Albania and Kosovo. For clarification, the \u201cfamily name\u201d is typically the father\u2019s fathers name (grandfather).{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nProper names in Albanian are fully declinable like any noun (e.g. ''Marinelda'', genitive case ''i/e Marineld\u00ebs'' \"of Marinelda\").\n\n===Armenia===\n[[Armenian surnames]] almost always have the ending ({{lang-hy|\u0575\u0561\u0576}}) transliterated into English as -yan or -ian (spelled -ean (\u0565\u0561\u0576) in Western Armenian and pre-Soviet Eastern Armenian, of Ancient [[Armenia]]n or [[Iran]]ian origin, presumably meaning \"son of\"), though names with that ending can also be found among Persians and a few other nationalities. Armenian surnames can derive from a geographic location, profession, noble rank, personal characteristic or personal name of an ancestor. Armenians in the diaspora sometimes adapt their surnames to help assimilation. In Russia, many have changed -yan to -ov (or -ova for women). In Turkey, many have changed the ending to -o\u011flu (also meaning \"son of\"). In English and French-speaking countries, many have shortened their name by removing the ending (for example [[Charles Aznavour]]). In ancient Armenia, many noble names ended with the locative -t'si (example, [[Moses of Chorene|Khorenatsi]]) or -uni ([[Bagratuni (disambiguation)|Bagratuni]]). Several modern Armenian names also have a Turkish suffix which appears before -ian/-yan: -lian denotes a placename; -djian denotes a profession. Some Western Armenian names have a particle Der, while their Eastern counterparts have Ter. This particle indicates an ancestor who was a priest (Armenian priests can choose to marry or remain celibate, but married priests cannot become a bishop). Thus someone named Der Bedrosian (Western) or Ter Petrosian (Eastern) is a descendant of an Armenian priest. The convention is still in use today: the children of a priest named Hagop Sarkisian would be called Der Sarkisian. Other examples of Armenian surnames: Adonts, Sakunts, Vardanyants, Rshtuni.\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nTraditional Azeri surnames usually end with \"-l\u0131\", \"-lu\", (Turkic for 'with' or 'belonging to'), \"-o\u011flu\", \"-q\u0131z\u0131\" (Turkic for 'son of' and 'daughter of'), \"-zade\" (Persian for 'born of'). Azerbaijanis of Iranian descent traditionally use suffixes such as '-pour' or '-zadeh', meaning 'born of' with their father's name. It is, however, more usual for them to use the name of the city in which their ancestors lived (e.g. Tabrizpour for those from Tabriz) or their occupation (e.g. Damirchizadeh for blacksmiths). Also, due to it being a part of the Russian Empire, many last names carry Slavic endings of \"-ov\" for men and \"-ova\" for women. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Georgia===\n{{Main article|List of Georgian surnames}}\n\nMost eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] surnames end with the suffix of \"-shvili\", (e.g. Kartveli'shvili) Georgian for \"child\" or \"offspring\". Western Georgian surnames most commonly have the suffix \"-dze\", (e.g. [[:ka:\u10da\u10d0\u10d1\u10d0\u10eb\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8|Laba'dze]]) Georgian for \"son\". [[Megrelian]] surnames usually end in \"-ia\", \"-ua\" or \"-ava\". Other location-specific endings exist: In [[Svaneti]] \"-iani\", meaning \"belonging to\", or \"hailing from\", is common. In the eastern Georgian highlands common endings are \"uri\" and \"uli\". Some noble family names end in \"eli\", meaning \"of (someplace)\".\nIn [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the surname is not normally used as the polite form of address; instead, the given name is used together with a title. For instance, Nikoloz Kartvelishvili is politely addressed as ''bat'ono Nikoloz'' \"My Lord. Nikoloz\".\n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n{{Main article|Greeks#Surnames}}\n\nGreek surnames are most commonly patronymics. Occupation, characteristic, or ethnic background and location/origin-based surnames names also occur; they are sometimes supplemented by nicknames.\n\nCommonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine [[proper nouns]] in the [[nominative case]]. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the [[genitive case]] of this proper noun for patronymic reasons.\n\nAlthough surnames are static today, dynamic and changing patronym usage survives in middle names in Greece where the genitive of the father's first name is commonly the middle name.\n\nBecause of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have [[Katharevousa]] forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris, and former vernacular practice (prefixing the surname to the proper name) was to call John Eleutherios '''Leftero-giannis'''.\n\nModern practice is to call the same person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive. However, children are almost always baptised with the archaic form of the name so in official matters, the child will be referred to as Ioannis Eleftheriou and not Giannis Eleftheriou.\n\nFemale surnames are most often in the Katharevousa genitive case of a male name. This is an innovation of the Modern Greek state; Byzantine practice was to form a feminine counterpart of the male surname (e.g. masculine Palaiologos, Byzantine feminine Palaiologina, Modern feminine Palaiologou).\n\nIn the past, women would change their surname when married to that of their husband (again in the genitive case) signifying the transfer of \"dependence\" from the father to the husband. In earlier Modern Greek society, women were named with '''''-aina''''' as a feminine suffix on the husband's first name: \"Giorgaina\", \"Mrs George\", \"Wife of George\". Nowadays, a woman's legal surname does not change upon marriage, though she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though in rare cases, if the bride and groom have agreed before the marriage, the children can receive the maternal surname.\n\nSome surnames are prefixed with '''''Papa-''''', indicating ancestry from a priest, e.g. ''Papageorgiou'', the \"son of a priest named George\". Others, like '''''Archi-''''' and '''''Mastro-''''' signify \"boss\" and \"[[tradesman]]\" respectively.\n\nPrefixes such as '''''Konto-''''', '''''Makro-''''', and '''''Chondro-''''' describe body characteristics, such as \"short\", \"tall/long\" and \"fat\". ''Gero-'' and ''Palaio-'' signify \"old\" or \"wise\".\n\nOther prefixes include '''''[[hajji|Hadji]]-''''' (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ae- or \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9-) which was an honorific deriving from the Arabic [[Hadj]] or pilgrimage, and indicate that the person had made a pilgrimage (in the case of Christians, to Jerusalem) and '''''Kara-''''' which is attributed to the Turkish word for \"black\" deriving from the [[Ottoman Empire]] era. The Turkish suffix '''''-oglou''''' (derived from a patronym, ''-o\u011flu'' in Turkish) can also be found. Although they are of course more common among Greece's Muslim minority, they still can be found among the Christian majority, often Greeks or [[Karamanlides]] who were pressured to leave Turkey after the Turkish Republic was founded (since Turkish surnames only date to the founding of the Republic, when Atat\u00fcrk made them compulsory).\n\n[[Arvanitic]] surnames also exist; an example is ''Tzanavaras'' or ''Tzavaras'', from the Arvanitic word ''\u00e7anavar'' or ''\u00e7avar'' meaning \"brave\" (''pallikari'' in Greek).<ref>Tzavaras, Ath.: \"Agapite Aderfe Vasileie\", Ekdosis Exantas, Athens 1999</ref>\n\nMost Greek patronymic suffixes are diminutives, which vary by region. The most common Hellenic patronymic suffixes are:\n* '''''-poulos/-poulou''''', which has a Latin origin (''pullus'') and means \"the little\", representing \"the son of ...\", so if a man's family name is \"Christopoulos\", it means that his father was named \"Christos\". This suffix is very widespread throughout Greece and is originally from the [[Peloponessus]] in particular.\n* '''''-idis/iadis/antis''''' The suffix '''''-idis''''' (often transliterated ''-ides'' in English and French) is the oldest in use. [[Zeus]], for example, was also referred to as ''[[Cronides]]'' (\"son of [[Cronus]]\"). A common suffix in Byzantium around [[Bithynia]] and [[Byzantine Thrace]] (Constantinople), also used by [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] in the [[Pontic Alps]], northeast [[Anatolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the former [[Russian Caucasus]] region of [[Kars Oblast]] e.g. ''Mikhailidis'', the \"clan of Michael\"\n* '''''-akis/-aki''''' is associated primarily with [[Crete]] and the [[Aegean Islands]]. It is a patronymic signifying \"little\" and/or \"son\"; therefore ''Theodorakis'' is \"little Theodore\".\n\nOthers, less common, are:\n* '''''-atos/-atou''''' (from [[Cephallonia]] and other [[Ionian Islands]])\n* '''''-as/-a/-ekas/kas''''' (from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]) and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]\n* '''''-ellis/-elli''''' (from [[Lesbos Island|Lesvos Island]])\n* '''''-eas/akos/oggonas''''' (from [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]])\n* '''''-oglou''''' (from the Turkish suffix for \"child of\" used by both genders)\n* '''''-ou''''' (genitive, from [[Cyprus]])\n* '''''-ou/ides/kos''''' (from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]])\n* '''''-ekas/las''''' (from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]])\n\nEither the surname or the given name may come first in different contexts; in newspapers and in informal uses, the order is ''given name + surname'', while in official documents and forums (tax forms, registrations, military service, school forms), the surname is often listed or said first.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{further|Hungarian name|Hungarian language#Name order}}\n\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], like Asian languages but unlike most other European ones (see French and German above for exceptions), the family name is placed before the given names. This usage does not apply to non-Hungarian names, for example \"Tony Blair\" will remain \"Tony Blair\" when written in Hungarian texts.\n\nNames of Hungarian individuals, however, appear in Western order in English writing.\n\n===Indonesia===\nIndonesians comprise more than 300 ethnic groups. Not all of these groups traditionally have surnames, and in the populous [[Java]] surnames are not common at all \u2013 regardless of which one of the [[Religion in Indonesia|six officially recognized religions]] the name carrier profess. For instance, a Christian Javanese woman named ''Agnes Mega Rosalin'' has three forenames and no surname. \"Agnes\" is her Christian name, but \"Mega\" can be the first name she uses and the name which she is addressed with. \"Rosalin\" is only a middle name. Nonetheless, Indonesians are well aware of the custom of family names, which is known as ''marga'' or ''fam'', and such names have become a specific kind of identifier. People can tell what a person's heritage is by his or her family or clan name.\n* The various ethnicities of [[Batak people]] from North Sumatra are known for their strict tradition of preserving their family names, which are actually clan names. See [[Marga (Batak)]] for details.\n* The [[matrilineal]] clan names of the [[Minangkabau people]] are passed down from mothers to their children. Minangkabau is the largest matrilineal society in the world.\n* The [[Minahasan]] people of North Sulawesi have an extensive list of surnames, such as ''Toar, Lumimuut, Emor, Muntuan, Nayoan, Wenas'' and ''Luntungan''.\n* The [[Ambonese]] people of the Maluku Islands have family names such as ''Lawalata, Matulessy'' and ''Latumahina''.\n* The various ethnicities of [[Dayak people]] from the provinces in [[Kalimantan]] have surnames such as ''Dau'' and ''Narang''.\n* The [[Bugis]] people from South Sulawesi have surnames such as ''Mappanyukki, Mallarangeng'' and ''Matalatta''.\n* Among the [[Toraja]] people of South Sulawesi, common surname elements include ''Rante\u2013, Pong\u2013, Allo\u2013, \u2013bua, \u2013linggi''. Examples: ''Rantedatu, Ranteallo, Pongrambu, Pongtiku, Pongrangga, Allodatu, Randebua, Tanabua, Tarukbua, Datubua, Allobua, Senolinggi''.\n\n[[Java (island)|Javanese]] people are the majority in Indonesia, and most do not have any surname. There are some individuals, especially the old generation, who have only one name, such as \"[[Suharto]]\" and \"[[Sukarno]]\". These are not only common with the Javanese but also with other Indonesian ethnic groups who do not have the tradition of surnames. If, however, they are Muslims, they might opt to follow [[Arabic name|Arabic naming]] customs, but Indonesian Muslims don't automatically follow Arabic name traditions.\n\nIn conjunction with migration to Europe or America, Indonesians without surnames often adopt a surname based on some family name or middle name. The forms for [[Visa (document)|visa]] application many Western countries use, has a square for writing the last name which cannot be left unfilled by the applicant.\n\nMost [[Chinese Indonesian]]s substituted their Chinese surnames with Indonesian-sounding surnames due to political pressure from 1965 to 1998 under Suharto's regime.\n\n===Iranian/Persian/Kazan===<!-- Other pages link here, so please don't change the heading unless you also check and update them -->\nPersian last names may be:\n* Simple nouns; e.g. Afshar (\"Of [[Afsharid dynasty]]\"), [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Bahar]], [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m|Khayyam]]\n* Noun plus a suffix; e.g. Golzaar (Gol + -zaar), Amouzgaar (Amouz + -gaar), [[Khosrau I|Daadgar]] (Daad + -gar)\n* More complex compound nouns; e.g. Bolurforushan (Bolur + forush + -an), [[Ahmedinejad]] (Ahmed + -i + -nejad), [[Farshchian]] (Farsh + -chi + -an)\n* Two or more nouns; e.g. [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Hashemi Rafsanjani]]\n\nSuffixes include: -an (plural suffix), -i (\"of\"), -zad/-zadeh (\"born of\"), -pur (\"son of\"), -nejad (\"from the race of\"), -nia (\"descendant of\"), -mand (\"having or pertaining to\"), -vand (\"succeeding\"), -far (\"holder of\"), -doost (\"[[:wiktionary:-phile#English|-phile]]\"), -khah (\"seeking of\"), -manesh (\"having the manner of\"), -ian/-yan, -gar and -chi (\"whose vocation pertains\").\n\nAn example is names of geographical locations plus \"-i\": Irani (\"Iranian\"), Gilani (\"of [[Gilan]] province\"), Tabrizi (\"of the city of [[Tabriz]]\").\n\nAnother example is last names that indicate relation to religious groups such as [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrian]] (e.g. Goshtaspi, Namiranian, Azargoshasp), [[Persian Jews|Jewish]] (e.g. Yaghubian [Jacobean], Hayyem [Life], Shaul [Saul]) or [[Muslim]] (e.g. Alavi, Islamnia, [[Montazeri]])\n\nLast names are arbitrary; their holder need not to have any relation with their meaning.\n\nTraditionally in Iran, the wife does not take her husband's surname, although children take the surname of their father. Individual reactions notwithstanding, it is possible to call a married woman by her husband's surname. This is facilitated by the fact that English words \"Mrs.\", \"Miss\", \"Woman\", \"Lady\" and \"Wife (of)\" in a polite context are all translated into \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645\" (Khaanom). Context, however, is important: \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u06af\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\" (Khaanom Goldust) may, for instance, refer to the daughter of Mr. Goldust instead of his wife.\nWhen most of Iranian surnames are used with a name, the name will be ended with a suffix _E or _ie (of) such as Hasan_e roshan (Hasan is name and roshan is surname) that means Hasan of Roshan or Mosa_ie saiidi (Muses of saiidi). The _e is not for surname and it is difficult to say it is a part of surname.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main article|Italian surname}}\n\nItaly has around 350,000 surnames. Most of them derive from the following sources: [[patronym]] or [[wikt:ilk|ilk]] (e.g. ''Francesco di Marco'', \"Francis, son of Mark\" or ''[[Eduardo de Filippo]]'', \"Edward belonging to the family of Philip\"), occupation (e.g. ''[[Enzo Ferrari]]'', \"Heinz (of the) Blacksmiths\"), personal characteristic (e.g. nicknames or pet names like ''Dario Forte'', \"Darius the Strong\"), geographic origin (e.g. ''Elisabetta Romano'', \"Elisabeth from Rome\") and objects (e.g. ''Carlo Sacchi'', \"Charles Bags\"). The two most common Italian family names, ''Russo'' and ''Rossi'', mean the same thing, \"Red\", possibly referring to the hair color.\n\nBoth Western and Eastern orders are used for full names: the given name usually comes first, but the family name may come first in administrative settings; lists are usually indexed according to the last name.\n\nSince 1975, women have kept their own surname when married, but until recently (2000){{dubious|reason=No given reference to such a reform. The relevant rule, article 143 bis of Italian Civil Code, stays unchanged since 1975.|date=November 2013}} they could have added the surname of the husband according to the civil code, although it was a very seldom-used practice. In recent years, the husband's surname cannot be used in any official situation.{{dubious|reason=No given reference to such a reform. The relevant rule, article 143 bis of Italian Civil Code, stays unchanged since 1975.|date=November 2013}}<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.jus.unitn.it/cardozo/Obiter_Dictum/codciv/Lib1.htm Italian Civil Code, art. 143 bis]</ref> In some unofficial situations, sometimes both surnames are written (the proper first), sometimes separated by ''in'' (e.g. ''Giuseppina Mauri in Crivelli'') or, in case of widows, ''ved.'' (''vedova'').\n\n===Latvia===\n{{Main article|Latvian name}}\n\nLatvian male surnames usually end in ''-s'', ''-\u0161'' or ''-is'' whereas the female versions of the same names end in ''-a'' or ''-e'' or ''s'' in both unmarried and married women.\n\nBefore the emancipation from serfdom (1817 in [[Courland]], 1819 in [[Vidzeme]], 1861 in [[Latgale]]) only noblemen, free craftsmen or people living in towns had surnames. Therefore, the oldest Latvian surnames originate from German or Low German, reflecting the dominance of German as an official language in Latvia till the 19th century. Examples: ''Meijers/Meijere'' (German: ''Meier'', farm administrator; akin to Mayor), ''Millers/Millere'' (German: ''M\u00fcller'', miller), ''\u0160mits/\u0160mite'' (German: ''Schmidt'', smith), ''\u0160ulcs/\u0160ulca'' (German: ''Schulze'', constable), ''Ulmanis'' (German: ''Ullmann'', a person from [[Ulm]]), ''Godmanis'' (a God-man), ''P\u0113tersons'' (son of Peter). Some Latvian surnames, mainly from Latgale are of Polish or Belorussian origin by changing the final ''-ski/-cki'' to ''-skis/-ckis'', ''-czyk'' to ''-\u010diks'' or ''-vich/-wicz'' to ''-vi\u010ds'', such as ''Sokolovkis/Sokolovska'', ''Baldun\u010diks/Baldun\u010dika'' or ''Ratkevi\u010ds/Ratkevi\u010da''.\n\nMost Latvian peasants received their surnames in 1826 (in [[Vidzeme]]), in 1835 (in [[Courland]]), and in 1866 (in [[Latgale]]). Diminutives were the most common form of family names. Examples: ''Kalni\u0146\u0161/Kalni\u0146a'' (small hill), ''B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161/B\u0113rzi\u0146a'' (small birch).\n\nNowadays many Latvians of Slavic descent have surnames of Russian, Belarusian, or Ukrainian origin, for example ''Volkovs/Volkova'' or ''Anto\u0146enko''.\n\n===Libya===\nLibya's names and surnames have a strong Islamic/Arab nature, with some Turkish influence from Ottoman Empire rule of nearly 400 years.\nAmazigh, Touareg and other minorities also have their own name/surname traditions.\nDue to its location as a trade route and the different cultures that had their impact on Libya throughout history, one can find names that could have originated in neighboring countries, including clan names from the Arabian Peninsula, and Turkish names derived from military rank or status (''Basha'', ''Agha'').\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{Main article|Lithuanian name}}\n\nLithuanian names follow the Baltic distinction between male and female suffixes of names, although the details are different. Male surnames usually end in ''-a'', ''-as'', ''-aitis'', ''-ys'', ''-ius'', or ''-us'', whereas the female versions change these suffixes to ''-ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117'', and ''-ut\u0117'' respectively (if unmarried), ''-ien\u0117'' (if married), or ''-\u0117'' (not indicating the marital status). Some Lithuanians have names of Polish or another Slavic origin, which are made to conform to Lithuanian by changing the final ''-ski'' to ''-skas'', such as ''Sadauskas'', with the female version bein -''skait\u0117'' (if unmarried), ''-skien\u0117'' (if married), or ''-sk\u0117'' (not indicating the marital status).\n\n===Malta===\nDifferent cultures have their impact on the demographics of the Maltese islands, and this is evident in the various surnames Maltese citizens bear nowadays.<ref>http://en.geneanum.com/malta/documents/genealogy/maltese-surnames.html</ref> There are very few ''Maltese'' surnames per se: the few that originate from Maltese places of origin include ''Chircop'' ([[Kirkop]]), ''Lia'' ([[Lija]]), ''Balzan'' ([[Balzan]]), ''Valletta'' ([[Valletta]]), and ''Sciberras'' (Xebb ir-Ras Hill, on which Valletta was built). The village of [[Munxar]], [[Gozo]] is characterised by the majority of its population having one of two surnames, either ''Curmi'' or ''de Brincat''. In Gozo, the surnames ''Bajada'' and ''Farrugia'' are also common.\n* '''[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and Italian surnames'''\nSicilian and Italian surnames are common due to the close vicinity to Malta. Sicilian Italians were the first to colonise the Maltese islands. Common examples include ''Azzopardi'', ''Bonello'', ''Cauchi'', ''[[Farrugia]]'', ''[[Gauci]]'', ''Rizzo'', ''[[Schembri]]'', ''Tabone'', ''Vassallo'', ''Vella''.\n* '''French surnames'''\nCommon examples include ''Depuis'', ''Montfort'', ''Monsenuier'', ''Tafel''.\n* '''English surnames'''\nEnglish surnames exist for a number of reasons, but mainly due to migration as well as Malta forming a part of the British Empire in the 19th century and most of the 20th. Common examples include ''Bone'', ''Harding'', ''Atkins'', ''Mattocks'', ''Smith'', ''Jones'', ''Woods'', ''Turner''.\n* '''[[Siculo-Arabic|Sicilian Arabic]] surnames'''\nArabic surnames occur in part due to the early presence of the Arabs in Malta. Common examples include ''Sammut'', ''Camilleri'', ''Zammit'', and ''Xuereb''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cassar |first=Mario |url=https://ema-ps.academia.edu/MarioCassar/Papers/99102/Vestiges_of_Arabic_Nomencalture_in_Maltese_Surnames |title=Vestiges of Arabic Nomenclature in Maltese Surnames &#124; Mario Cassar{{Snd}} Academia.edu |publisher=Ema-ps.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n* '''Spanish surnames'''\nCommon surnames of Spanish origin include ''Abela'', ''Galdes'', ''Herrera'', and ''Guzman''.\n* '''German surnames'''\nSurnames from foreign countries from the Middle Ages include German,<br />\nsuch as ''von Brockdorff'', ''Hyzler'', and ''Schranz''.\n* '''Greek surnames'''\nMany of the earliest Maltese surnames are Sicilian Greek, e.g. ''Cilia'', ''Calleia'', ''Brincat'', ''Cauchi''. Much less common are recent surnames from Greece; examples include ''Dacoutros'', and ''Trakosopoulos''\n* '''Jewish surnames'''\nThe original Jewish community of Malta and Gozo has left no trace of their presence on the islands since they were expelled in January 1493.\n* '''Customs'''\nIn line with the practice in other Christian, European states, women generally assume their husband's surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear. Some women opt to retain their old name, for professional/personal reasons, or combine their surname with that of their husband.\n\n===Mongolia===\n{{Main article|Mongolian name}}\n\nMongolians do not use surnames in the way that most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics \u2013 then called ''ovog'', now called ''etsgiin ner'' \u2013 are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in [[genitive]] case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial \u2013 Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj ''guai'' \u2013 Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are usually just kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.\n\nSince 2000, Mongolians have been officially using [[List of medieval Mongolian tribes and clans|clan names]] \u2013 ''ovog'', the same word that had been used for the patronymics before \u2013 on their IDs. Many people chose the names of the ancient clans and tribes such [[Borjigin]], Besud, [[Jalair]], etc. Also many extended families chose the names of the native places of their ancestors. Some chose the names of their most ancient known ancestor. Some just decided to pass their own given names (or modifications of their given names) to their descendants as clan names. Some chose other attributes of their lives as surnames. [[J\u00fcgderdemidiin G\u00fcrragchaa|G\u00fcrragchaa]] chose Sansar (Cosmos). Clan names precede the patronymics and given names, e.g. Besud Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.<ref>[http://www.mongoleiservice.de/mongolei__gesellschaft/mongolei__gesellschaft.html Hans Peter Vietze: Mongolische Namen (in German)]</ref> These clan names have a significance and are included in Mongolian passports.\n\n===Myanmar (Burma)===\n{{Main article|Burmese name}}\n\nPeople from Myanmar or Burmese, have no family names. This, to some, is the only known Asian people having no family names at all. Some of those from Myanmar or Burma, who are familiar with European or American cultures, began to put to their younger generations with a family name \u2013 adopted from the notable ancestors. For example, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the late Father of Independence General Aung San; [[Hayma Ne Win]], is the daughter of the famous actor [[Kawleikgyin Ne Win]] etc.\n\n===The Philippines===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main article|Filipino name}}\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, there was no standardization of surnames in the [[Philippines]]. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, as well as those who took certain surnames simply because they had a certain prestige, usually ones related to the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] religion, such as [[de los Santos]] (\"of the saints\") and [[Delacruz|de la Cruz]] (\"of the cross\").\n\nOn 21 November 1849, the Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa]], decreed an end to these arbitrary practices, the systematic distribution of surnames to Filipinos without prior surnames and the universal implementation of the Spanish naming system. This produced the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' (\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\"), which listed permitted surnames with origins in Spanish, Filipino, and Hispanicised Chinese words, names, and numbers. Thus, many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the rest of the Hispanophone world. Surnames with connections to nobility, either Spanish or local, however, was explicitly prohibited, and only allowed to be retained by families with noble status or having the surname used in three consecutive generations. The book contained many words coming from Spanish and the Philippine languages such as Tagalog, as well as many [[Basque surnames]] such as Zuloaga or Aguirre.\n\nThe colonial authorities implemented this decree because too many (early) Christianized Filipinos assumed religious names. There soon were too many people surnamed \"de los Santos\" (\"of the saints\"), \"de la Cruz\" (\"of the cross\"), \"[[del Rosario]]\" (\"of the Rosary\"), \"[[Bautista]]\" (\"Baptist\"), et cetera, which made it difficult for the Spanish colonists to control the Filipino people, and most importantly, to collect taxes. These extremely common names were also banned by the decree unless the name has been used by a family for at least four generations. This Spanish naming custom also countered the native custom before the Spanish period, wherein siblings assumed different surnames. Claver\u00eda's decree was enforced to different degrees in different parts of the colony.\n\nBecause of this implementation of [[Spanish naming customs]], of the arrangement \"given_name + paternal_surname + maternal_surname\", in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.\n\nIn practice, the application of this decree varied from municipality to municipality. Most municipalities received surnames starting with only one initial letter, but some are assigned surnames starting with two or three initial letters. For example, the majority of residents of the island of [[Banton, Romblon|Banton]] in the province of Romblon have surnames starting with F such as ''Fabicon'', ''Fallarme'', ''Fadrilan'', and ''Ferran''. Other examples are case of Batangas, Batangas (present-day [[Batangas City]]), where most residents bear surnames starting with the letters A, B, and C, such as ''Abacan'', ''Albayalde'', ''Almarez'', ''Andal'', ''Arce'', ''Arceo'', ''Arguelles'', ''Arrieta'', ''Babasa'', ''Balmes'', ''Basco'', ''Baylosis'', ''Berberabe'', ''Biscocho'', ''Blanco'', ''Borbon'', ''Calingasan'', ''Caringal'', ''Chavez'', ''Cuenca'', and ''Custodio'' (in addition to some bearing native Tagalog surnames, such as ''Dimaano'', ''Dimacuha'', ''Macatangay'', ''Malabanan'', and ''Marasigan''), and [[Argao, Cebu|Argao]], [[Cebu]], where most residents bear surnames starting with ''VI'' and ''Al'', such as ''Villaluz'', ''Villaflor'', ''Villamor'', ''Villanueva'', ''Albo'', ''Alcain'', ''Alcarez'', ''Algones'', etc.\n\nThus, although perhaps a majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry. In addition, most Filipinos currently do not use Spanish accented letters in their Spanish derived names. The lack of accents in Filipino Spanish has been attributed to the lack of accents on the predominantly American typewriters after the US gained control of the Philippines.\n\nThe vast majority of Filipinos follow a naming system in the American order (i.e. given_name + middle_name + surname), which is the reverse of the Spanish naming order (i.e. given_name + paternal_surname + maternal_surname). Children take the mother's surname as their [[middle name]], followed by their father's as their surname; for example, a son of Juan de la Cruz and his wife Mar\u00eda Agbayani may be David Agbayani de la Cruz. Women usually take the surnames of their husband upon marriage, and consequently lose their maiden middle names; so upon her marriage to David de la Cruz, the full name of Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg would become Laura Macaraeg de la Cruz. Their maiden last names automatically become their middle names upon marriage.\n\nThere are other sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, which in some cases could indicate Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanicised Chinese numerals and other Hispanicised Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the ''Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos''. For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanicised Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor's surname as well as the name of that ancestor's godparent on receiving Christian baptism.\n\nIn the predominantly [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] areas of the southern Philippines, adoption of surnames was influenced by Islamic religious terms. As a result, surnames among Filipino Muslims are largely Arabic-based, and include such surnames as [[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]] and Haradji.\n\nThere are also Filipinos who, to this day, have no surnames at all, particularly if they come from indigenous cultural communities.\n\n====Naming customs in the Philippines====\nPrior to the establishment of the Philippines as a US territory during the earlier part of the 20th century, Filipinos usually followed Iberian naming customs. However, upon the promulgation of the Family Code of 1987, Filipinos formalized adopting the American system of using their surnames.\n\nA common Filipino name will consist of the given name (mostly 2 given names are given), the initial letter of the mother's maiden name and finally the father's surname (i.e. Lucy Anne C. de Guzman). Also, women are allowed to retain their maiden name or use both her and her husband's surname as a [[double-barreled surname]], separated by a dash. This is common in feminist circles or when the woman holds a prominent office (e.g. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]]). In more traditional circles, especially those who belong to the prominent families in the provinces, the custom of the woman being addressed as \"Mrs. Husband's Full Name\" is still common.\n\nFor widows, who chose to marry again, two norms are in existence. For those who were widowed before the Family Code, the full name of the woman remains while the surname of the deceased husband is attached. That is, Maria Andres, who was widowed by Ignacio Dimaculangan will have the name Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan. If she chooses to marry again, this name will still continue to exist while the surname of the new husband is attached. Thus, if Maria marries Rene de los Santos, her new name will be Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos.\n\nHowever, a new norm is also in existence. The woman may choose to use her husband's surname to be one of her middle names. Thus, Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos may also be called Maria A.D. de los Santos.\n\nChildren will however automatically inherit their father's surname if they are considered legitimate. If the child is born out of wedlock, the mother will automatically pass her surname to the child, unless the father gives a written acknowledgment of paternity. The father may also choose to give the child both his parents' surnames if he wishes (that is Gustavo Paredes, whose parents are Eulogio Paredes and Juliana Angeles, while having Maria Solis as a wife, may name his child Kevin S. Angeles-Paredes.\n\nIn some Tagalog regions, the norm of giving patronyms, or in some cases matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of course not official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited. It is not uncommon to refer to someone as Juan anak ni Pablo (John, the son of Paul) or Juan apo ni Teofilo (John, the grandson of Theophilus).\n\n===Romania===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n{{main article|Romanian names}}\nIn [[Romania]], like in most of Europe, it is customary for a child to take his father's family name, and a wife to take her husband's last name. However, this is not compulsory{{Snd}} spouses and parents are allowed to choose other options too, as the law is flexible (see Art. 282,<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-282-alegerea-numelui-de-familie-formalitatile-pentru-incheierea-casatoriei-incheierea-casatoriei</ref> Art. 449<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-449-numele-copilului-din-casatorie-situatia-legala-a-copilului-filiatia</ref> Art. 450.<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-450-numele-copilului-din-afara-casatoriei-situatia-legala-a-copilului-filiatia</ref> of the [[Civil Code of Romania]]).\n\nUntil the 19th century, the names were primarily of the form \"[given name] [father's name] [grandfather's name]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/seesscm/romanian-personal-names|title=Romanian Personal Names|last=|first=|date=15 October 2015|website=Slavic Cataloging Manual|access-date=}}</ref> The few exceptions are usually famous people or the nobility (boyars). The name reform introduced around 1850 had the names changed to a western style, most likely imported from France, consisting of a given name followed by a family name.\n\nAs such, the name is called ''prenume'' (French ''pr\u00e9nom''), while the family name is called ''nume'' or, when otherwise ambiguous, ''nume de familie'' (\"family name\"). Although not mandatory, middle names are common.\n\nHistorically, when the family name reform was introduced in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a [[matronym]] when the father was dead or unknown. A common convention was to append the suffix ''-escu'' to the father's name, e.g. ''Anghelescu'' (\"''Anghel's'' child\") and ''Petrescu'' (\"''Petre's'' child\"). (The ''-escu'' seems to come from Latin ''-iscum'', thus being cognate with Italian ''-esco'' and French ''-esque''.) Another common convention was to append the suffix ''-eanu'' to the name of the place of origin, e.g. ''Munteanu'' (\"from the mountains\") and ''Moldoveanu'' (\"from ''Moldova''\"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.\n\nThere are also descriptive family names derived from occupations, nicknames, and events, e.g. ''Botezatu'' (\"baptised\"), ''Barbu'' (\"bushy bearded\"), ''Prodan'' (\"foster\"), ''B\u0103lan'' (\"blond\"), ''Fieraru'' (\"smith\"), ''Croitoru'' (\"tailor\"), \"[[P\u0103curaru]]\" (\"shepherd\").\n\nRomanian family names remain the same regardless of the sex of the person.\n\nAlthough given names appear before family names in most Romanian contexts, official documents invert the order, ostensibly for filing purposes. Correspondingly, Romanians occasionally introduce themselves with their family names first, e.g. a student signing a test paper in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbiic.gov/public/2008/nov/Naming_practice_guide_UK_2006.pdf|title=A Guide to Names and Naming Practices|last=United Kingdom|first=|date=March 2006|website=Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nRomanians bearing names of non-Romanian origin often adopt Romanianised versions of their ancestral surnames. For example, ''Jurovschi'' for Polish ''[[\u017burowski]]'', or [[Popovici]] for Serbian [[Popovi\u0107]] (\"son of a priest\"), which preserves the original pronunciation of the surname through transliteration. In some cases, these changes were mandated by the state.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{See also|Turkish name#Surnames}}\n\nIn Turkey, following the [[Surname Law]] imposed in 1934 in the context of [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms]], every family living in Turkey was given a family name. The surname was generally selected by the elderly people of the family and could be any [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word (or a permitted word for families belonging to official minority groups).\n\nSome of the most common family names in Turkey are ''[[Y\u0131lmaz]]'' ('undaunted'), ''[[Do\u011fan]]'' ('falcon'), ''[[\u015eahin]]'' ('hawk'), ''[[Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (disambiguation)|Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m]]'' ('thunderbolt'), ''[[\u015eim\u015fek]]'' ('lightning'), ''[[\u00d6zt\u00fcrk]]'' ('purely Turkish').\n\n[[Patronymic]] surnames do not necessarily refer to ancestry, or in most cases cannot be traced back historically. The most usual Turkish patronymic suffix is ''\u2013o\u011flu''; ''\u2013ov(a)'', ''\u2013yev(a)'' and ''\u2013zade'' also occur in the surnames of Azeri or other Turkic descendants.\n\nOfficial minorities like Armenians, Greeks, and Jews have surnames in their own mother languages.\nThe Armenian families living in Turkey usually have Armenian surnames and generally have the suffix ''\u2013yan'', ''\u2013ian'', or, using Turkish spelling, ''-can''. Greek descendants usually have Greek surnames which might have Greek suffixes like ''\u2013ou'', ''\u2013aki(s)'', ''\u2013poulos/poulou'', ''\u2013idis/idou'', ''\u2013iadis/iadou'' or prefixes like ''papa\u2013''.\nThe Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain and settled in Turkey in 1492 have both Jewish/Hebrew surnames, and Spanish surnames, usually indicating their native regions, cities or villages back in Spain, like ''De Leon'' or ''Toledano''.\n\nHowever these minorities increasingly tend to \"Turkicize\" their surnames or replace their original surnames with Turkish surnames altogether to avoid being recognized and discriminated against.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|Appendix:Names}}\n\n{{Personal names by culture}}\n{{Personal names}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family name}}\n[[Category:Family|Name]]\n[[Category:Surname]]\n[[Category:Surnames by culture| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Laws and customs}}\n[[Surname]] conventions and [[Surname law|law]]s vary around the world.

For example, if ''Ana Laura Melachenko'' and ''Emanuel Dar\u00edo Guerrero'' had a daughter named ''Adabel Anah\u00ed'', her full name could be ''[[Adabel Guerrero|Adabel Anah\u00ed Guerrero Melachenko]]''. Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their [[Maiden and married names|birth family names]] instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining \"''de''\" and her husband's surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become ''Paula Segovia de Cossia'' or ''Paula Cossia''.\n\nThere are some province offices where a married woman can use only her birth name, and some others where she has to use the complete name, for legal purposes. The Argentine Civilian Code states both uses are correct, but police offices and passports are issued with the complete name. Today most women prefer to maintain their birth name given that \"de\" can be interpreted as meaning they belong to their husbands.\n\nWhen Eva Duarte married [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]], she could be addressed as Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n, but the preferred style was [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], or the familiar and affectionate ''Evita'' (little Eva).\n\nCombined names come from old traditional families and are considered one last name, but are rare. Although Argentina is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country, it is also composed of other [[demographics of Argentina|varied European influences]], such as Italian, French, Russian, German, etc.\n\nChildren typically use their fathers' last names only. Some state offices have started to use both last names, in the traditional father then mother order, to reduce the risk of a person being mistaken for others using the same name combinations, e.g. if Eva Duarte and Juan Per\u00f3n had a child named Juan, he might be misidentified if he were called ''Juan Per\u00f3n'', but not if he was known as Juan Per\u00f3n Duarte.\n\nIn early 2008, some new legislation is under consideration that will place the mother's last name ahead the father's last name, as it is done in [[Married and maiden names#Portuguese-speaking world|Portuguese-speaking]] countries and only optionally in Spain, despite Argentina being a Spanish-speaking country.\n\n===Chile===\nIn [[Chile]], marriage has no effect at all on either of the spouses' names, so people keep their birth names for all their life, no matter how many times marital status, theirs or that of their parents, may change. However, in some upper-class circles or in older couples, even though considered to be old-fashioned, it is still customary for a wife to use her husband's name as reference, as in \"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s de Ram\u00edrez\" (literally Lady Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s (wife) of Ram\u00edrez).\n\nChildren will always bear the surname of the father followed by that of the mother, but if there is no known father and the mother is single, the children can bear either both of her mother's surnames or the mother's first surname followed by any of the surnames of the mother's parents or grandparents, or the child may bear the mother's first surname twice in a row.\n\n{{see also|#The Philippines}}\n\n==French-speaking countries==\n'''France''' {{details|French name}}\n'''Belgium''' {{details|Walloon name}}\n'''Canadian''' {{details|Canadian name}}\n\n==German-speaking countries==\n{{details|German family name etymology}}\n\nThere are about 1,000,000{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} different family names in German. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. Hyphenations notwithstanding, they mostly consist of a single word; in those rare cases where the family name is linked to the given names by particles such as ''von'' or ''zu'', they usually indicate [[nobility|noble]] [[ancestry]]. Not all noble families used these names (see [[Riedesel]]), while some farm families, particularly in [[Westphalia]], used the particle ''von'' or ''zu'' followed by their farm or former farm's name as a family name (see ''Meyer zu Erpen'').\n\nFamily names in German-speaking countries are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: in parts of Austria and Bavaria and the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic-speaking]] areas, the family name is regularly put in front of the first given name. Also in many \u2013 especially [[rural]] \u2013 parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]]: ''R\u00fcters Erich'', for example, would be Erich of the R\u00fcter family.\n\nIn Germany today, upon marriage, both partners can choose to keep their birth name or choose either partner's name as the common name. In the latter case the partner whose name wasn't chosen can keep his birth name hyphenated to the new name (e.g. ''Schmidt'' and ''Meyer'' choose to marry under the name ''Meyer''. The former ''Schmidt'' can choose to be called ''Meyer'', ''Schmidt-Meyer'' or ''Meyer-Schmidt''), but any children will only get the single common name. In the case that both partners keep their birth name they must decide on one of the two family names for all their future children. ([[German name]])\n\nChanging one's family name for reasons other than marriage, divorce or adoption is possible only if the application is approved by the responsible government agency. Permission will usually be granted if:\n* the old name is very common and leads to confusion;\n* the old name is overly long or very difficult to spell or pronounce (especially with names of former nobility and of citizens with non-German ancestry); or\n* the old name has negative connotations or is easily ridiculed.\n\nOtherwise, name changes will normally not be granted.\n\n==Portuguese-speaking countries==\n{{main article|Surname#Portuguese-speaking countries}}\n{{further|Portuguese name}}\n\n==Dutch-speaking countries==\n{{Main article|Dutch name}}\nThe '''Netherlands''' and '''Belgium''' ([[Flanders]])\n\n==Scandinavia==\n{{further|Scandinavian family name etymology}}\nIn Scandinavia, family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is ''-sen'', as in ''Karlsen''. Names ending with ''dotter/datter'' (daughter), such as ''Olofsdotter'', are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's father does not have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familiestyrelsen.dk/navne/ |title=Familiestyrelsen: Navne |publisher=Familiestyrelsen.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlss\u00f8n or Annas\u00f8n and a daughter Karlsdatter or Annasdatter.\n\nBefore the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather (e.g. Earl [[Birger jarl|Birger Magnusson]] ''[[Folkung]]e''{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} <!-- He was never named like that during his lifetime. -->) or to the family's [[coat of arms]] (e.g. King [[Gustav Vasa|Gustav Eriksson]] ''[[House of Vasa|Vasa]]''). In many surviving family noble names, such as ''Silfversparre'' (\"silver chevron\"; in modern spelling, ''Silver-'') or ''Stiernhielm'' (\"star-helmet\"; in modernized spelling, ''stj\u00e4rnhj\u00e4lm''), the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged. (Some names from relatively modern times also use archaic or otherwise aberrant spelling as a stylistic trait; e.g. ''-quist'' instead of standard ''-kvist'' \"twig\" or ''-gr\u00e9n'' instead of standard ''-gren'', \"branch\".)\n\nLater on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish ''Bergman'' (\"mountain man\"), ''Holmberg'' (\"island mountain\"), ''Lindgren'' (\"linden branch\"), ''Sandstr\u00f6m'' (\"sand stream\") and ''\u00c5kerlund'' (\"field meadow\") were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.\nAnother common practice was to adopt one's place of origin as a middle or surname.\n\nEven more important a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, to develop a system under which each individual had a \"stable\" name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This is part of the origin, in this part of the world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a change of address, and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father's name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. [[Einar Gerhardsen]], the Norwegian [[prime minister]], used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many [[working class|working-class]] families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.\n\nThese names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of last names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffixes like ''-b\u00f8'', ''-rud'', ''-heim/-um'', ''-land'' or ''-set'' (these being examples from Norway). In Denmark, the most common suffix is ''-gaard'' \u2014 the modern spelling is ''g\u00e5rd'' in Danish and can be either ''g\u00e5rd'' or ''gard'' in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably ''[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'' (combined by the words \"kirke/kierke\" (= church) and \"gaard\" (= farm) meaning \"the farm located by the Church\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mydanishroots.com/surnames/deriving_from_a_farmstead.html |author=MyDanishRoots.com |title=Surnames deriving from a farmstead }}</ref> It is, however, a common misunderstanding that the name relates to its direct translation: churchyard/cemetery), but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners' domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.<ref>[http://www.nndata.no/home/jborgos/names.htm ''Norwegian Naming Patterns'' (Johan I. Borgos)]</ref>\n\nIn many cases, names were taken from the nature around them. In Norway, for instance, there is an abundance of surnames based on coastal geography, with suffixes like ''-strand'', ''-\u00f8y'', ''-holm'', ''-vik'', ''-fjord'' or ''-nes''. Like the names derived from farms, most of these family names reflected the family's place of residence at the time the family name was \"fixed\", however. A family name such as Swedish ''Dahlgren'' is derived from \"dahl\" meaning valley and \"gren\" meaning branch; or similarly ''[[Upvall family|Upvall]]'' meaning \"upper-valley\"; It depends on the Scandinavian country, language, and dialect.<ref>[http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/genealogy/naming.htm ''Norwegian Names'' (Norwegian-American Historical Association)]</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main article|Swedish name}}\n\nIn [[Scandinavia]] family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames in a similar fashion to that of the [[gentry]]. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish ''Bergman'' (\"mountain man\"), ''Holmberg'' (\"island mountain\"), ''Lindgren'' (\"linden branch\"), ''Sandstr\u00f6m'' (\"sand stream\") and ''\u00c5kerlund'' (\"field grove\") were quite frequent and remain common today.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main article|Finnish name}}\n\nFinland including [[Karelia]] and [[Estonia]] was the eastern part of The Kingdom of Sweden from its unification around 1100\u20131200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly [[Finnish People|Finnish]] (increasing) and [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] (decreasing) surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the ''Finnish'' in Finland: the [[West Finnish]] and the [[East Finnish]]. The surname traditions of ''Swedish-speaking'' farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of ''[[Sami people|Sami]]'' and ''[[Finnish Romani|Romani people]]'' have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.\n\nUntil the mid 20th Century, Finland was a predominantly [[agriculture|agrarian]] society, and the names of West [[Finnish people|Finns]] were based on their association with a particular area, [[farm]], or [[Smallholding|homestead]], e.g. ''Jaakko Jussila'' (\"Jaakko from the farm of Jussi\"). On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the [[Savonian people|Savonians]] pursued [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families, e.g. ''Ik\u00e4valko'', ''Termonen'', ''Pentik\u00e4inen''. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the name of the former or current place of living (e.g. ''Puumalainen'' < [[Puumala]]). In the East Finnish tradition, the women carried the family name of their fathers in female form (e.g. ''Puumalatar'' < ''Puumalainen''). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of the West-European surname tradition.\n\nIn Western Finland, agrarian names dominated, and the last name of the person was usually given according to the farm or holding they lived on. In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, the agrarian names were usually adopted as surnames. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes ''Ala-'' (Sub-) or ''Yl\u00e4-'' (Up-), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding. (e.g. ''Yli-Ojanper\u00e4'', ''Ala-Verronen''). The Swedish speaking farmers along the coast of \u00d6sterbotten usually used two surnames \u2013 one which pointed out the father's name (e.g. ''Eriksson'', ''Andersson'', ''Johansson'') and one which related to the farm or the land their family or bigger family owned or had some connection to (e.g. ''Holm'', ''Fant'', ''Westerg\u00e5rd'', ''Kloo''). So a full name could be ''Johan Karlsson Kvist'', for his daughter ''Elvira Johansdotter Kvist'', and when she married a man with the Ahlskog farm, Elvira kept the first surname Johansdotter but changed the second surname to her husbands (e.g. ''Elvira Johansdotter Ahlskog''). During the 20th century they started to drop the -son surname while they kept the second. So in Western Finland the Swedish speaking had names like ''Johan Varg'', ''Karl Viskas'', ''Sebastian Byskata'' and ''Elin Loo'', while the Swedes in Sweden at the other side of the Baltic Sea kept surnames ending with ''-son'' (e.g. ''Johan Eriksson'', ''Thor Andersson'', ''Anna-Karin Johansson'').\n\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced in south Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes, which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in the case of clergy) Latin surname. In the case of [[Swedish allotment system|enlisted soldiers]], the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process, and especially the political movement of [[fennicization]], caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings ''-o/\u00f6'', ''-nen'' (''Meri\u00f6'' < ''Meri'' \"sea\", ''Nieminen'' < ''Niemi'' \"point\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (''Paasivirta'' < ''H\u00e4llstr\u00f6m'').<ref>The whole section is based on the article Paikkala, S.

Retrieved 11-6-2007. {{in lang|fi}}</ref>\n\nIn 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the German model. Every person is legally obligated to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. The Finnish married couple may adopt the name of either spouse, or either spouse (or both spouses) may decide to use a double name. The parents may choose either surname or the double surname for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname.<ref>[http://www.mol.fi/mol/fi/99_pdf/fi/04_maahanmuutto/07_aineistot_kirjasto/01_esitteet/tasarv/tasarv_eng.pdf Equality in Finland: Information for immigrants]</ref> All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or is in use by any person residing in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors if they can prove such claim.<ref>The information here is taken from the Finnish [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 ''Nimilaki (694/1985)] (Name Act). Retrieved 11-6-2007.</ref> Some immigrants have had difficulty naming their children, as they must choose from an approved list based on the family's household language.\n\nIn the Finnish language, both the root of the surname and the first name can be modified by [[consonant gradation]] regularly when inflected to a case.\n\n===Iceland===\n{{details|topic=Naming conventions of Iceland|Icelandic name}}\n\nIn [[Iceland]], most people have no family name; a person's last name is most commonly a patronymic, i.e. derived from the father's first name. For example, when a man called ''Karl'' has a daughter called ''Anna'' and a son called ''Magn\u00fas'', their full names will typically be ''Anna Karlsd\u00f3ttir'' (\"Karl's daughter\") and ''Magn\u00fas Karlsson'' (\"Karl's son\"). The name is not changed upon marriage.\n\n==Slavic world==\n{{main article|Slavic names|Slavic name suffixes|Eastern Slavic naming customs}}\n\nSlavic countries are noted for having masculine and feminine versions for many (but not all) of their names. In most countries the use of a feminine form is obligatory in official documents as well as in other communication, except for foreigners. In some countries only the male form figures in official use (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia), but in communication (speech, print) a feminine form is often used.\n\nIn '''Slovenia''' the last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used.\n\nIf the name has no suffix, it may or may not have a feminine version. Sometimes it has the ending changed (such as the addition of ''-a''). In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, suffixless names, such as those of German origin, are feminized by adding ''-ov\u00e1'' (for example, ''Schusterov\u00e1'').\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main article|Bulgarian name}}\n[[Bulgaria]]n names usually consist of three components \u2013 given name, patronymic (based on father's name), family name.\n\nGiven names have many variations, but the most common names have Christian/Greek (e.g. [[wikt:Maria|Maria]], [[wikt:Ivan|Ivan]], [[wikt:Christo|Christo]], Peter, [[wikt:Pavel|Pavel]]), [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] (Ognyan, [[wikt:Miroslav|Miroslav]], [[wikt:Tihomir|Tihomir]]) or [[Bulgars|Protobulgarian]] (Krum, [[wikt:Asparukh|Asparukh]]) (pre-Christian) origin.\nFather's names normally consist of the father's first name and the \"-ov\" (male) or \"-ova\" (female) or \"-ovi\" (plural) suffix.\n\nFamily names usually also end with the \"-ov\", \"-ev\" (male) or \"-ova\", \"-eva\" (female) or \"-ovi\", \"-evi\" (plural) suffix.\n\nIn many cases (depending on the name root) the suffixes can be also \"-ski\" (male and plural) or \"-ska\" (female); \"-ovski\", \"-evski\" (male and plural) or \"-ovska\", \"-evska\" (female); \"-in\" (male) or \"-ina\" (female) or \"-ini\" (plural); etc.\n\nThe meaning of the suffixes is similar to the English word \"of\", expressing membership in/belonging to a family.\nFor example, the family name Ivanova means a person belonging to the Ivanovi family.\n\nA father's name Petr*ov* means son of Peter.\n\nRegarding the different meaning of the suffixes, \"-ov\", \"-ev\"/\"-ova\", \"-eva\" are used for expressing relationship to the father and \"-in\"/\"-ina\" for relationship to the mother (often for orphans whose father is dead).\n\n===Czech Republic and Slovakia===\n{{Main article|Czech name|Slovak name}}\n\nNames of [[Czechs|Czech people]] consist of given name (''k\u0159estn\u00ed jm\u00e9no'') and surname (''p\u0159\u00edjmen\u00ed''). Usage of the second or middle name is not common. Feminine names are usually derived from masculine ones by a suffix ''-ov\u00e1'' (''Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1'') or ''-\u00e1'' for names being originally adjectives (''Vesel\u00e1''), sometimes with a little change of original name's ending (''Sedl\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1'' from ''Sedl\u00e1\u010dek'' or ''Svobodov\u00e1'' from ''Svoboda''). Women usually change their family names when they get married. The family names are usually [[noun]]s (''Svoboda'', ''Kr\u00e1l'', ''R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka'', ''Dvo\u0159\u00e1k'', ''Bene\u0161''), [[adjective]]s (''Novotn\u00fd'', ''\u010cern\u00fd'', ''Vesel\u00fd'') or past participles of [[verb]]s (''Posp\u00ed\u0161il''). There are also a couple of names with more complicated origin which are actually complete sentences (''Sko\u010ddopole'', ''Hrejsemnou'' or ''V\u00edt\u00e1mv\u00e1s''). The most common Czech family name is ''Nov\u00e1k'' / ''Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1''.\n\nIn addition, many Czechs and some Slovaks have German surnames due to mixing between the ethnic groups over the past thousand years. Deriving women's names from German and other foreign names is often problematic since foreign names do not suit [[Czech language]] rules, although most commonly ''-ov\u00e1'' is simply added (''Schmidtov\u00e1''; umlauts are often, but not always, dropped, e.g. ''M\u00fcllerov\u00e1''), or the German name is respelled with Czech spelling (''\u0160mitov\u00e1''). Hungarian names, which can be found fairly commonly among Slovaks, can also be either left unchanged (Hungarian ''Nagy'', fem. ''Nagyov\u00e1'') or respelled according to Czech/Slovak orthography (masc. ''Na\u010f'', fem. ''Na\u010fov\u00e1'').\n\n===Poland===\n{{Main article|Polish name}}\n\nIn Poland and most of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics. Thus, early surnames indicating occupation include ''Karczmarz'' (\"innkeeper\"), ''Kowal'' (\"blacksmith\"), \"Z\u0142otnik\" (\"gold smith\") and ''Bednarczyk'' (\"young cooper\"), while those indicating patronymic descent include ''Szczepaniak'' (\"Son of ''Szczepan''), ''J\u00f3zefowicz'' (\"Son of ''J\u00f3zef''), and ''Ka\u017amirkiewicz'' (\"Son of ''Kazimierz''\"). Similarly, early surnames like ''Mazur'' (\"the one from [[Masuria|Mazury]]\") indicated geographic origin, while ones like ''Nowak'' (\"the new one\"), ''Bia\u0142y'' (\"the pale one\"), and ''Wielgus'' (\"the big one\") indicated personal characteristics.\n\nIn the early 16th century, ( the [[Polish Renaissance]]), toponymic names became common, especially among the [[szlachta|nobility]]. Initially, the surnames were in a form of \"[first name] ''z'' (\"de\", \"of\") [location]\". Later, most surnames were changed to adjective forms, e.g. ''Jakub Wi\u015blicki'' (\"James of [[Wi\u015blica]]\") and ''[[Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki (disambiguation)|Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki]]'' (\"''Zbigniew'' of [[Olesnica|Ole\u015bnica]]\"), with masculine [[suffix (linguistics)|suffixes]] ''-ski'', ''-cki'', ''-dzki'' and ''-icz'' or respective feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', ''-dzka'' and ''-icz'' on the east of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Names formed this way are adjectives grammatically, and therefore change their form depending on sex; for example, ''Jan Kowalski'' and ''Maria Kowalska'' collectively use the plural ''Kowalscy''.\n\nNames with masculine suffixes ''-ski'', ''-cki'', and ''-dzki'', and corresponding feminine suffixes ''-ska'', ''-cka'', and ''-dzka'' became associated with noble origin. Many people from lower classes successively changed their surnames to fit this pattern. This produced many ''Kowalski''s, ''Bednarski''s, ''Kaczmarski''s and so on.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA separate class of surnames derive from the names of [[szlachta|noble clans]]. These are used either as separate names or the first part of a double-barrelled name. Thus, persons named ''Jan Nieczuja'' and ''Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki'' might be related. Similarly, after World War I and World War II, many members of [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground organizations]] adopted their [[nom de guerre|war-time pseudonyms]] as the first part of their surnames. ''Edward Rydz'' thus became [[Marshal of Poland]] ''[[Edward Smigly-Rydz|Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz]]'' and ''Zdzis\u0142aw Jeziora\u0144ski'' became ''[[Jan Nowak-Jezioranski|Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]]''.\n\n===Russia===\nA full [[Russians|Russian]] name consists of personal (given) name, patronymic, and family name (surname).\n\nMost Russian family names originated from patronymics, that is, father's name usually formed by adding the adjective suffix ''-ov(a)'' or ''-ev(a)''. Contemporary patronymics, however, have a substantive suffix ''-ich'' for masculine and the adjective suffix ''-na'' for feminine.\n\nFor example, the proverbial triad of most common Russian surnames follows:\n* ''Ivan'''ov''''' (son of Ivan),\n* ''Petr'''ov''''' (son of Peter),\n* ''Sidor'''ov''''' (son of Sidor).\n\nFeminine forms of these surnames have the ending ''-a'':\n* ''Ivan'''ova''''' (daughter of Ivan),\n* ''Petr'''ova''''' (daughter of Peter),\n* ''Sidor'''ova''''' (daughter of Sidor).\n\nSuch a pattern of name formation is not unique to Russia or even to the Eastern and Southern Slavs in general; quite common are also names derived from professions, places of origin, and personal characteristics, with various suffixes (e.g. ''-in(a)'' and ''-sky (-skaya)'').\n\nProfessions:\n* ''kuznets'' ([[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]) \u2192 ''Kuznetsov''\u2014''Kuznetsova''\n* ''portnoi'' ([[tailor]]) \u2192 ''Portnov''\u2014''Portnova''\n* ''pastukh'' ([[shepherd]]) \u2192 ''Pastukhov''\u2014''Pastukhova''.\n\nPlaces of origin:\n* ''Moskva'' (Moscow) \u2192 ''Moskvin''\u2014''Moskvina'', ''Moskovsky''\u2014''Moskovskaya'',\n* ''Smolensk'' \u2192 ''Smolensky''\u2014''Smolenskaya'',\n* ''Riazan'' \u2192 ''Riazanov''\u2014''Riazanova'', ''Riazantsev''\u2014''Riazantseva''.\n\nPersonal characteristics:\n* ''tolsty'' (stout, fat) \u2192 ''Tolstov''\u2014''Tolstova'', ''Tolstoy''\u2014''Tolstaya'',\n* ''nos'' (nose) \u2192 ''Nosov''\u2014''Nosova'',\n* ''sedoi'' (grey-haired or -headed) \u2192 ''Sedov''\u2014''Sedova''.\n\nA considerable number of \"artificial\" names exists, for example, those given to seminary graduates; such names were based on [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church]] or Christian virtues.\n\nGreat Orthodox Feasts:\n* ''rozhdestvo'' (Christmas) \u2192 ''Rozhdestvensky''\u2014''Rozhdestvenskaya'',\n* ''voskresenie'' (Resurrection) \u2192 ''Voskresensky''\u2014''Voskresenskaya'',\n* ''uspenie'' (Assumption) \u2192 ''Uspensky''\u2014''Uspenskaya''.\n\nChristian virtues:\n* ''philagathos'' (one who loves goodness) \u2192 ''Dobrolubov''\u2014''Dobrolubova'', ''Dobrolubsky''\u2014''Dobrolubskaya'',\n* ''philosophos'' (one who loves wisdom) \u2192 ''Lubomudrov''\u2014''Lubomudrova'',\n* ''theophilos'' (one who loves God) \u2192 ''Bogolubov''\u2014''Bogolubova''.\n\nMany freed serfs were given surnames after those of their former owners. For example, a serf of the [[Demidov]] family might be named ''Demidovsky'', which translates roughly as \"belonging to Demidov\" or \"one of Demidov's bunch\".\n\nGrammatically, Russian family names follow the same rules as other nouns or adjectives (names ending with ''-oy'', ''-aya'' are grammatically adjectives), with exceptions: some names do not change in different cases and have the same form in both genders (for example, ''Sedykh'', ''Lata'').\n\n===South Slavs===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\n\n==== Endings in -i\u0107 and -i\u010d ====\nSurnames of some [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] groups such as [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], and [[Bosniaks]] traditionally end with the suffixes \"-i\u0107\" and \"-vi\u0107\" (often transliterated to English and other western languages as \"ic\", \"ich\", \"vic\" or \"vich\". The v is added in the case of a name to which \"-i\u0107\" is appended would otherwise end with a vowel, to avoid double vowels with the \"i\" in \"-i\u0107\".) These are a diminutive indicating descent i.e. \"son of\". In some cases the family name was derived from a profession (e.g. blacksmith \u2013 \"Kova\u010d\" \u2192 \"Kova\u010devi\u0107\").\n\nAn analogous ending is also common in [[Slovenia]]. As the [[Slovenian language]] does not have the softer consonant \"\u0107\", in Slovene words and names only \"\u010d\" is used. So that people from the former [[Yugoslavia]] need not change their names, in official documents \"\u0107\" is also allowed (as well as \"\u0110 / \u0111\"). Thus, one may have two surname variants, e.g.: Bo\u017ei\u010d, Tom\u0161i\u010d (Slovenian origin or assimilated) and Bo\u017ei\u0107, Tom\u0161i\u0107 (roots from the Serbo-Croat language continuum area). Slovene names ending in -i\u010d do not necessarily have a patrimonial origin.\n\nIn general family names in all of these countries follow this pattern with some family names being typically Serbian, some typically Croat and yet others being common throughout the whole linguistic region.\n\nChildren usually inherit their fathers' family name. In an older naming convention which was common in [[Serbia]] up until the mid-19th century, a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from the father's personal name, and the family name, as seen, for example, in the name of the language reformer [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]].\n\nOfficial family names do not have distinct male or female forms, except in Macedonia, though a somewhat archaic unofficial form of adding suffixes to family names to form female form persists, with ''-eva'', implying \"daughter of\" or \"female descendant of\" or ''-ka'', implying \"wife of\" or \"married to\". In Slovenia the feminine form of a surname (\"-eva\" or \"-ova\") is regularly used in non-official communication (speech, print), but not for official IDs or other legal documents.\n\nBosniak Muslim names follow the same formation pattern but are usually derived from proper names of Islamic origin, often combining archaic Islamic or feudal Turkish titles i.e. Mulaomerovi\u0107, \u0160abanovi\u0107, Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107, etc. Also related to Islamic influence is the prefix ''[[Hajji|Had\u017ei]]-'' found in some family names. Regardless of religion, this prefix was derived from the honorary title which a distinguished ancestor earned by making a pilgrimage to either Christian or Islamic holy places; Had\u017eibegi\u0107, being a Bosniak Muslim example, and Had\u017eianti\u0107 an Orthodox Christian one.\n\nIn [[Croatia]] where tribal affiliations persisted longer, [[Lika]], [[Herzegovina]] etc., originally a family name, came to signify practically all people living in one area, clan land or holding of the nobles. The [[\u0160ubi\u0107]] family owned land around the [[Zrin River]] in the Central Croatian region of [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]]. The surname became [[\u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]], the most famous being [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]].\n\nIn Montenegro and Herzegovina, family names came to signify all people living within one clan or [[Tribes of Montenegro|bratstvo]]. As there exists a strong tradition of inheriting personal names from grandparents to grandchildren, an additional patronymic usually using suffix ''-ov'' had to be introduced to make distinctions between two persons bearing the same personal name and the same family name and living within same area. A noted example is [[Marko Miljanov Popovi\u0107]], i.e. Marko, son of Miljan, from Popovi\u0107 family.\n\nDue to discriminatory laws in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], some Serb families of [[Vojvodina]] discarded the suffix ''-i\u0107'' in an attempt to mask their ethnicity and avoid heavy taxation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe prefix ''Pop-'' in Serbian names indicates descent from a priest, for example [[Gordana Pop Lazi\u0107]], i.e. descendant of Pop Laza.\n\nSome Serbian family names include prefixes of Turkish origin, such as ''Uzun-'' meaning tall, or ''Kara-'', black. Such names were derived from nicknames of family ancestors. A famous example is [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], descendants of \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, known as [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] or Black \u0110or\u0111e.\n\n====Endings -ov and -ski====\nAmong the [[Bulgarians]], another South Slavic people, the typical surname suffix is \"-ov\" (Ivanov, Kovachev), although other popular suffixes also exist.\n\nIn [[North Macedonia]], the most popular suffix today is \"-ski\".\n\n===Slovenia===\n[[Slovenes]] have a great variety of surnames, most of them differentiated according to region. Surnames ending in -i\u010d are by far less frequent than among Croats and Serbs. There are typically Slovenian surnames ending in -i\u010d, such as Bla\u017ei\u010d, Stani\u010d, [[Maru\u0161i\u010d]]. Many Slovenian surnames, especially in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], end in -\u010di\u010d (Gregor\u010di\u010d, Kocijan\u010di\u010d, Miklav\u010di\u010d, etc.), which is uncommon for other South Slavic peoples (except the neighboring Croats, e.g. Kova\u010di\u0107, Jela\u010di\u0107, Kranj\u010di\u0107, etc.). On the other hand, surname endings in -ski and -ov are rare, they can denote a noble origin (especially for the -ski, if it completes a toponym) or a foreign (mostly Czech) origin. One of the most typical Slovene surname endings is -nik (Rupnik, Pu\u010dnik, Ple\u010dnik, Poga\u010dnik, Podobnik) and other used surname endings are -lin (Pavlin, Mehlin, Ahlin, Ferlin), -ar (Mlakar, Ravnikar, Smrekar Tisnikar) and -lj (Rugelj, Pucelj, Bagatelj, Bricelj). Many Slovenian surnames are linked to Medieval rural settlement patterns. Surnames like [[Novak]] (literally, \"the new one\") or Hribar (from ''hrib'', hill) were given to the peasants settled in newly established farms, usually in high mountains. Peasant families were also named according to the owner of the land which they cultivated: thus, the surname Kralj (King) or Cesar (Emperor) was given to those working on royal estates, \u0160kof (Bishop) or Vidmar to those working on ecclesiastical lands, etc. Many Slovenian surnames are named after animals (Medved \u2013 bear, Volk, Vovk or Vouk \u2013 wolf, Golob \u2013 pigeon, Strnad - yellowhammer, Orel \u2013 eagle, Lisjak \u2013 fox, or Zajec \u2013 rabbit, etc.) or plants P\u0161enica - wheat, Slak - bindweed, Hrast - oak, etc. Many are named after neighbouring peoples: [[Horvat]], Hrovat, or Hrovatin (Croat), Furlan ([[Friulian language|Friulian]]), Nemec (German), Lah (Italian), Vogrin, Vogri\u010d or Vogrin\u010di\u010d (Hungarian), Vo\u0161njak (Bosnian), \u010ceh (Czech), Turk (Turk), or different Slovene regions: Kranjc, Kranjec or Krajnc (from [[Carniola]]), Kra\u0161evec (from the [[Karst Plateau|Kras]]), Koro\u0161ec (from [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]), Ko\u010devar or Ho\u010devar (from the [[Gottschee|Gottschee county]]).\n\n=====Use of feminine surnames in Slovenia=====\nIn '''Slovenia''' last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used. Examples: Novak (m.) & Novakova (f.), Kralj (m.) & Kraljeva (f.), Mali (m.) & Malijeva (f.). Usually surenames on -ova are used together with the title/gender: gospa Novakova (Mrs. Novakova), gospa Kraljeva (Mrs. Kraljeva), gospodi\u010dna Malijeva (Miss Malijeva, if unmarried), etc or with the name.  So we have Maja Novak on the ID card and Novakova Maja (extremely rarely Maja Novak'''ova''') in communication; Tja\u0161a Mali and Malijeva Tja\u0161a (rarely Tja\u0161a Malij'''eva'''); respectively. Diminutive forms of last names for females are also available: Novakovka, Kraljevka. As for pronunciation, in Slovenian there is some leeway regarding accentuation. Depending on the region or local usage, you may have either N\u00f3vak & N\u00f3vakova or, more frequently, Nov\u00e1k & Nov\u00e1kova. Accent marks are normally not used.\n\n{{further|Bulgarian name|Croatian name|Serbian name|Macedonian names}}\n\n===Ukraine and Belarus===\n{{Main article|Ukrainian name}}\n\nUkrainian and Belarusian names evolved from the same [[Old East Slavic]] and [[Ruthenian language]] (western [[Rus' (people)|Rus']]) origins. Ukrainian and Belarusian names share many characteristics with family names from other Slavic cultures. Most prominent are the shared root words and suffixes. For example, the root ''koval'' (blacksmith) compares to the Polish ''[[Kowalski|kowal]]'', and the root ''bab'' (woman) is shared with Polish, Slovakian, and Czech. The suffix ''-vych'' (son of) corresponds to the South Slavic ''-vic'', the Russian ''-vich'', and the Polish ''-wicz'', while ''-sky'', ''-ski'', and ''-ska'' are shared with both Polish and Russian, and ''-ak'' with Polish.\n\nHowever some suffixes are more uniquely characteristic to Ukrainian and Belarusian names, especially: ''-chuk'' ([[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]]), ''-enko'' (all other Ukraine) (both son of), ''-ko'' (little [masculine]), ''-ka'' (little [feminine]), ''-shyn'', and ''-uk''. See, for example, [[Mihalko]], Ukrainian Presidents [[Leonid Kravchuk]], and [[Viktor Yushchenko]], Belarusian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]], or former Soviet diplomat [[Andrei Gromyko]]. Such Ukrainian and Belarusian names can also be found in Russia, Poland, or even other Slavic countries (e.g. Croatian general [[Zvonimir \u010cervenko]]), but are due to importation by Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Rusyn ancestors.\n\n==Arabic-speaking countries==\n{{Main article|Arabic name}}\n\nThe given name is always followed by the father's first name, then the father's family surname.\nSome surnames have a prefix of ''ibn''- meaning son of (''ould''- in Mauritania)\nThe surnames follow similar rules defining a relation to a clan, family, place etc.\nSome Arab countries have differences due to historic rule by the Ottoman Empire or due to being a different minority.\n\nA large number of Arabic last names start with \"Al-\" which means \"The\"\n\n'''Arab States of the [[Persian Gulf]]'''.\nNames mainly consist of the person's name followed by the father's first name connected by the word \"ibn\" or \"bin\" (meaning \"son of\"). The last name either refers to the name of the tribe the person belongs to, or to the region, city, or town he/she originates from. In exceptional cases, members of the royal families or ancient tribes mainly, the title (usually H.M./H.E., Prince, or Sheikh) is included in the beginning as a prefix, and the first name can be followed by four names, his father, his grandfather, and great \u2013 grandfather, as a representation of the purity of blood and to show the pride one has for his ancestry.\n\nIn Arabic-speaking [[Levant]]ine countries ([[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]]) it's common to have family names associated with a certain profession or craft, such as \"Al-Haddad\"/\"Haddad\" which means \"Blacksmith\" or \"Al-Najjar\"/\"Najjar\" which means \"Carpenter\".\n\n==South Asia==\n{{further|Indian family names|Pakistani name|Bangladeshi name|List of popular surnames in Nepal}}\n\n===India===\n{{Main article|Indian name}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn India, surnames are placed as last names or before first names, which often denote: village of origin, caste, clan, office of authority their ancestors held, or trades of their ancestors.\n\nThe largest variety of surnames is found in the states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]], which numbers more than the rest of India together. Here surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father's name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived from the place where the family lived, with the 'ker' (Marathi) or 'Kar'(Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaiker, Puneker, Aurangabadker or Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in 'e'. These are usually more archaic than the 'Kar's and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.\n\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]], surnames usually denote family names. It is easy to track family history and the caste they belonged to using a surname.\n\nIn [[Odisha]] and [[West bengal]],  surnames denote the cast they belong. There are also several local surnames like [[Das (surname)|Das]], [[Patnaik]], [[Mohanty]], [[Jena (surname)|Jena]] etc\n\nIt is a common in [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]], and some other parts of [[South India]] that the [[spouse]] adopts her husband's [[first name]] instead of his family or surname name after marriage.<ref>[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Indian-Culture-2871/2010/11/NAME-CHANGE-MARRIAGE.htm]</ref>\n\nIndia is a country with numerous distinct cultural and linguistic groups. Thus, Indian surnames, where formalized, fall into seven general types.\n\nSurnames are based on:\n* Patronymics and ancestry, whereby the father's name or an ancestor's given name is used in its original form or in a derived form (e.g. [[Baranwal]] or Barnwal or Burnwal derived from the ancestor Ahibaran).\n* Occupations (Chamar, [[Patel]] or Patil, meaning Village Headman, [[Gandhi (surname)|Gandhi]], [[Kamath]], [[Kulkarni]], who used to maintain the accounts and records and collect taxes, [[Kapadia (disambiguation)|Kapadia]], Nadkarni, Patwardhan, Patwari, [[Shenoy]], etc.) and priestly distinctions (Bhat, Bhattar, Sastry, Trivedi, Shukla, Chaturvedi, Twivedi, Purohit, Mukhopadhyay); Business people: Shetty, Rai, Hegde is commonly used in kshatriya castes of the Karnataka coastal belt. In addition, many [[Parsi people|Parsi]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Bohra]] and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] families have used English trade names as last names since the 18th and 19th centuries (Contractor, Engineer, Builder).\n* [[Caste]] or clan names ([[Pillai (surname)|Pillai]], Gounder, Goud, Gowda, Boyar, Parmar, Sindhi, Vaish, Reddy, Meena and Naidu) are not surnames but suffixes to first names to indicate their clan or caste.\n* Place names or names derived from places of ancestral origin (Aluru, Marwari, Gavaskar, Gaonkar, Mangeshkar, Kapoor, [[Wamankar]], [[Kokradi]], Karnad, Sandhu,  Medukonduru, Rachapalli).\n* The father's first name is used as a surname in certain Southern states, such as [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Spouses and children take on the first name of the father as their last name or 'surname'.\n* [[Muslim]] surnames generally follow the same rules used in Pakistan. [[Khan (name)|Khan]] is among the most popular surnames, often signifying [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]]/[[Central Asian]] descent.\n* Bestowed titles or other honorifics: titles bestowed by kings, rajas, nawabs and other nobles before the British Raj (Wali, Rai, [[Rao (surname)|Rao]], [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]], [[Gain (surname)|Gain/Gayen]], Panicker, Vallikappen, Moocken, etc.) and those bestowed by the British (Rai, Bahadur).\n\nThe convention is to write the first name followed by middle names and surname. It is common to use the father's first name as the middle name or last name even though it is not universal. In some Indian states like [[Maharashtra]], official documents list the family name first, followed by a comma and the given names.\n\nTraditionally, wives take the surname of their husband after marriage. In modern times, in urban areas at least, this practice is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband's surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.\n\nJains generally use [[Jain]], [[Shah]], [[Firodia]], [[Singhal]] or [[Gupta (name)|Gupta]] as their last names.\nSikhs generally use the words ''Singh'' (\"lion\") and ''Kaur'' (\"princess\") as surnames added to the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names ([[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered ([[Hukamnama]]) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use ''Singh'' in his name and any woman who considered herself a Sikh must use ''Kaur'' in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.\n\nThe modern-day spellings of names originated when families translated their surnames to English, with no standardization across the country. Variations are regional, based on how the name was translated from the local language to English in the 18th, 19th or 20th centuries during British rule. Therefore, it is understood in the local traditions that Baranwal and Barnwal represent the same name derived from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab respectively. Similarly, Tagore derives from Bengal while Thakur is from Hindi-speaking areas. The officially recorded spellings tended to become the standard for that family. In the modern times, some states have attempted standardization, particularly where the surnames were corrupted because of the early British insistence of shortening them for convenience. Thus Bandopadhyay became Banerji, Mukhopadhay became Mukherji, Chattopadhyay became Chatterji, etc. This coupled with various other spelling variations created several surnames based on the original surnames. The [[West Bengal]] Government now insists on re-converting all the variations to their original form when the child is enrolled in school.\n\nSome parts of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Indonesia]] have similar patronymic customs to those of India.\n\n===Nepal===\n{{Further|List of popular surnames in Nepal}}\n\nNepali surnames are divided into three origins; [[Indo-Aryan languages]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] and indigenous origins. Surnames of [[Khas community]] contains toponyms as [[Ghimire]], [[Dahal]], [[Pokharel]], [[Sapkota (disambiguation)|Sapkota]] from respective villages, occupational names as ([[Adhikari]], [[Bhandari]], [[Karki (surname)|Karki]], [[Thapa]]). Many Khas surnames includes suffix as -wal, -al as in [[Katwal]], Silwal, [[Dulal]], [[Khanal]], [[Khulal]], [[Rijal]]. [[Kshatriya]] titles such as [[Bista]], [[Kunwar (disambiguation)|Kunwar]], [[Rana (title)|Rana]], [[Rawat (title)|Rawat]], [[Rawal]], [[Dhami]], [[Shah]], [[Thakuri]], [[Chand (name)|Chand]], were taken as surnames by various [[Kshetri]] and [[Thakuri]]s.

Other common Terai surnames are [[Yadav]], [[Mahato]], [[Kamat]], [[Thakur (Bengali surname)|Thakur]], [[Dev (disambiguation)|Dev]], [[Chaudhary]], [[Kayastha]].\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Main article|Pakistani name|List of Pakistani family names}}\n\nPakistani surnames are basically divided in three categories: [[Pakistani name|Arab naming convention]], tribal or caste names and ancestral names.\n\nFamily names indicating [[Arab]] ancestry, e.g. [[Shaikh]], [[Siddiqui]], [[Abbasi (disambiguation)|Abbasi]], [[Syed]], [[Zaidi (surname)|Zaidi]], [[Khawaja]], [[Naqvi (disambiguation)|Naqvi]], [[Farooqi]], [[Osmani]], [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]], [[Hassani]], and [[Husseini]].\n\nPeople claiming [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ancestry include those with family names [[\u0681\u0627\u0681\u064a dz\u0101dzi]] [[Durrani]], [[Gardezi]], [[Suri (Pashtun)|Suri]], [[Yousafzai]], [[Afridi]], [[Mullagori]], [[Mohmand]], [[Khattak]], [[Wazir (disambiguation)|Wazir]], [[Mehsud]], [[Niazi]].\n\nFamily names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] heritage include [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]], (cheema) [[Baig]] or [[Baig|Beg]], [[Pasha]], [[Barlas]], and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuki]].\n\nPeople claiming Indian ancestry include those with family names [[Barelwi]], [[Lakhnavi]], [[Delhvi]], [[Godharvi]], [[Bilgrami]], and [[Muslim Rajputs|Rajput]].\n\nPeople claiming [[Iran]]ian ancestry include those with family names [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)#Other uses|Agha]], [[Bukhari (nesbat)|Bukhari]], [[Firdausi]], [[Ghazali]], [[Gilan]]i, [[Hamadani (surname)|Hamadani]], [[Isfahani]], [[Kashani]], [[Kirmani|Kermani]], [[Khorasani (disambiguation)|Khorasani]], [[Farooqui]], [[Mir]], [[Mirza]], [[Montazeri]], [[Nishapuri]], [[Noorani]], [[Kayani (name)|Kayani]], [[Qizilbash]], [[Saadi (disambiguation)|Saadi]], [[Sabzvari]], [[Shirazi (disambiguation)|Shirazi]], [[Sistani (disambiguation)|Sistani]], [[Suhrawardi (disambiguation)|Suhrawardi]], [[Yazdani (disambiguation)|Yazdani]], [[Zahedi (disambiguation)|Zahedi]], and [[Zand tribe|Zand]].\n\nTribal names include [[Abro]] [[Afaqi]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]], [[Khogyani (tribe)|Khogyani]] ([[Khogyani (tribe)|Khakwani]]), [[Amini (surname)|Amini]],[Ansari] [[Ashrafkhel]], [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]], [[Bajwa]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Barakzai]], [[Baranzai]], [[Bhatti]], [[Bhutto (clan)|Bhutto]], [[Ranjha clan|Ranjha]], [[Bijarani]], [[Bizenjo]], [[Brahui people|Brohi]], [[Khetran]], [[Bugti]], [[Butt (tribe)|Butt]], [[Farooqui]], [[Gabol]], [[Ghaznavi (surname)|Ghaznavi]], [[Ghilzai]], [[Gichki]], [[Gujjar]], [[Jamali (surname)|Jamali]], [[Jamote]], [[Janjua]], [[Jatoi (tribe)|Jatoi]], [[Jutt]] [[Joyo (tribe)|Joyo]], [[Junejo]], [[Karmazkhel]], Kayani, [[Khar (tribe)|Khar]], [[Khattak]], [[Khuhro]], [[Lakhani (name)|Lakhani]], [[Leghari tribe|Leghari]], [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodhi]], Magsi, [[Malik]], [[Mandokhel]], Mayo, [[Marwat]], [[Mengal]], Mughal, [[Palijo]], Paracha, [[Panhwar]], [[Phul]], [[Popalzai]], [[Qureshi & qusmani]], [[Rabbani (disambiguation)|Rabbani]], [[Raisani]], [[Rakhshani (disambiguation)|Rakhshani]], [[Sahi clan|Sahi]], [[Swati (tribe)|Swati]], [[Soomro]], [[Sulaimankhel]], [[Talpur]], [[Talwar]], [[Thebo]], [[Yousafzai]], and [[Zamani (disambiguation)|Zamani]].\n\nFamily names indicating [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]]/ [[Kurd]] ancestry, [[Dogar]].\nIn Pakistan, the official paperwork format regarding personal identity is as follows:\n\nSo and so, son of so and so, of such and such tribe or clan and religion and resident of such and such place. For example, Amir Khan s/o Fakeer Khan, tribe Mughal Kayani or Chauhan Rajput, Follower of religion Islam, resident of Village Anywhere, Tehsil Anywhere, District.\n\nA large number of [[Muslim Rajputs]] have retained their [[surnames]] such as [[Chauhan]], [[Rathore]], [[Parmar]], and [[Janjua]].\n\n==East Asia==\n{{further|Chinese surname|Japanese name|Korean name#Family names|Vietnamese name}}\n\nIn modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, the family name is placed before the given names, although this order may not be observed in translation. Generally speaking, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese names do not alter their order in English ([[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Ho Chi Minh]]) and Japanese names do ([[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]]).<ref>Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzKBXxnkURkC&pg=PA632 pp. 632 ff]. M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}.</ref> However, numerous exceptions exist, particularly for people born in English-speaking countries such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. This is sometimes systematized: in all Olympic events, the athletes of the [[People's Republic of China]] list their names in the Chinese ordering, while Chinese athletes representing other countries, such as the United States, use the Western ordering.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} (In Vietnam, the system is further complicated by the cultural tradition of addressing people by their given name, usually with an honorific. For example, [[Phan V\u0103n Kh\u1ea3i]] is ''properly'' addressed as Mr.&thinsp;Kh\u1ea3i, even though Phan is his family name.)\n\nChinese family names have many types of origins, some claiming dates as early as the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] (2nd millennium BC):\n* from the land or state that one lived in or awarded: [[Chen (surname)|Chen \u9673]] after the [[Chen (state)|state of Chen]], [[Cai (surname)|Cai \u8521]] after the [[state of Cai]];\n* from the given name or [[Posthumous name]] of one's ancestor: [[Zhuang (surname)|Zhuang \u838a]] after [[King Zhuang of Chu]];\n* from the [[Chinese nobility|nobility status]] or [[officer status]] of one's ancestor: [[Wang (surname)|Wang \u738b]] (a king) or [[Shi (surname)|Shi \u53f2]] (a history-recording officer);\n* and some other origins.\n\nIn history, some changed their surnames due to a [[naming taboo]] (from Zhuang \u838a to Yan \u56b4 during the era of [[Emperor Ming of Han|Liu Zhuang \u5289\u838a]]) or as an award by the Emperor ([[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]] was often to senior officers during [[Tang dynasty]]).\n\nIn modern times, some Chinese adopt an [[English name]] in addition to their native given names: e.g., {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|\u674e\u67f1\u9298}} (''Li Zh\u00f9m\u00edng'')}} adopted the English name [[Martin (name)|Martin]] Lee. Particularly in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], the convention is to write both names together: [[Martin Lee Chu-ming]]. Owing to the confusion this can cause, a further convention is sometimes observed of capitalizing the surname: Martin L{{sc|EE}} Chu-ming. Sometimes, however, the Chinese given name is forced into the Western system as a middle name (\"Martin Chu-ming Lee\"); less often, the English given name is forced into the Chinese system (\"Lee Chu-ming Martin\").\n\nIn Japan, the civil law forces a common surname for every married couple, unless in a case of international marriage. In most cases, women surrender their surnames upon marriage, and use the surnames of their husbands. However, a convention that a man uses his wife's family name if the wife is an only child is sometimes observed. A similar tradition called ''ru zhui'' (\u5165\u8d05) is common among Chinese when the bride's family is wealthy and has no son but wants the heir to pass on their assets under the same family name. The Chinese character ''zhui'' (\u8d05) carries a money [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] (\u8c9d), which implies that this tradition was originally based on financial reasons. All their offspring carry the mother's family name. If the groom is the first born with an obligation to carry his own ancestor's name, a compromise may be reached in that the first male child carries the mother's family name while subsequent offspring carry the father's family name. The tradition is still in use in many Chinese communities outside [[mainland China]], but largely disused in China because of social changes from communism. Due to the economic reform in the past decade, accumulation and inheritance of personal wealth made a comeback to the Chinese society. It is unknown if this financially motivated tradition would also come back to mainland China.\n\nIn Chinese, Korean, and Singaporean cultures, women keep their own surnames, while the family as a whole is referred to by the surnames of the husbands.\n\nIn Hong Kong, some women would be known to the public with the surnames of their husbands preceding their own surnames, such as [[Anson Chan|Anson Chan Fang On Sang]]. Anson is an English given name, On Sang is the given name in Chinese, Chan is the surname of Anson's husband, and Fang is her own surname. A name change on legal documents is not necessary. In Hong Kong's English publications, her family names would have been presented in small cap letters to resolve ambiguity, e.g. Anson C<small>HAN</small> F<small>ANG</small> On Sang in full or simply Anson Chan in short form.\n\nIn [[Macau]], some people have their names in Portuguese spelt with some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] style, such as ''Carlos do Rosario Tchiang''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carlos.com.hk/carlos.htm |title=Carlos do Rosario Tchiang (home page)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702024930/http://carlos.com.hk/carlos.htm |archivedate=2007-07-02}}</ref>\n\nChinese women in Canada, especially [[Hongkonger]]s in [[Toronto]], would preserve their [[maiden name]]s before the surnames of their husbands when written in English, for instance, Rosa Chan Leung, where Chan is the maiden name, and Leung is the surname of the husband.\n\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], surnames are predominantly monosyllabic (written with one [[Chinese characters|character]]), though a small number of common [[Chinese compound surname|disyllabic (or written with two characters) surnames]] exists (e.g. the Chinese name ''Ouyang'', the Korean name ''Jegal'' and the Vietnamese name ''Phan-Tran'').\n\nMany Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames are of the same origin, but simply pronounced differently and even transliterated differently overseas in Western nations. For example, the common Chinese surnames Chen, Chan, Chin, Cheng and Tan, the Korean surname Jin, as well as the Vietnamese surname Tr\u1ea7n are often all the same exact character \u9673. The common Korean surname Kim is also the common Chinese surname Jin, and written \u91d1. The common Mandarin surnames Lin or Lim (\u6797) is also one and the same as the common Cantonese or Vietnamese surname ''Lam'' and Korean family name Lim ([[Korean phonology|written/pronounced as Im in South Korea]]). There are people with the surname of Hayashi (\u6797) in Japan too. The common Chinese surname \u674e, translated to English as Lee, is, in Chinese, the same character but transliterated as Li according to [[pinyin]] convention. Lee is also a common surname of Koreans, and the character is identical.\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{Main article|Vietnamese name}}\n40% of all [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] have the surname [[Nguyen]]. This may be because when a new dynasty took power in Vietnam it was custom to adopt that dynasty's surname. The last dynasty in Vietnam was the [[Nguyen dynasty]], so as a result, many people have this surname.\n\n== Africa ==\n\n===East Africa===\nIn several [[Northeast Bantu languages]] such as [[Kamba language|Kamba]], [[Taita language|Taita]] and [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]] in [[Kenya]] the word \"wa\" (meaning \"of\") is inserted before the surname, for instance, Mugo wa Kibiru ([[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]) and Mekatilili wa Menza ([[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]]).\n\n===Burundi and Rwanda===\nIn [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], most, if not all surnames have God in it, for example, Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (I thank God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth). But not all surnames end with the suffix -imana. Irakoze is one of these (technically meaning Thank God, though it is hard to translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.\n\n=== Ethiopia and Eritrea ===\n{{Main article|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}\n\nThe patronymic custom in most of the [[Horn of Africa]] gives children the father's first name as their surname. The family then gives the child its first name. Middle names are unknown. So, for example, a person's name might be ''Bereket Mekonen ''. In this case, ''Bereket '' is the first name and ''Mekonen'' is the surname, and also the first name of the father.\n\nThe paternal grandfather's name is often used if there is a requirement to identify a person further, for example, in school registration. Also, different cultures and tribes use the father's or grandfather's given name as the family's name. For example, some Oromos use Warra Ali to mean families of Ali, where Ali, is either the householder, a father or grandfather.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the customs surrounding the bestowal and use of family names is as varied and complex as the cultures to be found there. There are so many cultures, nations or tribes, that currently there can be no one formula whereby to demonstrate a clear pattern of Ethiopian family names. In general, however, Ethiopians use their father's name as a surname in most instances where identification is necessary, sometimes employing both father's and grandfather's names together where exigency dictates.\n\nMany people in Eritrea have Italian surnames, but all of these are owned by [[Italian Eritreans|Eritreans of Italian descent]].\n\n==Other countries==\n\n===Albania===\nA full Albanian name consists of a given name ({{lang-sq|em\u00ebr}}), patronymic ({{lang-sq|at\u00ebsi}}) and family name ({{lang-sq|mbiem\u00ebr}}), for example ''Agron Mark Gjoni''. The patronymic is simply the given name of the individual's father, with no suffix added. The family name is typically a noun in the definite form or at the very least ends with a vowel or -j (an approximant close to -i). Many traditional last names end with -aj (previously -anj), which is more prevalent in certain regions of Albania and Kosovo. For clarification, the \u201cfamily name\u201d is typically the father\u2019s fathers name (grandfather).{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nProper names in Albanian are fully declinable like any noun (e.g. ''Marinelda'', genitive case ''i/e Marineld\u00ebs'' \"of Marinelda\").\n\n===Armenia===\n[[Armenian surnames]] almost always have the ending ({{lang-hy|\u0575\u0561\u0576}}) transliterated into English as -yan or -ian (spelled -ean (\u0565\u0561\u0576) in Western Armenian and pre-Soviet Eastern Armenian, of Ancient [[Armenia]]n or [[Iran]]ian origin, presumably meaning \"son of\"), though names with that ending can also be found among Persians and a few other nationalities. Armenian surnames can derive from a geographic location, profession, noble rank, personal characteristic or personal name of an ancestor. Armenians in the diaspora sometimes adapt their surnames to help assimilation. In Russia, many have changed -yan to -ov (or -ova for women). In Turkey, many have changed the ending to -o\u011flu (also meaning \"son of\"). In English and French-speaking countries, many have shortened their name by removing the ending (for example [[Charles Aznavour]]). In ancient Armenia, many noble names ended with the locative -t'si (example, [[Moses of Chorene|Khorenatsi]]) or -uni ([[Bagratuni (disambiguation)|Bagratuni]]). Several modern Armenian names also have a Turkish suffix which appears before -ian/-yan: -lian denotes a placename; -djian denotes a profession. Some Western Armenian names have a particle Der, while their Eastern counterparts have Ter. This particle indicates an ancestor who was a priest (Armenian priests can choose to marry or remain celibate, but married priests cannot become a bishop). Thus someone named Der Bedrosian (Western) or Ter Petrosian (Eastern) is a descendant of an Armenian priest. The convention is still in use today: the children of a priest named Hagop Sarkisian would be called Der Sarkisian. Other examples of Armenian surnames: Adonts, Sakunts, Vardanyants, Rshtuni.\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nTraditional Azeri surnames usually end with \"-l\u0131\", \"-lu\", (Turkic for 'with' or 'belonging to'), \"-o\u011flu\", \"-q\u0131z\u0131\" (Turkic for 'son of' and 'daughter of'), \"-zade\" (Persian for 'born of'). Azerbaijanis of Iranian descent traditionally use suffixes such as '-pour' or '-zadeh', meaning 'born of' with their father's name. It is, however, more usual for them to use the name of the city in which their ancestors lived (e.g. Tabrizpour for those from Tabriz) or their occupation (e.g. Damirchizadeh for blacksmiths). Also, due to it being a part of the Russian Empire, many last names carry Slavic endings of \"-ov\" for men and \"-ova\" for women. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Georgia===\n{{Main article|List of Georgian surnames}}\n\nMost eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] surnames end with the suffix of \"-shvili\", (e.g. Kartveli'shvili) Georgian for \"child\" or \"offspring\". Western Georgian surnames most commonly have the suffix \"-dze\", (e.g. [[:ka:\u10da\u10d0\u10d1\u10d0\u10eb\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8|Laba'dze]]) Georgian for \"son\". [[Megrelian]] surnames usually end in \"-ia\", \"-ua\" or \"-ava\". Other location-specific endings exist: In [[Svaneti]] \"-iani\", meaning \"belonging to\", or \"hailing from\", is common. In the eastern Georgian highlands common endings are \"uri\" and \"uli\". Some noble family names end in \"eli\", meaning \"of (someplace)\".\nIn [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the surname is not normally used as the polite form of address; instead, the given name is used together with a title. For instance, Nikoloz Kartvelishvili is politely addressed as ''bat'ono Nikoloz'' \"My Lord. Nikoloz\".\n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n{{Main article|Greeks#Surnames}}\n\nGreek surnames are most commonly patronymics. Occupation, characteristic, or ethnic background and location/origin-based surnames names also occur; they are sometimes supplemented by nicknames.\n\nCommonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine [[proper nouns]] in the [[nominative case]]. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the [[genitive case]] of this proper noun for patronymic reasons.\n\nAlthough surnames are static today, dynamic and changing patronym usage survives in middle names in Greece where the genitive of the father's first name is commonly the middle name.\n\nBecause of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have [[Katharevousa]] forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris, and former vernacular practice (prefixing the surname to the proper name) was to call John Eleutherios '''Leftero-giannis'''.\n\nModern practice is to call the same person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive. However, children are almost always baptised with the archaic form of the name so in official matters, the child will be referred to as Ioannis Eleftheriou and not Giannis Eleftheriou.\n\nFemale surnames are most often in the Katharevousa genitive case of a male name. This is an innovation of the Modern Greek state; Byzantine practice was to form a feminine counterpart of the male surname (e.g. masculine Palaiologos, Byzantine feminine Palaiologina, Modern feminine Palaiologou).\n\nIn the past, women would change their surname when married to that of their husband (again in the genitive case) signifying the transfer of \"dependence\" from the father to the husband. In earlier Modern Greek society, women were named with '''''-aina''''' as a feminine suffix on the husband's first name: \"Giorgaina\", \"Mrs George\", \"Wife of George\". Nowadays, a woman's legal surname does not change upon marriage, though she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though in rare cases, if the bride and groom have agreed before the marriage, the children can receive the maternal surname.\n\nSome surnames are prefixed with '''''Papa-''''', indicating ancestry from a priest, e.g. ''Papageorgiou'', the \"son of a priest named George\". Others, like '''''Archi-''''' and '''''Mastro-''''' signify \"boss\" and \"[[tradesman]]\" respectively.\n\nPrefixes such as '''''Konto-''''', '''''Makro-''''', and '''''Chondro-''''' describe body characteristics, such as \"short\", \"tall/long\" and \"fat\". ''Gero-'' and ''Palaio-'' signify \"old\" or \"wise\".\n\nOther prefixes include '''''[[hajji|Hadji]]-''''' (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ae- or \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9-) which was an honorific deriving from the Arabic [[Hadj]] or pilgrimage, and indicate that the person had made a pilgrimage (in the case of Christians, to Jerusalem) and '''''Kara-''''' which is attributed to the Turkish word for \"black\" deriving from the [[Ottoman Empire]] era. The Turkish suffix '''''-oglou''''' (derived from a patronym, ''-o\u011flu'' in Turkish) can also be found. Although they are of course more common among Greece's Muslim minority, they still can be found among the Christian majority, often Greeks or [[Karamanlides]] who were pressured to leave Turkey after the Turkish Republic was founded (since Turkish surnames only date to the founding of the Republic, when Atat\u00fcrk made them compulsory).\n\n[[Arvanitic]] surnames also exist; an example is ''Tzanavaras'' or ''Tzavaras'', from the Arvanitic word ''\u00e7anavar'' or ''\u00e7avar'' meaning \"brave\" (''pallikari'' in Greek).<ref>Tzavaras, Ath.: \"Agapite Aderfe Vasileie\", Ekdosis Exantas, Athens 1999</ref>\n\nMost Greek patronymic suffixes are diminutives, which vary by region. The most common Hellenic patronymic suffixes are:\n* '''''-poulos/-poulou''''', which has a Latin origin (''pullus'') and means \"the little\", representing \"the son of ...\", so if a man's family name is \"Christopoulos\", it means that his father was named \"Christos\". This suffix is very widespread throughout Greece and is originally from the [[Peloponessus]] in particular.\n* '''''-idis/iadis/antis''''' The suffix '''''-idis''''' (often transliterated ''-ides'' in English and French) is the oldest in use. [[Zeus]], for example, was also referred to as ''[[Cronides]]'' (\"son of [[Cronus]]\"). A common suffix in Byzantium around [[Bithynia]] and [[Byzantine Thrace]] (Constantinople), also used by [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] in the [[Pontic Alps]], northeast [[Anatolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the former [[Russian Caucasus]] region of [[Kars Oblast]] e.g. ''Mikhailidis'', the \"clan of Michael\"\n* '''''-akis/-aki''''' is associated primarily with [[Crete]] and the [[Aegean Islands]]. It is a patronymic signifying \"little\" and/or \"son\"; therefore ''Theodorakis'' is \"little Theodore\".\n\nOthers, less common, are:\n* '''''-atos/-atou''''' (from [[Cephallonia]] and other [[Ionian Islands]])\n* '''''-as/-a/-ekas/kas''''' (from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]) and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]\n* '''''-ellis/-elli''''' (from [[Lesbos Island|Lesvos Island]])\n* '''''-eas/akos/oggonas''''' (from [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]])\n* '''''-oglou''''' (from the Turkish suffix for \"child of\" used by both genders)\n* '''''-ou''''' (genitive, from [[Cyprus]])\n* '''''-ou/ides/kos''''' (from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]])\n* '''''-ekas/las''''' (from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]])\n\nEither the surname or the given name may come first in different contexts; in newspapers and in informal uses, the order is ''given name + surname'', while in official documents and forums (tax forms, registrations, military service, school forms), the surname is often listed or said first.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{further|Hungarian name|Hungarian language#Name order}}\n\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], like Asian languages but unlike most other European ones (see French and German above for exceptions), the family name is placed before the given names. This usage does not apply to non-Hungarian names, for example \"Tony Blair\" will remain \"Tony Blair\" when written in Hungarian texts.\n\nNames of Hungarian individuals, however, appear in Western order in English writing.\n\n===Indonesia===\nIndonesians comprise more than 300 ethnic groups. Not all of these groups traditionally have surnames, and in the populous [[Java]] surnames are not common at all \u2013 regardless of which one of the [[Religion in Indonesia|six officially recognized religions]] the name carrier profess. For instance, a Christian Javanese woman named ''Agnes Mega Rosalin'' has three forenames and no surname. \"Agnes\" is her Christian name, but \"Mega\" can be the first name she uses and the name which she is addressed with. \"Rosalin\" is only a middle name. Nonetheless, Indonesians are well aware of the custom of family names, which is known as ''marga'' or ''fam'', and such names have become a specific kind of identifier. People can tell what a person's heritage is by his or her family or clan name.\n* The various ethnicities of [[Batak people]] from North Sumatra are known for their strict tradition of preserving their family names, which are actually clan names. See [[Marga (Batak)]] for details.\n* The [[matrilineal]] clan names of the [[Minangkabau people]] are passed down from mothers to their children. Minangkabau is the largest matrilineal society in the world.\n* The [[Minahasan]] people of North Sulawesi have an extensive list of surnames, such as ''Toar, Lumimuut, Emor, Muntuan, Nayoan, Wenas'' and ''Luntungan''.\n* The [[Ambonese]] people of the Maluku Islands have family names such as ''Lawalata, Matulessy'' and ''Latumahina''.\n* The various ethnicities of [[Dayak people]] from the provinces in [[Kalimantan]] have surnames such as ''Dau'' and ''Narang''.\n* The [[Bugis]] people from South Sulawesi have surnames such as ''Mappanyukki, Mallarangeng'' and ''Matalatta''.\n* Among the [[Toraja]] people of South Sulawesi, common surname elements include ''Rante\u2013, Pong\u2013, Allo\u2013, \u2013bua, \u2013linggi''. Examples: ''Rantedatu, Ranteallo, Pongrambu, Pongtiku, Pongrangga, Allodatu, Randebua, Tanabua, Tarukbua, Datubua, Allobua, Senolinggi''.\n\n[[Java (island)|Javanese]] people are the majority in Indonesia, and most do not have any surname. There are some individuals, especially the old generation, who have only one name, such as \"[[Suharto]]\" and \"[[Sukarno]]\". These are not only common with the Javanese but also with other Indonesian ethnic groups who do not have the tradition of surnames. If, however, they are Muslims, they might opt to follow [[Arabic name|Arabic naming]] customs, but Indonesian Muslims don't automatically follow Arabic name traditions.\n\nIn conjunction with migration to Europe or America, Indonesians without surnames often adopt a surname based on some family name or middle name. The forms for [[Visa (document)|visa]] application many Western countries use, has a square for writing the last name which cannot be left unfilled by the applicant.\n\nMost [[Chinese Indonesian]]s substituted their Chinese surnames with Indonesian-sounding surnames due to political pressure from 1965 to 1998 under Suharto's regime.\n\n===Iranian/Persian/Kazan===<!-- Other pages link here, so please don't change the heading unless you also check and update them -->\nPersian last names may be:\n* Simple nouns; e.g. Afshar (\"Of [[Afsharid dynasty]]\"), [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Bahar]], [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m|Khayyam]]\n* Noun plus a suffix; e.g. Golzaar (Gol + -zaar), Amouzgaar (Amouz + -gaar), [[Khosrau I|Daadgar]] (Daad + -gar)\n* More complex compound nouns; e.g. Bolurforushan (Bolur + forush + -an), [[Ahmedinejad]] (Ahmed + -i + -nejad), [[Farshchian]] (Farsh + -chi + -an)\n* Two or more nouns; e.g. [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Hashemi Rafsanjani]]\n\nSuffixes include: -an (plural suffix), -i (\"of\"), -zad/-zadeh (\"born of\"), -pur (\"son of\"), -nejad (\"from the race of\"), -nia (\"descendant of\"), -mand (\"having or pertaining to\"), -vand (\"succeeding\"), -far (\"holder of\"), -doost (\"[[:wiktionary:-phile#English|-phile]]\"), -khah (\"seeking of\"), -manesh (\"having the manner of\"), -ian/-yan, -gar and -chi (\"whose vocation pertains\").\n\nAn example is names of geographical locations plus \"-i\": Irani (\"Iranian\"), Gilani (\"of [[Gilan]] province\"), Tabrizi (\"of the city of [[Tabriz]]\").\n\nAnother example is last names that indicate relation to religious groups such as [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrian]] (e.g. Goshtaspi, Namiranian, Azargoshasp), [[Persian Jews|Jewish]] (e.g. Yaghubian [Jacobean], Hayyem [Life], Shaul [Saul]) or [[Muslim]] (e.g. Alavi, Islamnia, [[Montazeri]])\n\nLast names are arbitrary; their holder need not to have any relation with their meaning.\n\nTraditionally in Iran, the wife does not take her husband's surname, although children take the surname of their father. Individual reactions notwithstanding, it is possible to call a married woman by her husband's surname. This is facilitated by the fact that English words \"Mrs.\", \"Miss\", \"Woman\", \"Lady\" and \"Wife (of)\" in a polite context are all translated into \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645\" (Khaanom). Context, however, is important: \"\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u06af\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\" (Khaanom Goldust) may, for instance, refer to the daughter of Mr. Goldust instead of his wife.\nWhen most of Iranian surnames are used with a name, the name will be ended with a suffix _E or _ie (of) such as Hasan_e roshan (Hasan is name and roshan is surname) that means Hasan of Roshan or Mosa_ie saiidi (Muses of saiidi). The _e is not for surname and it is difficult to say it is a part of surname.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main article|Italian surname}}\n\nItaly has around 350,000 surnames. Most of them derive from the following sources: [[patronym]] or [[wikt:ilk|ilk]] (e.g. ''Francesco di Marco'', \"Francis, son of Mark\" or ''[[Eduardo de Filippo]]'', \"Edward belonging to the family of Philip\"), occupation (e.g. ''[[Enzo Ferrari]]'', \"Heinz (of the) Blacksmiths\"), personal characteristic (e.g. nicknames or pet names like ''Dario Forte'', \"Darius the Strong\"), geographic origin (e.g. ''Elisabetta Romano'', \"Elisabeth from Rome\") and objects (e.g. ''Carlo Sacchi'', \"Charles Bags\"). The two most common Italian family names, ''Russo'' and ''Rossi'', mean the same thing, \"Red\", possibly referring to the hair color.\n\nBoth Western and Eastern orders are used for full names: the given name usually comes first, but the family name may come first in administrative settings; lists are usually indexed according to the last name.\n\nSince 1975, women have kept their own surname when married, but until recently (2000){{dubious|reason=No given reference to such a reform. The relevant rule, article 143 bis of Italian Civil Code, stays unchanged since 1975.|date=November 2013}} they could have added the surname of the husband according to the civil code, although it was a very seldom-used practice. In recent years, the husband's surname cannot be used in any official situation.{{dubious|reason=No given reference to such a reform. The relevant rule, article 143 bis of Italian Civil Code, stays unchanged since 1975.|date=November 2013}}<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.jus.unitn.it/cardozo/Obiter_Dictum/codciv/Lib1.htm Italian Civil Code, art. 143 bis]</ref> In some unofficial situations, sometimes both surnames are written (the proper first), sometimes separated by ''in'' (e.g. ''Giuseppina Mauri in Crivelli'') or, in case of widows, ''ved.'' (''vedova'').\n\n===Latvia===\n{{Main article|Latvian name}}\n\nLatvian male surnames usually end in ''-s'', ''-\u0161'' or ''-is'' whereas the female versions of the same names end in ''-a'' or ''-e'' or ''s'' in both unmarried and married women.\n\nBefore the emancipation from serfdom (1817 in [[Courland]], 1819 in [[Vidzeme]], 1861 in [[Latgale]]) only noblemen, free craftsmen or people living in towns had surnames. Therefore, the oldest Latvian surnames originate from German or Low German, reflecting the dominance of German as an official language in Latvia till the 19th century. Examples: ''Meijers/Meijere'' (German: ''Meier'', farm administrator; akin to Mayor), ''Millers/Millere'' (German: ''M\u00fcller'', miller), ''\u0160mits/\u0160mite'' (German: ''Schmidt'', smith), ''\u0160ulcs/\u0160ulca'' (German: ''Schulze'', constable), ''Ulmanis'' (German: ''Ullmann'', a person from [[Ulm]]), ''Godmanis'' (a God-man), ''P\u0113tersons'' (son of Peter). Some Latvian surnames, mainly from Latgale are of Polish or Belorussian origin by changing the final ''-ski/-cki'' to ''-skis/-ckis'', ''-czyk'' to ''-\u010diks'' or ''-vich/-wicz'' to ''-vi\u010ds'', such as ''Sokolovkis/Sokolovska'', ''Baldun\u010diks/Baldun\u010dika'' or ''Ratkevi\u010ds/Ratkevi\u010da''.\n\nMost Latvian peasants received their surnames in 1826 (in [[Vidzeme]]), in 1835 (in [[Courland]]), and in 1866 (in [[Latgale]]). Diminutives were the most common form of family names. Examples: ''Kalni\u0146\u0161/Kalni\u0146a'' (small hill), ''B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161/B\u0113rzi\u0146a'' (small birch).\n\nNowadays many Latvians of Slavic descent have surnames of Russian, Belarusian, or Ukrainian origin, for example ''Volkovs/Volkova'' or ''Anto\u0146enko''.\n\n===Libya===\nLibya's names and surnames have a strong Islamic/Arab nature, with some Turkish influence from Ottoman Empire rule of nearly 400 years.\nAmazigh, Touareg and other minorities also have their own name/surname traditions.\nDue to its location as a trade route and the different cultures that had their impact on Libya throughout history, one can find names that could have originated in neighboring countries, including clan names from the Arabian Peninsula, and Turkish names derived from military rank or status (''Basha'', ''Agha'').\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{Main article|Lithuanian name}}\n\nLithuanian names follow the Baltic distinction between male and female suffixes of names, although the details are different. Male surnames usually end in ''-a'', ''-as'', ''-aitis'', ''-ys'', ''-ius'', or ''-us'', whereas the female versions change these suffixes to ''-ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117'', and ''-ut\u0117'' respectively (if unmarried), ''-ien\u0117'' (if married), or ''-\u0117'' (not indicating the marital status). Some Lithuanians have names of Polish or another Slavic origin, which are made to conform to Lithuanian by changing the final ''-ski'' to ''-skas'', such as ''Sadauskas'', with the female version bein -''skait\u0117'' (if unmarried), ''-skien\u0117'' (if married), or ''-sk\u0117'' (not indicating the marital status).\n\n===Malta===\nDifferent cultures have their impact on the demographics of the Maltese islands, and this is evident in the various surnames Maltese citizens bear nowadays.<ref>http://en.geneanum.com/malta/documents/genealogy/maltese-surnames.html</ref> There are very few ''Maltese'' surnames per se: the few that originate from Maltese places of origin include ''Chircop'' ([[Kirkop]]), ''Lia'' ([[Lija]]), ''Balzan'' ([[Balzan]]), ''Valletta'' ([[Valletta]]), and ''Sciberras'' (Xebb ir-Ras Hill, on which Valletta was built). The village of [[Munxar]], [[Gozo]] is characterised by the majority of its population having one of two surnames, either ''Curmi'' or ''de Brincat''. In Gozo, the surnames ''Bajada'' and ''Farrugia'' are also common.\n* '''[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and Italian surnames'''\nSicilian and Italian surnames are common due to the close vicinity to Malta. Sicilian Italians were the first to colonise the Maltese islands. Common examples include ''Azzopardi'', ''Bonello'', ''Cauchi'', ''[[Farrugia]]'', ''[[Gauci]]'', ''Rizzo'', ''[[Schembri]]'', ''Tabone'', ''Vassallo'', ''Vella''.\n* '''French surnames'''\nCommon examples include ''Depuis'', ''Montfort'', ''Monsenuier'', ''Tafel''.\n* '''English surnames'''\nEnglish surnames exist for a number of reasons, but mainly due to migration as well as Malta forming a part of the British Empire in the 19th century and most of the 20th. Common examples include ''Bone'', ''Harding'', ''Atkins'', ''Mattocks'', ''Smith'', ''Jones'', ''Woods'', ''Turner''.\n* '''[[Siculo-Arabic|Sicilian Arabic]] surnames'''\nArabic surnames occur in part due to the early presence of the Arabs in Malta. Common examples include ''Sammut'', ''Camilleri'', ''Zammit'', and ''Xuereb''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cassar |first=Mario |url=https://ema-ps.academia.edu/MarioCassar/Papers/99102/Vestiges_of_Arabic_Nomencalture_in_Maltese_Surnames |title=Vestiges of Arabic Nomenclature in Maltese Surnames &#124; Mario Cassar{{Snd}} Academia.edu |publisher=Ema-ps.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n* '''Spanish surnames'''\nCommon surnames of Spanish origin include ''Abela'', ''Galdes'', ''Herrera'', and ''Guzman''.\n* '''German surnames'''\nSurnames from foreign countries from the Middle Ages include German,<br />\nsuch as ''von Brockdorff'', ''Hyzler'', and ''Schranz''.\n* '''Greek surnames'''\nMany of the earliest Maltese surnames are Sicilian Greek, e.g. ''Cilia'', ''Calleia'', ''Brincat'', ''Cauchi''. Much less common are recent surnames from Greece; examples include ''Dacoutros'', and ''Trakosopoulos''\n* '''Jewish surnames'''\nThe original Jewish community of Malta and Gozo has left no trace of their presence on the islands since they were expelled in January 1493.\n* '''Customs'''\nIn line with the practice in other Christian, European states, women generally assume their husband's surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear. Some women opt to retain their old name, for professional/personal reasons, or combine their surname with that of their husband.\n\n===Mongolia===\n{{Main article|Mongolian name}}\n\nMongolians do not use surnames in the way that most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics \u2013 then called ''ovog'', now called ''etsgiin ner'' \u2013 are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in [[genitive]] case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial \u2013 Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj ''guai'' \u2013 Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are usually just kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.\n\nSince 2000, Mongolians have been officially using [[List of medieval Mongolian tribes and clans|clan names]] \u2013 ''ovog'', the same word that had been used for the patronymics before \u2013 on their IDs. Many people chose the names of the ancient clans and tribes such [[Borjigin]], Besud, [[Jalair]], etc. Also many extended families chose the names of the native places of their ancestors. Some chose the names of their most ancient known ancestor. Some just decided to pass their own given names (or modifications of their given names) to their descendants as clan names. Some chose other attributes of their lives as surnames. [[J\u00fcgderdemidiin G\u00fcrragchaa|G\u00fcrragchaa]] chose Sansar (Cosmos). Clan names precede the patronymics and given names, e.g. Besud Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.<ref>[http://www.mongoleiservice.de/mongolei__gesellschaft/mongolei__gesellschaft.html Hans Peter Vietze: Mongolische Namen (in German)]</ref> These clan names have a significance and are included in Mongolian passports.\n\n===Myanmar (Burma)===\n{{Main article|Burmese name}}\n\nPeople from Myanmar or Burmese, have no family names. This, to some, is the only known Asian people having no family names at all. Some of those from Myanmar or Burma, who are familiar with European or American cultures, began to put to their younger generations with a family name \u2013 adopted from the notable ancestors. For example, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the late Father of Independence General Aung San; [[Hayma Ne Win]], is the daughter of the famous actor [[Kawleikgyin Ne Win]] etc.\n\n===The Philippines===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main article|Filipino name}}\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, there was no standardization of surnames in the [[Philippines]]. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, as well as those who took certain surnames simply because they had a certain prestige, usually ones related to the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] religion, such as [[de los Santos]] (\"of the saints\") and [[Delacruz|de la Cruz]] (\"of the cross\").\n\nOn 21 November 1849, the Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa]], decreed an end to these arbitrary practices, the systematic distribution of surnames to Filipinos without prior surnames and the universal implementation of the Spanish naming system. This produced the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' (\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\"), which listed permitted surnames with origins in Spanish, Filipino, and Hispanicised Chinese words, names, and numbers. Thus, many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the rest of the Hispanophone world. Surnames with connections to nobility, either Spanish or local, however, was explicitly prohibited, and only allowed to be retained by families with noble status or having the surname used in three consecutive generations. The book contained many words coming from Spanish and the Philippine languages such as Tagalog, as well as many [[Basque surnames]] such as Zuloaga or Aguirre.\n\nThe colonial authorities implemented this decree because too many (early) Christianized Filipinos assumed religious names. There soon were too many people surnamed \"de los Santos\" (\"of the saints\"), \"de la Cruz\" (\"of the cross\"), \"[[del Rosario]]\" (\"of the Rosary\"), \"[[Bautista]]\" (\"Baptist\"), et cetera, which made it difficult for the Spanish colonists to control the Filipino people, and most importantly, to collect taxes. These extremely common names were also banned by the decree unless the name has been used by a family for at least four generations. This Spanish naming custom also countered the native custom before the Spanish period, wherein siblings assumed different surnames. Claver\u00eda's decree was enforced to different degrees in different parts of the colony.\n\nBecause of this implementation of [[Spanish naming customs]], of the arrangement \"given_name + paternal_surname + maternal_surname\", in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.\n\nIn practice, the application of this decree varied from municipality to municipality. Most municipalities received surnames starting with only one initial letter, but some are assigned surnames starting with two or three initial letters. For example, the majority of residents of the island of [[Banton, Romblon|Banton]] in the province of Romblon have surnames starting with F such as ''Fabicon'', ''Fallarme'', ''Fadrilan'', and ''Ferran''. Other examples are case of Batangas, Batangas (present-day [[Batangas City]]), where most residents bear surnames starting with the letters A, B, and C, such as ''Abacan'', ''Albayalde'', ''Almarez'', ''Andal'', ''Arce'', ''Arceo'', ''Arguelles'', ''Arrieta'', ''Babasa'', ''Balmes'', ''Basco'', ''Baylosis'', ''Berberabe'', ''Biscocho'', ''Blanco'', ''Borbon'', ''Calingasan'', ''Caringal'', ''Chavez'', ''Cuenca'', and ''Custodio'' (in addition to some bearing native Tagalog surnames, such as ''Dimaano'', ''Dimacuha'', ''Macatangay'', ''Malabanan'', and ''Marasigan''), and [[Argao, Cebu|Argao]], [[Cebu]], where most residents bear surnames starting with ''VI'' and ''Al'', such as ''Villaluz'', ''Villaflor'', ''Villamor'', ''Villanueva'', ''Albo'', ''Alcain'', ''Alcarez'', ''Algones'', etc.\n\nThus, although perhaps a majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry. In addition, most Filipinos currently do not use Spanish accented letters in their Spanish derived names. The lack of accents in Filipino Spanish has been attributed to the lack of accents on the predominantly American typewriters after the US gained control of the Philippines.\n\nThe vast majority of Filipinos follow a naming system in the American order (i.e. given_name + middle_name + surname), which is the reverse of the Spanish naming order (i.e. given_name + paternal_surname + maternal_surname). Children take the mother's surname as their [[middle name]], followed by their father's as their surname; for example, a son of Juan de la Cruz and his wife Mar\u00eda Agbayani may be David Agbayani de la Cruz. Women usually take the surnames of their husband upon marriage, and consequently lose their maiden middle names; so upon her marriage to David de la Cruz, the full name of Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg would become Laura Macaraeg de la Cruz. Their maiden last names automatically become their middle names upon marriage.\n\nThere are other sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, which in some cases could indicate Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanicised Chinese numerals and other Hispanicised Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the ''Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos''. For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanicised Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor's surname as well as the name of that ancestor's godparent on receiving Christian baptism.\n\nIn the predominantly [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] areas of the southern Philippines, adoption of surnames was influenced by Islamic religious terms. As a result, surnames among Filipino Muslims are largely Arabic-based, and include such surnames as [[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]] and Haradji.\n\nThere are also Filipinos who, to this day, have no surnames at all, particularly if they come from indigenous cultural communities.\n\n====Naming customs in the Philippines====\nPrior to the establishment of the Philippines as a US territory during the earlier part of the 20th century, Filipinos usually followed Iberian naming customs. However, upon the promulgation of the Family Code of 1987, Filipinos formalized adopting the American system of using their surnames.\n\nA common Filipino name will consist of the given name (mostly 2 given names are given), the initial letter of the mother's maiden name and finally the father's surname (i.e. Lucy Anne C. de Guzman). Also, women are allowed to retain their maiden name or use both her and her husband's surname as a [[double-barreled surname]], separated by a dash. This is common in feminist circles or when the woman holds a prominent office (e.g. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]]). In more traditional circles, especially those who belong to the prominent families in the provinces, the custom of the woman being addressed as \"Mrs. Husband's Full Name\" is still common.\n\nFor widows, who chose to marry again, two norms are in existence. For those who were widowed before the Family Code, the full name of the woman remains while the surname of the deceased husband is attached. That is, Maria Andres, who was widowed by Ignacio Dimaculangan will have the name Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan. If she chooses to marry again, this name will still continue to exist while the surname of the new husband is attached. Thus, if Maria marries Rene de los Santos, her new name will be Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos.\n\nHowever, a new norm is also in existence. The woman may choose to use her husband's surname to be one of her middle names. Thus, Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos may also be called Maria A.D. de los Santos.\n\nChildren will however automatically inherit their father's surname if they are considered legitimate. If the child is born out of wedlock, the mother will automatically pass her surname to the child, unless the father gives a written acknowledgment of paternity. The father may also choose to give the child both his parents' surnames if he wishes (that is Gustavo Paredes, whose parents are Eulogio Paredes and Juliana Angeles, while having Maria Solis as a wife, may name his child Kevin S. Angeles-Paredes.\n\nIn some Tagalog regions, the norm of giving patronyms, or in some cases matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of course not official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited. It is not uncommon to refer to someone as Juan anak ni Pablo (John, the son of Paul) or Juan apo ni Teofilo (John, the grandson of Theophilus).\n\n===Romania===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n{{main article|Romanian names}}\nIn [[Romania]], like in most of Europe, it is customary for a child to take his father's family name, and a wife to take her husband's last name. However, this is not compulsory{{Snd}} spouses and parents are allowed to choose other options too, as the law is flexible (see Art. 282,<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-282-alegerea-numelui-de-familie-formalitatile-pentru-incheierea-casatoriei-incheierea-casatoriei</ref> Art. 449<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-449-numele-copilului-din-casatorie-situatia-legala-a-copilului-filiatia</ref> Art. 450.<ref>http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-civil/art-450-numele-copilului-din-afara-casatoriei-situatia-legala-a-copilului-filiatia</ref> of the [[Civil Code of Romania]]).\n\nUntil the 19th century, the names were primarily of the form \"[given name] [father's name] [grandfather's name]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/seesscm/romanian-personal-names|title=Romanian Personal Names|last=|first=|date=15 October 2015|website=Slavic Cataloging Manual|access-date=}}</ref> The few exceptions are usually famous people or the nobility (boyars). The name reform introduced around 1850 had the names changed to a western style, most likely imported from France, consisting of a given name followed by a family name.\n\nAs such, the name is called ''prenume'' (French ''pr\u00e9nom''), while the family name is called ''nume'' or, when otherwise ambiguous, ''nume de familie'' (\"family name\"). Although not mandatory, middle names are common.\n\nHistorically, when the family name reform was introduced in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a [[matronym]] when the father was dead or unknown. A common convention was to append the suffix ''-escu'' to the father's name, e.g. ''Anghelescu'' (\"''Anghel's'' child\") and ''Petrescu'' (\"''Petre's'' child\"). (The ''-escu'' seems to come from Latin ''-iscum'', thus being cognate with Italian ''-esco'' and French ''-esque''.) Another common convention was to append the suffix ''-eanu'' to the name of the place of origin, e.g. ''Munteanu'' (\"from the mountains\") and ''Moldoveanu'' (\"from ''Moldova''\"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.\n\nThere are also descriptive family names derived from occupations, nicknames, and events, e.g. ''Botezatu'' (\"baptised\"), ''Barbu'' (\"bushy bearded\"), ''Prodan'' (\"foster\"), ''B\u0103lan'' (\"blond\"), ''Fieraru'' (\"smith\"), ''Croitoru'' (\"tailor\"), \"[[P\u0103curaru]]\" (\"shepherd\").\n\nRomanian family names remain the same regardless of the sex of the person.\n\nAlthough given names appear before family names in most Romanian contexts, official documents invert the order, ostensibly for filing purposes. Correspondingly, Romanians occasionally introduce themselves with their family names first, e.g. a student signing a test paper in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbiic.gov/public/2008/nov/Naming_practice_guide_UK_2006.pdf|title=A Guide to Names and Naming Practices|last=United Kingdom|first=|date=March 2006|website=Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nRomanians bearing names of non-Romanian origin often adopt Romanianised versions of their ancestral surnames. For example, ''Jurovschi'' for Polish ''[[\u017burowski]]'', or [[Popovici]] for Serbian [[Popovi\u0107]] (\"son of a priest\"), which preserves the original pronunciation of the surname through transliteration. In some cases, these changes were mandated by the state.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{See also|Turkish name#Surnames}}\n\nIn Turkey, following the [[Surname Law]] imposed in 1934 in the context of [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms]], every family living in Turkey was given a family name. The surname was generally selected by the elderly people of the family and could be any [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word (or a permitted word for families belonging to official minority groups).\n\nSome of the most common family names in Turkey are ''[[Y\u0131lmaz]]'' ('undaunted'), ''[[Do\u011fan]]'' ('falcon'), ''[[\u015eahin]]'' ('hawk'), ''[[Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (disambiguation)|Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m]]'' ('thunderbolt'), ''[[\u015eim\u015fek]]'' ('lightning'), ''[[\u00d6zt\u00fcrk]]'' ('purely Turkish').\n\n[[Patronymic]] surnames do not necessarily refer to ancestry, or in most cases cannot be traced back historically. The most usual Turkish patronymic suffix is ''\u2013o\u011flu''; ''\u2013ov(a)'', ''\u2013yev(a)'' and ''\u2013zade'' also occur in the surnames of Azeri or other Turkic descendants.\n\nOfficial minorities like Armenians, Greeks, and Jews have surnames in their own mother languages.\nThe Armenian families living in Turkey usually have Armenian surnames and generally have the suffix ''\u2013yan'', ''\u2013ian'', or, using Turkish spelling, ''-can''. Greek descendants usually have Greek surnames which might have Greek suffixes like ''\u2013ou'', ''\u2013aki(s)'', ''\u2013poulos/poulou'', ''\u2013idis/idou'', ''\u2013iadis/iadou'' or prefixes like ''papa\u2013''.\nThe Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain and settled in Turkey in 1492 have both Jewish/Hebrew surnames, and Spanish surnames, usually indicating their native regions, cities or villages back in Spain, like ''De Leon'' or ''Toledano''.\n\nHowever these minorities increasingly tend to \"Turkicize\" their surnames or replace their original surnames with Turkish surnames altogether to avoid being recognized and discriminated against.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|Appendix:Names}}\n\n{{Personal names by culture}}\n{{Personal names}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family name}}\n[[Category:Family|Name]]\n[[Category:Surname]]\n[[Category:Surnames by culture| ]]\n", "name_user": "41.13.5.8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFrench-speaking countries)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surnames_by_country"}

Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref>{{cite journal|first=Glenn D.|last=Walters|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918|title=The Trouble with Psychopathy as a General Theory of Crime|journal=[[International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, California|volume=48|issue=2|date=April 2004|pages=133\u2013148|doi=10.1177/0306624X03259472|pmid=15070462|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119002546/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918 |archive-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nStudies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and [[violence]], and the PCL-R emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior.

Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated with Factor 1 of the [[Psychopathy Checklist|PCL-R]], which describes the emotional deficits and the [[Psychological manipulation|callous and exploitative]] interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a lack of close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional [[aggression]] and therefore may not be amenable to the types of [[psychosocial]] interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.<ref name=\"Walsh2010\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swogger|first1=Marc T.|last2=Walsh|first2=Zach|last3=Kosson|first3=David S.|title=Domestic violence and psychopathic traits: distinguishing the antisocial batterer from other antisocial offenders|journal=[[Aggressive Behavior (journal)|Aggressive Behavior]]|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|location=New York City|date=May 2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=253\u2013260|doi=10.1002/ab.20185|pmid=17444531}}</ref>\n\nSome clinicians suggest that assessment of the [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence [[risk assessment]].

In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores.

Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] referred to as \"life-course- persistent\" antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term antisocial behavior.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nIt has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and [[ADHD]] may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with psychopathy.

Blair, a researcher who pioneered research into psychopathic tendencies stated, \u201cWith regard to psychopathy, we have clear indications regarding why the pathology gives rise to the emotional and behavioral disturbance and important insights into the neural systems implicated in this pathology\u201d.<ref name=Blair2002 /> Dadds et al., remarks that despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known about the developmental underpinnings of the psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy.<ref name=\"Dadds et al.\">{{cite journal |title=Learning to 'talk the talk': the relationship of psychopathic traits to deficits in empathy across childhood |year=2010 |last=Dadds |first=Mark|journal=The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=50 |pages=599\u2013606 |issue=5 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02058.x|pmid=19445007 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nA 2008 review by Weber et al. suggested that psychopathy is sometimes associated with brain abnormalities in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]]-[[temporal lobe|temporo]]-[[limbic system|limbic]] regions that are involved in emotional and learning processes, among others.<ref name=\"review2008\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bsl.802 |title=Structural brain abnormalities in psychopaths\u2014a review |year=2008 |last1=Weber |first1=Sabrina |last2=Habel |first2=Ute |last3=Amunts |first3=Katrin |last4=Schneider |first4=Frank |journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law |volume=26 |pages=7\u201328 |pmid=18327824 |issue=1}}</ref> Neuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences between those scoring high and low on the PCL-R in a 2011 review by Skeem et al. stating that they are \"most notably in the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]] and [[parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyri]], anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]], [[striatum]], [[Insular cortex|insula]], and [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[cerebral cortex|cortex]]\".<ref name=\"gap\" /> A 2010 meta-analysis found that antisocial, violent and psychopathic individuals had reduced structure function in the right [[orbitofrontal cortex]], right [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 2784035|year = 2009|last1 = Yang|first1 = Y.|title = Prefrontal Structural and Functional Brain Imaging findings in Antisocial, Violent, and Psychopathic Individuals: A Meta-Analysis|journal = Psychiatry Research|volume = 174|issue = 2|pages = 81\u201388|last2 = Raine|first2 = A.|pmid = 19833485|doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.03.012}}</ref>\n\nThe amygdala and frontal areas have been suggested as particularly important.<ref name=\"pmid18434283\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0027 |title=The amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex: Functional contributions and dysfunction in psychopathy |year=2008 |last1=Blair |first1=R.J.R |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=363 |issue=1503 |pages=2557\u201365 |pmid=18434283 |pmc=2606709}}</ref> People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity between the [[white matter]] connecting the amygdala and [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (such as the uncinate fasciculus). The evidence suggested that the degree of abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors.<ref name=\"pmid19506560\"/> Furthermore, changes in the amygdala have been associated with \"callous-unemotional\" traits in children. However, the amygdala has also been associated with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas, which may be due to methodological issues.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nSome of these findings are consistent with other research and theories. For example, in a [[neuroimaging]] study of how individuals with psychopathy respond to emotional words, widespread differences in activation patterns have been shown across the temporal lobe when psychopathic criminals were compared to \"normal\" volunteers, which is consistent with views in clinical psychology. Additionally, the notion of psychopathy being characterized by low fear is consistent with findings of abnormalities in the amygdala, since deficits in aversive conditioning and instrumental learning are thought to result from amygdala dysfunction, potentially compounded by [[orbitofrontal cortex]] dysfunction, although the specific reasons are unknown.<ref name=Blair2002>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.182.1.5 |title=Neurobiological basis of psychopathy |year=2003 |last1=Blair |first1=R.

There is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n===Biochemical===\nHigh levels of [[testosterone]] combined with low levels of [[cortisol]] and/or [[serotonin]] have been theorized as contributing factors. Testosterone is \"associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction\", and injecting testosterone \"shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity\", decreases fearfulness, and increases \"responding to angry faces\". Some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior. High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with \"impulsive and highly negative reactions\", and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes frustrated.<ref name=Glenn2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2008.03.004 |title=The Neurobiology of Psychopathy |year=2008 |last1=Glenn |first1=Andrea L. |last2=Raine |first2=Adrian |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=463\u201375, vii |pmid=18638646}}</ref> Several animal studies note the role of [[serotonin|serotonergic]] functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579409000418 |title=Multifinality in the development of personality disorders: A Biology \u00d7 Sex \u00d7 Environment interaction model of antisocial and borderline traits |year=2009 |last1=Beauchaine |first1=Theodore P. |last2=Klein |first2=Daniel N. |last3=Crowell |first3=Sheila E. |last4=Derbidge |first4=Christina |last5=Gatzke-Kopp |first5=Lisa |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=735\u201370 |pmid=19583882 |pmc=2709751}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579405050546 |title=Developmental psychopathology and neurobiology of aggression |year=2005 |last1=Gollan |first1=Jackie K. |last2=Lee |first2=Royce |last3=Coccaro |first3=Emil F. |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=1151\u201371 |pmid=16613435}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Lee R, Coccaro ER |chapter=Neurobiology of impulsive aggression: Focus on serotonin and the orbitofrontal cortex |veditors=Flannery DJ, Vazsonyi AT, Waldman ID |title=The Cambridge handbook of violent behavior and aggression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |pages=170\u201386 |isbn=978-0-521-60785-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.149 |title=The evidence for a neurobiological model of childhood antisocial behavior |year=2007 |last1=Van Goozen |first1=Stephanie H.

It is a self-report scale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales.<ref name=\"ppi-r\">Lilienfeld S. O., Widows M. R. (2005).

Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.</ref> The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two.<ref name=\"gap\" /> Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n====DSM and ICD====\nThere are currently two widely established systems for classifying [[mental disorders]]\u2014the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD) produced by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). Both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general term that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an \"antisocial reaction\" and \"dyssocial reaction\". The latter two eventually became [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) in the DSM and [[dissocial personality disorder]] in the ICD.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a disorder officially titled as such.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref name=\"Handbook of Psychopathy\">{{cite book |last=Patrick |first=Christopher |title=Handbook of Psychopathy |year=2005 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-804-2}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"aspd statement\" />\n\n====Other tools====\nThere are some traditional [[personality tests]] that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior.

Men score higher than women on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar [[Factor analysis|factor structure]] for men and women.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nMany associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with [[openness to experience]] in women. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] pattern while in women it manifests more as a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women. On the other hand, psychopathy may have a stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion is that psychopathy manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nStudies have also found that women in prison score significantly lower on psychopathy than men, with one study reporting only 11 percent of violent females in prison met the psychopathy criteria in comparison to 31 percent of violent males.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Psychopathy in women: theoretical and clinical perspectives|journal = International Journal of Women's Health|date = 2012-06-01|issn = 1179-1411|pmc = 3379858|pmid = 22723733|pages = 257\u2013263|volume = 4|doi = 10.2147/IJWH.S25518|first = Rolf|last = Wynn|first2 = Marita H|last2 = H\u00f8iseth|first3 = Gunn|last3 = Pettersen}}</ref> Other studies have also pointed out that high psychopathic females are rare in forensic settings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = [Psychopathic personality in women.

Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref>{{cite journal|first=Glenn D.|last=Walters|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918|title=The Trouble with Psychopathy as a General Theory of Crime|journal=[[International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, California|volume=48|issue=2|date=April 2004|pages=133\u2013148|doi=10.1177/0306624X03259472|pmid=15070462|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119002546/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918 |archive-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nStudies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and [[violence]], and the PCL-R emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior.

Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated with Factor 1 of the [[Psychopathy Checklist|PCL-R]], which describes the emotional deficits and the [[Psychological manipulation|callous and exploitative]] interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a lack of close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional [[aggression]] and therefore may not be amenable to the types of [[psychosocial]] interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.<ref name=\"Walsh2010\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swogger|first1=Marc T.|last2=Walsh|first2=Zach|last3=Kosson|first3=David S.|title=Domestic violence and psychopathic traits: distinguishing the antisocial batterer from other antisocial offenders|journal=[[Aggressive Behavior (journal)|Aggressive Behavior]]|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|location=New York City|date=May 2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=253\u2013260|doi=10.1002/ab.20185|pmid=17444531}}</ref>\n\nSome clinicians suggest that assessment of the [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence [[risk assessment]].

In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1002/0470013397.ch5 |chapter=Violence Risk: From Prediction to Management |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jV79pP8rW8kC&pg=PA127 |title=Handbook of Psychology in Legal Contexts |year=2005 |last1=Heilbrun |first1=Kirk |isbn=978-0-470-01339-7 |pages=127\u201342 |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Carson |editor2-first=Ray |editor2-last=Bull}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills et. al\">{{cite book |first1=Jeremy F. |last1=Mills |first2=Daryl G. |last2=Kroner |first3=Robert D. |last3=Morgan |title=Clinician's Guide to Violence Risk Assessment |chapter=Psychopathic Traits |pages=55\u201364 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jw-Slr65eQC&pg=PA55 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |location=New York City|isbn=978-1-60623-985-8|date=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0020473 |title=The efficacy of violence prediction: A meta-analytic comparison of nine risk assessment tools |year=2010 |last1=Yang |first1=Min |last2=Wong |first2=Stephen C.

Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] referred to as \"life-course- persistent\" antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term antisocial behavior.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nIt has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and [[ADHD]] may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with psychopathy. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nThe [[DSM-5]] includes a specifier for those with conduct disorder who also display a [[callous and unemotional traits|callous, unemotional interpersonal style]] across multiple settings and relationships.<ref name=\":2\" /> The specifier is based on research which suggests that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for the specifier tend to have a more severe form of the disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment.

Since the 1980s, scientists have linked [[traumatic brain injury]], including damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such areas resembled \"psychopathic individuals\" whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] may also impair [[reinforcement|stimulus-reinforced learning]] in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their [[uncinate fasciculus]]\u2014[[white matter]] connecting the amygdala and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].

Testosterone is \"associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction\", and injecting testosterone \"shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity\", decreases fearfulness, and increases \"responding to angry faces\". Some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior.

It is a self-report scale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales.<ref name=\"ppi-r\">Lilienfeld S. O., Widows M. R. (2005). Psychopathic Personality Inventory\u2014Revised (PPI-R) professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.</ref> The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two.<ref name=\"gap\" /> Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n====DSM and ICD====\nThere are currently two widely established systems for classifying [[mental disorders]]\u2014the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD) produced by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). Both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general term that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an \"antisocial reaction\" and \"dyssocial reaction\". The latter two eventually became [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) in the DSM and [[dissocial personality disorder]] in the ICD.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a disorder officially titled as such.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref name=\"Handbook of Psychopathy\">{{cite book |last=Patrick |first=Christopher |title=Handbook of Psychopathy |year=2005 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-804-2}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"aspd statement\" />\n\n====Other tools====\nThere are some traditional [[personality tests]] that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (Psychopathic Deviate scale), [[California Psychological Inventory]] (Socialization scale), and [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]] Antisocial Personality Disorder scale. There is also the [[Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale]] (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP), but in terms of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n===Comorbidity===\nAs with other mental disorders, psychopathy as a personality disorder may be present with a variety of other diagnosable conditions. Studies especially suggest strong comorbidity with [[antisocial personality disorder]]. Among numerous studies, positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] [[personality disorder]]s, [[panic disorder|panic]] and [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive\u2013compulsive]] disorders, but not [[neurosis|neurotic]] disorders in general, [[schizophrenia]], or [[major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=\"englandandwales2009\" /><ref name=BlairMitchellBlair>{{cite book |title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain |last=Blair |first=J |author2=Mitchel D |author3=Blair K |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-631-23336-7 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=25\u20137 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27005161/The-Psychopath-Emotion-and-the-Brain |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306020403/https://www.scribd.com/doc/27005161/The-Psychopath-Emotion-and-the-Brain |archivedate=2016-03-06 |df= }}</ref><ref name=Nioche>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.encep.2009.07.004 |title=Psychopathie et troubles de la personnalit\u00e9 associ\u00e9s : Recherche d'un effet particulier au trouble borderline ? |trans-title=Psychopathy and associated personality disorders: Searching for a particular effect of the borderline personality disorder? |language=French |year=2010 |last1=Nioche |first1=A. |last2=Pham |first2=T.H. |last3=Ducro |first3=C. |last4=De Beaurepaire |first4=C. |last5=Chudzik |first5=L. |last6=Courtois |first6=R. |last7=R\u00e9veill\u00e8re |first7=C. |journal=L'Enc\u00e9phale |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=253\u20139 |pmid=20620268}}</ref><ref name=Hildebrand>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2004.03.005 |title=PCL-R psychopathy and its relation to DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders in a sample of male forensic psychiatric patients in the Netherlands |year=2004 |last1=Hildebrand |first1=Martin |last2=De Ruiter |first2=Corine |journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=233\u201348 |pmid=15177992}}</ref><ref name=Nedopil>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3965-6_12 |chapter=Comorbidity of Psychopathy with Major Mental Disorders |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqMZzZ7p3jIC&pg=PA257 |title=Psychopathy: Theory, Research and Implications for Society |year=1998 |last1=Nedopil |first1=Norbert |last2=Hollweg |first2=Matthias |last3=Hartmann |first3=Julia |last4=Jaser |first4=Robert |isbn=978-0-7923-4920-4 |pages=257\u201368}}</ref>\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) is known to be highly comorbid with [[conduct disorder]] (a theorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies.

Men score higher than women on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar [[Factor analysis|factor structure]] for men and women.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nMany associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with [[openness to experience]] in women. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] pattern while in women it manifests more as a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women.

Phytoplankton live in the [[photic zone]] of the ocean, where [[photosynthesis]] is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to [[photodegradation]]. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of [[marine food web]]s, they serve as prey for [[zooplankton]], [[fish larvae]] and other [[heterotrophic]] organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by [[viral lysis]]. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as [[dinoflagellate]]s, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and [[detritus]].<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Culture sizes range from small-scale [[laboratory]] cultures of less than 1L to several tens of thousands of liters for commercial aquaculture.<ref name=mcvey/> Regardless of the size of the culture, certain conditions must be provided for efficient growth of plankton. The majority of cultured plankton is marine, and [[seawater]] of a [[specific gravity]] of 1.010 to 1.026 may be used as a culture medium. This water must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], usually by either high temperatures in an [[autoclave]] or by exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]], to prevent [[biological]] [[contamination]] of the culture. Various [[fertilizers]] are added to the culture medium to facilitate the growth of plankton. A culture must be aerated or agitated in some way to keep plankton suspended, as well as to provide dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] for [[photosynthesis]]. In addition to constant aeration, most cultures are manually mixed or stirred on a regular basis. Light must be provided for the growth of phytoplankton. The [[colour temperature]] of illumination should be approximately 6,500 K, but values from 4,000 K to upwards of 20,000 K have been used successfully. The duration of light exposure should be approximately 16 hours daily; this is the most efficient artificial day length.<ref name=mcvey/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Phytoplankton}}\n{{commons category|Algal blooms}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Algae}}\n* {{annotated link|Algaculture}}\n* {{annotated link|AlgaeBase}}\n* {{annotated link|Bacterioplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Biological pump}}\n* {{annotated link|CLAW hypothesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Cyanobacteria}}\n* {{annotated link|Freshwater phytoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Iron fertilization}}\n* {{annotated link|Microphyte}} (microalgae)\n* {{annotated link|Ocean acidification}}\n* {{annotated link|Paradox of the plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Photosynthetic picoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Whiting event}}\n* {{annotated link|Zooplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Thin layers (oceanography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Harmful algal bloom}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |last1=Greeson |first1=Phillip E. |year=1982 |title=An annotated key to the identification of commonly occurring and dominant genera of Algae observed in the Phytoplankton of the United States |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2079 |isbn=978-0-607-68844-3 }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Richard R. |year=2010 |title=Ocean Drifters: A Secret World Beneath the Waves |publisher=Studio Cactus  |isbn=978-1-904239-10-9 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Ronald |last2=Quigg |first2=Antonietta |title=Tiny Plants That Once Ruled the Seas |journal=Scientific American |volume=308 |issue=6 |year=2013 |pages=40\u20135 |pmid=23729069 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0613-40 |bibcode=2013SciAm.308f..40M }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.secchidisk.org Secchi Disk and Secchi app], a citizen science project to study the phytoplankton\n* [http://vimeo.com/84872751/ Ocean Drifters], a short film narrated by David Attenborough about the varied roles of plankton\n* [http://www.planktonchronicles.org/en Plankton Chronicles], a short documentary films & photos\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214081038/http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/review/dms_climate.html DMS and Climate], NOAA\n* [http://planktonnet.awi.de/ Plankton*Net], images of planktonic species\n\n{{plankton|state=expanded}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Biological oceanography]]\n[[Category:Planktology]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description| Autotrophic members of the plankton ecosystem }}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Diatom]]s are one of the most common types of phytoplankton.]]\n\n'''Phytoplankton''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|f|a\u026a|t|o\u028a|\u02c8|p|l|\u00e6|\u014b|k|t|\u0259|n}}) are the [[autotrophic]] (self-feeding) components of the [[plankton]] community and a key part of oceans, seas and freshwater basin [[Aquatic ecosystem|ecosystem]]s.

Phytoplankton is cultured for a variety of purposes, including foodstock for other aquacultured organisms,<ref name=mcvey/> a nutritional supplement for captive [[invertebrates]] in [[Aquarium|aquaria]]. Culture sizes range from small-scale [[laboratory]] cultures of less than 1L to several tens of thousands of liters for commercial aquaculture.<ref name=mcvey/> Regardless of the size of the culture, certain conditions must be provided for efficient growth of plankton. The majority of cultured plankton is marine, and [[seawater]] of a [[specific gravity]] of 1.010 to 1.026 may be used as a culture medium. This water must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], usually by either high temperatures in an [[autoclave]] or by exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]], to prevent [[biological]] [[contamination]] of the culture. Various [[fertilizers]] are added to the culture medium to facilitate the growth of plankton. A culture must be aerated or agitated in some way to keep plankton suspended, as well as to provide dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] for [[photosynthesis]]. In addition to constant aeration, most cultures are manually mixed or stirred on a regular basis. Light must be provided for the growth of phytoplankton. The [[colour temperature]] of illumination should be approximately 6,500 K, but values from 4,000 K to upwards of 20,000 K have been used successfully. The duration of light exposure should be approximately 16 hours daily; this is the most efficient artificial day length.<ref name=mcvey/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Phytoplankton}}\n{{commons category|Algal blooms}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Algae}}\n* {{annotated link|Algaculture}}\n* {{annotated link|AlgaeBase}}\n* {{annotated link|Bacterioplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Biological pump}}\n* {{annotated link|CLAW hypothesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Cyanobacteria}}\n* {{annotated link|Freshwater phytoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Iron fertilization}}\n* {{annotated link|Microphyte}} (microalgae)\n* {{annotated link|Ocean acidification}}\n* {{annotated link|Paradox of the plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Photosynthetic picoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Whiting event}}\n* {{annotated link|Zooplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Thin layers (oceanography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Harmful algal bloom}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |last1=Greeson |first1=Phillip E. |year=1982 |title=An annotated key to the identification of commonly occurring and dominant genera of Algae observed in the Phytoplankton of the United States |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2079 |isbn=978-0-607-68844-3 }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Richard R. |year=2010 |title=Ocean Drifters: A Secret World Beneath the Waves |publisher=Studio Cactus  |isbn=978-1-904239-10-9 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Ronald |last2=Quigg |first2=Antonietta |title=Tiny Plants That Once Ruled the Seas |journal=Scientific American |volume=308 |issue=6 |year=2013 |pages=40\u20135 |pmid=23729069 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0613-40 |bibcode=2013SciAm.308f..40M }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.secchidisk.org Secchi Disk and Secchi app], a citizen science project to study the phytoplankton\n* [http://vimeo.com/84872751/ Ocean Drifters], a short film narrated by David Attenborough about the varied roles of plankton\n* [http://www.planktonchronicles.org/en Plankton Chronicles], a short documentary films & photos\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214081038/http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/review/dms_climate.html DMS and Climate], NOAA\n* [http://planktonnet.awi.de/ Plankton*Net], images of planktonic species\n\n{{plankton|state=expanded}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Biological oceanography]]\n[[Category:Planktology]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n", "name_user": "Epipelagic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEcology:license", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton"}
