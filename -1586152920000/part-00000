While he was not struggling academically, Jones would repeatedly get in trouble, resulting in him dropping out of high school in the tenth grade.

He released this mixtape with musical guidance from fellow rapper and fellow Atlanta native, [[Young Thug]] and under the label 4PF (4 Pockets Full), Wolfpack and [[Quality Control Music]]. The mixtape featured some well-known names like [[Lil Yachty]] and Thug, but primarily featured underground local artists. Although the mixtape had little promotion, it still performed well and managed to gain attention inside and outside the Atlanta rap scene. Shortly after releasing ''Perfect Timing'' he released his second mixtape, ''Harder Than Hard'' July 18, 2017. The mixtape widened Baby's fame and only gave him more widespread notoriety; with the support of the lead single \"My Dawg\". On October 9, 2017, Baby released a collaboration mixtape with close friend and fellow Atlanta rapper Marlo, ''2 The Hard Way''. This mixtape did not create as big an impact as two former tapes, but still garnered some attention.\nBaby finally started to break through to the masses with his mixtape ''Too Hard'', which was led by his hit single \"Freestyle\", which was released as a music video prior to his mixtape on November 5. Through the success of the single, Baby attracted much attention towards his mixtape. When the mixtape finally dropped it featured the single \"All of a Sudden\" with featuring rapper and friend [[Moneybagg Yo]]. This mixtape was defining for much of Baby's current career.\nIn May 2018, Baby released his debut studio album, ''[[Harder Than Ever]]'', which debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name=\"B200\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8458036/bts-earns-first-no-1-album-billboard-200-chart-love-yourself-tear|title=BTS Earns First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'Love Yourself: Tear'|work=Billboard|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=May 27, 2018|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}</ref> The album was supported by the singles, \"[[Southside (Lil Baby song)|Southside]]\" and \"[[Yes Indeed (song)|Yes Indeed]]\" (with [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), the latter peaked at number six on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8458686/lil-bay-earns-first-hot-100-top-10-yes-indeed|title=Lil Baby Earns First Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 With Drake Collab 'Yes Indeed'|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref>\n\n===2018\u2013present: ''Drip Harder'', ''Street Gossip'' and ''My Turn''===\nAfter he had released ''Harder Than Ever'', he released his collaborative mixtape ''[[Drip Harder]]'' with fellow rapper and close friend,  [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]] on October 5, 2018.

He released this mixtape with musical guidance from fellow rapper and fellow Atlanta native, [[Young Thug]] and under the label 4PF (4 Pockets Full), Wolfpack and [[Quality Control Music]]. The mixtape featured some well-known names like [[Lil Yachty]] and Thug, but primarily featured underground local artists. Although the mixtape had little promotion, it still performed well and managed to gain attention inside and outside the Atlanta rap scene. Shortly after releasing ''Perfect Timing'' he released his second mixtape, ''Harder Than Hard'' July 18, 2017. The mixtape widened Baby's fame and only gave him more widespread notoriety; with the support of the lead single \"My Dawg\". On October 9, 2017, Baby released a collaboration mixtape with close friend and fellow Atlanta rapper Marlo, ''2 The Hard Way''. This mixtape did not create as big an impact as two former tapes, but still garnered some attention.\nBaby finally started to break through to the masses with his mixtape ''Too Hard'', which was led by his hit single \"Freestyle\", which was released as a music video prior to his mixtape on November 5. Through the success of the single, Baby attracted much attention towards his mixtape. When the mixtape finally dropped it featured the single \"All of a Sudden\" with featuring rapper and friend [[Moneybagg Yo]]. This mixtape was defining for much of Baby's current career.\nIn May 2018, Baby released his debut studio album, ''[[Harder Than Ever]]'', which debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name=\"B200\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8458036/bts-earns-first-no-1-album-billboard-200-chart-love-yourself-tear|title=BTS Earns First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'Love Yourself: Tear'|work=Billboard|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=May 27, 2018|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}</ref> The album was supported by the singles, \"[[Southside (Lil Baby song)|Southside]]\" and \"[[Yes Indeed (song)|Yes Indeed]]\" (with [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), the latter peaked at number six on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8458686/lil-bay-earns-first-hot-100-top-10-yes-indeed|title=Lil Baby Earns First Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 With Drake Collab 'Yes Indeed'|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref>\n\n===2018\u2013present: ''Drip Harder'', ''Street Gossip'' and ''My Turn''===\nAfter he had released ''Harder Than Ever'', he released his collaborative mixtape ''[[Drip Harder]]'' with fellow rapper and close friend,  [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]] on October 5, 2018.

O. Allen as a cricketer, and his third name was not used consistently. While at Eton, his initials of G. O. B. Allen gave rise to the nickname \"Gobby\", which in time became \"Gubby\". His family knew him as \"Obie\", but very few of even his close friends and family ever called him \"George\".<ref>Swanton, p. 1.</ref>|group=notes}} [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (31 July 1902 \u2013 29 November 1989) was a [[cricket]]er who [[captain (cricket)|captained]] [[England cricket team|England]] in eleven [[Test cricket|Test]] matches. In [[First-class cricket|first-class matches]], he played for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. A [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]] and hard-hitting [[Batting order (cricket)|lower-order]] batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for [[Eton College]], he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial [[Bodyline]] tour of 1932\u201333, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the [[London Stock Exchange]], which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1936\u201337|1936\u201337 tour of Australia]], when the home team won 3\u20132 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final [[English cricket team in West Indies in 1947\u201348|Test series in the West Indies in 1947\u201348]]. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored [[Run (cricket)|runs]] when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate [[illegal bowling action]]s. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]]. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the [[D'Oliveira affair]], a controversy over the potential selection of [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to [[Lord's]], where he died, aged 87, in 1989.\n\n==Early life==\nAllen was born on 31 July 1902 in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], Sydney, Australia,{{refn|Allen's family had lived in Australia since his great-great-grandparents moved from England in 1816,<ref name=CA>{{cite web|title=Gubby Allen|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/0/559/559.html|website=CricketArchive|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and his paternal uncle, [[Reginald Allen (Australian cricketer)|Reginald Allen]], played cricket for Australia.<ref name=ODNB/><ref>{{cite web|title=Reginald Allen|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/0/99/99.html|website=CricketArchive|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>|group=notes}}<ref name=S20>Swanton, p. 20.</ref> the second of three children to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), ''n\u00e9e'' Lamb, the daughter of [[Edward Lamb (politician)|Edward Lamb]], a [[Queensland]] government minister.

Frith suggests that they may have been spread maliciously by enemies of Allen, but points out that Warner favoured Allen several times during his career, which he followed closely. Frith believes that Allen looked more like Warner than Walter Allen; he states that Warner was an admirer of Pearl Allen in the early 1900s, and was briefly in Australia at roughly the right period. According to Frith, the biography of Warner by Gerald Howat relates that Warner's wife was jealous of Pearl, and suggests that Warner regarded Allen as a \"member of the family\". Howat also calls Allen a \"favoured son\" of Warner.<ref name=father>Frith, pp. 63\u201364.</ref>|group=notes}}<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web | last =Woodcock | first = John| title = Allen, Sir George Oswald Browning (1902\u20131989) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition = online | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40143?docPos=1 | accessdate = 11 March 2013}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref name=father/> Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia.

The family had planned to send Allen to Haileybury, but Wells persuaded Allen senior to send his son to Eton instead, although it was a considerable financial burden on the family.

In reply, England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch almost impossible to bat on. Several critics, including members of his own team, suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult. Allen considered the risk to be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine.<ref>Swanton, pp. 188\u201390.</ref> Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the conditions eased; the tactic worked, as he and Jack Fingleton shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket.

Swanton suggests that, had he played regularly, Allen may have matched the achievements of Larwood.<ref name=S103/> Other critics had reservations. Alan Gibson, in his study of England captains, wrote that Allen \"was a fast bowler, not quite of the highest class\"; he noted that Allen became more accurate as he got older, but this was offset by a loss of pace.<ref name=G169>Gibson, p. 169.</ref> Robertson-Glasgow believed that Allen suffered from not bowling regularly. When called upon to play while lacking practice, he often \"bowled wildly or inconsistently\".<ref>Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> But Woodcock and Robertson-Glasgow believed that, in this period, only Larwood was capable of more devastating spells of fast bowling among Englishmen.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=RG67/>\n\nAs a batsman, Allen was technically sound. Robertson-Glasgow described him as a \"correct, strong and courageous\" batsman who was at his best when his team most needed runs.<ref name=RG67/> Gibson called him as a \"hard-hitting batsman in the middle of the order\".<ref name=G169/> In later years, his understanding of batting technique enabled him to co-write the MCC coaching book.<ref name=obit/> Gibson described Allen as an unlucky captain, affected by injuries and poor selection, who had little opportunity to lead teams. He judged him to be an orthodox tactician, possibly influenced by the fact that his two predecessors, Jardine and Wyatt, often used highly unusual tactics. Gibson stated that Allen was popular with his teams and that his influence during the potentially difficult Australia tour of 1936\u201337 was crucial.<ref>Gibson, pp. 169\u201370.</ref> Wyatt rated him as a good captain, and stated: \"As a captain, he was a disciplinarian but was always most considerate to the members of his side\".<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Administrative career==\nAllen's ''Wisden'' obituary stated: \"[He] had a stronger influence on the welfare and development of cricket than anyone since Lord Harris [who died in 1932] over a period of more than 50 years.\"<ref name=obit/> Gibson, writing in 1979, described Allen as \"a patriarchal, though not aloof, figure at Lord's\".<ref name=G169/> [[Ian Peebles]], a teammate of Allen's at Middlesex and later a journalist, said of him: \"Allen's impact [as an administrator at Lord's] was immediate and it was the foundation of a remarkable career in the course of which he was to initiate and sponsor measures which affected every possible aspect of the game.\"<ref name=Keating/>\n\n===After the Second World War===\nIn the final stages of his playing career, Allen became increasingly influential off the field. After the war, he rejoined the MCC Committee. One of his first actions, prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour<!-- when Hutton commented that although playing for the MCC he was unable to wear the MCC colours as he was not a member -->, was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers.<ref>Swanton, p. 244.</ref> Allen was heavily involved in an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s. Unlike many of the cricketing [[The Establishment|Establishment]], who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority, Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and boys who did not have access to top-class facilities.<ref name=youth>Quelch, \"At last the 1948 show\", Location 673.</ref> In 1951, the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association, of which Allen was a member. Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC coaching book in 1951, which aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country. Allen worked in collaboration with [[Harry Altham]]; Allen was responsible for the technical aspects of the publication.<ref>Swanton, pp. 248\u201349.</ref> In later years, Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator.<ref name=Keating2>{{Cite news | last = Keating| first = Frank| title = Who's fit to play Gubby the gent?| newspaper = The Guardian  | location = London  | page =  19  | date = 26 August 1982}}</ref> In his survey of English cricket in the 1950s, Tim Quelch states that the coaching drive, and other similar initiatives at the time, achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached had little opportunity to play cricket.<ref name=youth/>\n\n===Test selector===\nIn July 1954, Allen was involved in the selection of the MCC team to [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954\u201355|tour Australia in 1954\u201355]], as the MCC's representative. That winter, he travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts and was present when England won three Test matches, which ensured victory in the series.<ref>Swanton, pp. 252\u201353.</ref> Before the 1955 season, he was nominated as the Chairman of Selectors, and as his senior partner at David Bevan had no objection, he accepted. The workload of the post brought his playing days to an end.<ref>Swanton, p. 254.</ref>\n\nAllen served as chairman from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain.<ref>Swanton, p. 255.</ref> Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly.<ref>Swanton, pp. 256\u201357.</ref> While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including [[Ted Dexter]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]], who had successful careers and were part of a strong English batting line-up.<ref>Marshall, pp. 185\u201386.</ref> At least one member of the England team, [[Jim Laker]], resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals.<ref name=Marshall/><ref>Marshall, 253\u201354.</ref> Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place;<ref>{{cite web|last=Steen|first=Rob|title=Dolly Mixture|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/358080.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo; first published in the Wisden Cricketer|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of [[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]] for reasons of class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Jackson (obituary)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550077/Les-Jackson.html|publisher=Telegraph online|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=30 April 2007}}</ref> Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed.<ref name=Marshall>Marshall, pp. 193\u201396.</ref> He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain,<ref>Marshall, p. 201.</ref> and speaking to the press.<ref name=Marshall/> In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship.<ref>Swanton, pp. 257\u201358.</ref> When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.<ref>Swanton, pp. 269\u201370.</ref>\n\nAllen and May's first series in control resulted in a 3\u20132 win over South Africa.<ref>Swanton, pp. 258\u201360.</ref> In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2\u20131. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed for the inclusion of [[Cyril Washbrook]], who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years.<ref name=Sw1956/> The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by [[Bill Bowes]], a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, [[Fred Trueman]], to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place.<ref>Quelch, Chapter 14: \"Look Back in Anger\", Location 4056.</ref> Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, [[David Sheppard]], who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test [[Denis Compton]] was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94.<ref name=Sw1956>Swanton, pp. 261\u201364.</ref> The ''Wisden'' editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: \"I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [the selectors] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer.

The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing the size of the ball would help bowlers.<ref>Swanton, pp. 275\u201376.</ref> Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were [[No-ball#Illegal action by the bowler|no-balled]] for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. [[Geoff Griffin]], a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part.<ref>Swanton, pp. 270\u201371, 276\u201377</ref> Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team.<ref name=obit/><ref>Swanton, p. 278.</ref> Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.<ref name=obit/>\n\nWhen the MCC abolished amateur status in cricket in 1963,<ref>{{Cite news | title = End of Amateurs in Cricket| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  4  | date =1 February 1963}}</ref> making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change.<ref>Swanton, p. 280.</ref> In 1963, he was appointed as MCC President.<ref>Swanton, p. 281.</ref> When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he was appointed to the influential role of MCC Treasurer,<ref>Swanton, pp. 284\u201385.</ref> a position he filled until 1976.<ref name=ODNB/> During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of key positions. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968.<ref>Swanton, pp. 286\u201387.</ref> He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the new [[Test and County Cricket Board]] and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC,<ref>Swanton, pp. 287\u201388.</ref> and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.<ref>Swanton, pp. 293\u201394.</ref>\n\nAllen was prosperous by this stage of his life. An inheritance from his mother, his earnings on the Stock Exchange and the success of investments he had made in Australia left him affluent\u2014his knowledge of Australian markets was respected in the City.<ref>Swanton, p. 279.</ref> In 1965, Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years; he believed that his fast bowling may have brought about his hip problems.<ref>Swanton, p. 286.</ref>\n\n===D'Oliveira affair===\n{{Main|D'Oliveira affair}}\nIn 1968, the MCC was involved in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to tour South Africa, which was then under [[apartheid]]. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour.<ref>Oborne, pp. 145\u201346.</ref> The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead.<ref>Swanton, p. 288.</ref> The [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and former MCC President [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister [[B. J. Vorster]],<ref name=S289/> who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances.<ref>Oborne, pp. 146\u201347.</ref> Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, but that it was likely no protest would be made.<ref name=S289>Swanton, p. 289.</ref> Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer.<ref name=Oborne/> They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team,<ref>Oborne, p. 137.</ref> but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.<ref name=Oborne>Oborne, pp. 148\u201349.</ref>\n\nIn March 1968, [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]], an MCC member who wanted the tour to go ahead,<ref>Oborne, pp. 152\u201354.</ref> met Vorster, who told him that D'Oliveira would not be an acceptable selection to the South African government. Cobham communicated this information to an MCC Committee member, whose identity has never been made public, by private letter. Other than the recipient, only Allen, Griffith and the then-President [[Arthur Gilligan]] were aware of the letter, but they chose to keep its contents from the rest of the Committee.<ref name=S289/> Allen's justification was that Douglas-Home, a statesman and former Prime Minister, had given advice which contradicted this; also, other Committee members were Test selectors and Allen believed that the information would place non-cricketing pressures on their choices for the England team.<ref>Swanton, p. 290.</ref> Oborne suggests that Douglas-Home's advice was made redundant by Cobham's letter, and that Allen's supposed desire to protect the other selectors was \"preposterous\" as the tour would have been cancelled.<ref>Oborne, pp. 154\u201355.</ref>\n\nWhen the English selectors met to choose the team, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC; they had no official say in the selection, but Oborne suggests that Allen made it clear that he considered D'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on cricketing grounds.<ref>Oborne, pp. 193\u201394.</ref> D'Oliveira was eventually left out, to considerable anger and controversy. When he was later added to the team following an injury to another player, Vorster said that the MCC would not be welcome and the tour was cancelled.<ref>Oborne, pp. 201\u201328.</ref> Some of the events leading up to D'Oliveira's exclusion became public knowledge the following year; the MCC came under heavy public pressure, and the press called for Allen to resign.<ref>Swanton, p. 291.</ref> Oborne suggests that Allen, although not a supporter of apartheid, wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa; he regarded opponents of apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment.<ref>Oborne, p. 212.</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the proposed visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC was no longer solely responsible for any decisions, being only a part of the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.<ref>Swanton, pp. 292\u201393.</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nAllen retired from the Stock Exchange in 1972, resigned as MCC Treasurer in 1976 and left the Cricket Council in 1982.<ref name=ODNB/> He was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1962 and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1986.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1968, Allen moved to a flat directly behind the Pavilion at Lord's,<ref>Swanton, pp. 291\u201392.</ref> where he lived until his death.<ref name=ODNB/> Following his retirement, he spent much of his time in the MCC Committee room, watching cricket at Lord's.<ref name=ODNB/> He never married,<ref name=Keating2/> and died at home on 29 November 1989,<ref name=ODNB/> suffering from the effects of a stomach operation earlier in the year.<ref name=Cricinfo/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Commons category|Gubby Allen}}\n*{{cite book  |last = Douglas  |first = Christopher  |title = Douglas Jardine: Spartan Cricketer  |publisher = Methuen  |year = 2002  |location= London  |isbn = 0-413-77216-0}}\n*{{cite book |last = Frith  |first = David |title = Bodyline Autopsy.

O. Allen as a cricketer, and his third name was not used consistently. While at Eton, his initials of G. O. B. Allen gave rise to the nickname \"Gobby\", which in time became \"Gubby\". His family knew him as \"Obie\", but very few of even his close friends and family ever called him \"George\".<ref>Swanton, p. 1.</ref>|group=notes}} [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (31 July 1902 \u2013 29 November 1989) was a [[cricket]]er who [[captain (cricket)|captained]] [[England cricket team|England]] in eleven [[Test cricket|Test]] matches. In [[First-class cricket|first-class matches]], he played for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. A [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]] and hard-hitting [[Batting order (cricket)|lower-order]] batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for [[Eton College]], he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial [[Bodyline]] tour of 1932\u201333, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the [[London Stock Exchange]], which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1936\u201337|1936\u201337 tour of Australia]], when the home team won 3\u20132 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final [[English cricket team in West Indies in 1947\u201348|Test series in the West Indies in 1947\u201348]]. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored [[Run (cricket)|runs]] when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate [[illegal bowling action]]s. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]]. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the [[D'Oliveira affair]], a controversy over the potential selection of [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to [[Lord's]], where he died, aged 87, in 1989.\n\n==Early life==\nAllen was born on 31 July 1902 in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], Sydney, Australia,{{refn|Allen's family had lived in Australia since his great-great-grandparents moved from England in 1816,<ref name=CA>{{cite web|title=Gubby Allen|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/0/559/559.html|website=CricketArchive|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and his paternal uncle, [[Reginald Allen (Australian cricketer)|Reginald Allen]], played cricket for Australia.<ref name=ODNB/><ref>{{cite web|title=Reginald Allen|url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/0/99/99.html|website=CricketArchive|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>|group=notes}}<ref name=S20>Swanton, p. 20.</ref> the second of three children to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), ''n\u00e9e'' Lamb, the daughter of [[Edward Lamb (politician)|Edward Lamb]], a [[Queensland]] government minister.

Frith suggests that they may have been spread maliciously by enemies of Allen, but points out that Warner favoured Allen several times during his career, which he followed closely. Frith believes that Allen looked more like Warner than Walter Allen; he states that Warner was an admirer of Pearl Allen in the early 1900s, and was briefly in Australia at roughly the right period. According to Frith, the biography of Warner by Gerald Howat relates that Warner's wife was jealous of Pearl, and suggests that Warner regarded Allen as a \"member of the family\".

He played twice before withdrawing from the rest of the season on medical advice.<ref>Swanton, pp. 159\u201360.</ref> Off the field, Allen was elected to the MCC Committee at the unusually young age of 32.<ref>Swanton, p. 209.</ref>\n\n==England captain==\n[[File:Gubby Allen c1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Allen c. 1935]]\n===Selection as captain===\nPrior to the 1936 season, Allen was the leading contender to replace Wyatt as England captain; under Wyatt's leadership, the team had lost three successive Test series.<ref>Swanton, pp. 161, 164.</ref> Although still unable to appear regularly,<ref name=S161>Swanton, p. 161.</ref> Allen played 16 first-class matches, his most in a season since 1926; he scored 598 runs at an average of 35.17, and took 81 wickets, his best return in a season.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> When selected to lead one of the teams in a Test trial match, he was effective enough for the selectors to name him as England captain for the series against India.<ref>Swanton, pp. 162\u201364.</ref> England won the first Test by eight wickets.

At least one selector favoured [[Claude Ashton]], who played first-class cricket infrequently; Allen informed the selectors that, were Ashton to be made captain, he would not take part in the tour.<ref name=M114>Marshall, p. 114.</ref> Soon after the first Test, Allen was chosen to captain the Gentlemen against the Players, the only time he did so, and the MCC announced that he would captain the MCC in Australia.<ref>Swanton, p. 167.</ref> Allen believed that Warner was influential in securing his appointment, but that his Australian background was also important given that the tour had to repair tensions left over from 1932\u201333.<ref name=M114/>\n\nAllen captained England in the remaining two Tests against India.

He met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline.

When the Test series began, Australia were clear favourites.<ref>Swanton, pp. 179\u201380.</ref> In the first Test, in reply to England's first innings of 358, Australia were bowled out for 234. When England batted again, Allen top-scored with 68, an innings he later rated the best of his career. England made 256 and, on a pitch affected by rain, Allen took five for 36 as Australia were bowled out for 58 to lose by 322 runs.<ref>Swanton, pp. 181\u201382.</ref> Allen's team also won the second Test. England scored 426 for six on the first two days before rain prompted Allen to declare. On a damaged pitch, he took four for 10; Australia were bowled out for 80 and eventually lost by an innings.<ref>Swanton, pp. 184\u201385.</ref> During the second Australian innings, Bradman, the Australian captain, who went on to score 82, was at one point dropped by Robins. The latter apologised, but Allen replied: \"Oh, forget it, old boy, it's probably cost us the rubber, but what the hell!\"<ref name=S186>Swanton, p. 186.</ref>\n\nRain affected the third Test; on the second day, Australia declared having scored 200 for nine in their first innings. In reply, England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch almost impossible to bat on. Several critics, including members of his own team, suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult. Allen considered the risk to be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine.<ref>Swanton, pp. 188\u201390.</ref> Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the conditions eased; the tactic worked, as he and Jack Fingleton shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket. Bradman scored 270 and England were defeated by 365 runs.<ref>Swanton, pp. 190\u201391.</ref> In the fourth Test, Australia were bowled out for 288 in their first innings, when several of Allen's tactical moves worked well. England replied with 330, and Australia scored 433 in the second innings. Needing to score 392 to win, England were bowled out for 243, and the series was level at 2\u20132.<ref>Swanton, pp. 193\u201396.</ref>\n\nComplaining of exhaustion,<ref name=Sw198/> and struggling with an injury,<ref name=Wis38/> Allen rested from the MCC's next tour games.

In 1948, he scored 180 in the fixture, the highest score of his career; in combination with his success in Middlesex matches, he finished on top of the English batting averages that season.<ref>Swanton, pp. 242\u201343.</ref> He played his final Middlesex games in 1950, captaining the team in four matches in the absence of the regular captain,<ref>Swanton, p. 248.</ref> and made his final first-class appearance for the Free Foresters in 1954.<ref name=figures/> In all first-class cricket, he scored 9,233 runs at an average of 28.67 and took 788 wickets at 22.23.<ref name=Cricinfo/>\n\n==Cricketing technique==\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F6CE |salign=left| quote =He bowls really fast, with an action answering to classical requirements, sideways on, left shoulder seen momentarily by the batsman, then a strong urgent swing over, after a run to attack that is sturdy and galloping and not too long.|source = [[Neville Cardus]]<ref name=Keating>Quoted in {{Cite news | last = Keating| first = Frank| title = Who's fit to play Gubby the gent?| newspaper = The Guardian  | location = London  | page =  19  | date = 26 August 1982}}</ref>|align=right| width=300px}}\nAllen was capable of bowling unusually quickly. Critics judged him to have an excellent [[bowling action]],<ref name=obit>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155342.html| title =Gubby Allen (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1990 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 29 January 2014}}</ref> through which he achieved his pace.<ref name=ODNB/> He bowled from sideways on,<ref name=S148/> and according to his ''Wisden'' obituary, had \"a rhythmical run-up and full follow-through\".<ref name=obit/> [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]] described Allen in 1943: \"Of no more than medium height, he has a solid yet elastic strength, every unit of which is used in the delivery and in a follow-through which is the finest I have ever seen.\"<ref name=RG67>Robertson-Glasgow, p. 67.</ref> Robertson-Glasgow continued: \"His bowling, though it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous irrelevance, has often touched greatness.\"<ref name=RG67/> Although opposed to Bodyline tactics in Australia, Allen often bowled short to intimidate batsmen in county cricket\u2014for example, he once struck Wyatt over the heart with a fast ball.<ref>Marshall, p. 16.</ref><ref>Douglas, pp. 133, 135.</ref>\n\n[[File:Allen bowling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Allen bowling in 1932|alt=A cricketer pictured just after having bowled the ball]]\nDuring the early part of his career, Allen was often in competition with Larwood. Swanton suggests that, had he played regularly, Allen may have matched the achievements of Larwood.<ref name=S103/> Other critics had reservations. Alan Gibson, in his study of England captains, wrote that Allen \"was a fast bowler, not quite of the highest class\"; he noted that Allen became more accurate as he got older, but this was offset by a loss of pace.<ref name=G169>Gibson, p. 169.</ref> Robertson-Glasgow believed that Allen suffered from not bowling regularly. When called upon to play while lacking practice, he often \"bowled wildly or inconsistently\".<ref>Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> But Woodcock and Robertson-Glasgow believed that, in this period, only Larwood was capable of more devastating spells of fast bowling among Englishmen.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=RG67/>\n\nAs a batsman, Allen was technically sound. Robertson-Glasgow described him as a \"correct, strong and courageous\" batsman who was at his best when his team most needed runs.<ref name=RG67/> Gibson called him as a \"hard-hitting batsman in the middle of the order\".<ref name=G169/> In later years, his understanding of batting technique enabled him to co-write the MCC coaching book.<ref name=obit/> Gibson described Allen as an unlucky captain, affected by injuries and poor selection, who had little opportunity to lead teams. He judged him to be an orthodox tactician, possibly influenced by the fact that his two predecessors, Jardine and Wyatt, often used highly unusual tactics. Gibson stated that Allen was popular with his teams and that his influence during the potentially difficult Australia tour of 1936\u201337 was crucial.<ref>Gibson, pp. 169\u201370.</ref> Wyatt rated him as a good captain, and stated: \"As a captain, he was a disciplinarian but was always most considerate to the members of his side\".<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Administrative career==\nAllen's ''Wisden'' obituary stated: \"[He] had a stronger influence on the welfare and development of cricket than anyone since Lord Harris [who died in 1932] over a period of more than 50 years.\"<ref name=obit/> Gibson, writing in 1979, described Allen as \"a patriarchal, though not aloof, figure at Lord's\".<ref name=G169/> [[Ian Peebles]], a teammate of Allen's at Middlesex and later a journalist, said of him: \"Allen's impact [as an administrator at Lord's] was immediate and it was the foundation of a remarkable career in the course of which he was to initiate and sponsor measures which affected every possible aspect of the game.\"<ref name=Keating/>\n\n===After the Second World War===\nIn the final stages of his playing career, Allen became increasingly influential off the field. After the war, he rejoined the MCC Committee. One of his first actions, prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour<!-- when Hutton commented that although playing for the MCC he was unable to wear the MCC colours as he was not a member -->, was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers.<ref>Swanton, p. 244.</ref> Allen was heavily involved in an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s. Unlike many of the cricketing [[The Establishment|Establishment]], who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority, Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and boys who did not have access to top-class facilities.<ref name=youth>Quelch, \"At last the 1948 show\", Location 673.</ref> In 1951, the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association, of which Allen was a member. Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC coaching book in 1951, which aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country. Allen worked in collaboration with [[Harry Altham]]; Allen was responsible for the technical aspects of the publication.<ref>Swanton, pp. 248\u201349.</ref> In later years, Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator.<ref name=Keating2>{{Cite news | last = Keating| first = Frank| title = Who's fit to play Gubby the gent?| newspaper = The Guardian  | location = London  | page =  19  | date = 26 August 1982}}</ref> In his survey of English cricket in the 1950s, Tim Quelch states that the coaching drive, and other similar initiatives at the time, achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached had little opportunity to play cricket.<ref name=youth/>\n\n===Test selector===\nIn July 1954, Allen was involved in the selection of the MCC team to [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954\u201355|tour Australia in 1954\u201355]], as the MCC's representative. That winter, he travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts and was present when England won three Test matches, which ensured victory in the series.<ref>Swanton, pp. 252\u201353.</ref> Before the 1955 season, he was nominated as the Chairman of Selectors, and as his senior partner at David Bevan had no objection, he accepted. The workload of the post brought his playing days to an end.<ref>Swanton, p. 254.</ref>\n\nAllen served as chairman from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain.<ref>Swanton, p. 255.</ref> Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly.<ref>Swanton, pp. 256\u201357.</ref> While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including [[Ted Dexter]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]], who had successful careers and were part of a strong English batting line-up.<ref>Marshall, pp. 185\u201386.</ref> At least one member of the England team, [[Jim Laker]], resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals.<ref name=Marshall/><ref>Marshall, 253\u201354.</ref> Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place;<ref>{{cite web|last=Steen|first=Rob|title=Dolly Mixture|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/358080.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo; first published in the Wisden Cricketer|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of [[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]] for reasons of class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Jackson (obituary)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550077/Les-Jackson.html|publisher=Telegraph online|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=30 April 2007}}</ref> Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed.<ref name=Marshall>Marshall, pp. 193\u201396.</ref> He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain,<ref>Marshall, p. 201.</ref> and speaking to the press.<ref name=Marshall/> In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship.<ref>Swanton, pp. 257\u201358.</ref> When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.<ref>Swanton, pp. 269\u201370.</ref>\n\nAllen and May's first series in control resulted in a 3\u20132 win over South Africa.<ref>Swanton, pp. 258\u201360.</ref> In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2\u20131. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed for the inclusion of [[Cyril Washbrook]], who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years.<ref name=Sw1956/> The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by [[Bill Bowes]], a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, [[Fred Trueman]], to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place.<ref>Quelch, Chapter 14: \"Look Back in Anger\", Location 4056.</ref> Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, [[David Sheppard]], who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test [[Denis Compton]] was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94.<ref name=Sw1956>Swanton, pp. 261\u201364.</ref> The ''Wisden'' editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: \"I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [the selectors] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was too much trouble for them.\"<ref>{{Cite web| last=Preston| first= Norman| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152625.html | title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1957 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 20 May 2013}}</ref> Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to give a lot of assistance to spin bowlers, which led to Laker's extraordinary success in the series.

The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing the size of the ball would help bowlers.<ref>Swanton, pp. 275\u201376.</ref> Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were [[No-ball#Illegal action by the bowler|no-balled]] for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. [[Geoff Griffin]], a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part.<ref>Swanton, pp. 270\u201371, 276\u201377</ref> Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team.<ref name=obit/><ref>Swanton, p. 278.</ref> Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.<ref name=obit/>\n\nWhen the MCC abolished amateur status in cricket in 1963,<ref>{{Cite news | title = End of Amateurs in Cricket| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  4  | date =1 February 1963}}</ref> making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change.<ref>Swanton, p. 280.</ref> In 1963, he was appointed as MCC President.<ref>Swanton, p. 281.</ref> When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he was appointed to the influential role of MCC Treasurer,<ref>Swanton, pp. 284\u201385.</ref> a position he filled until 1976.<ref name=ODNB/> During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of key positions. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968.<ref>Swanton, pp. 286\u201387.</ref> He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the new [[Test and County Cricket Board]] and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC,<ref>Swanton, pp. 287\u201388.</ref> and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.<ref>Swanton, pp. 293\u201394.</ref>\n\nAllen was prosperous by this stage of his life. An inheritance from his mother, his earnings on the Stock Exchange and the success of investments he had made in Australia left him affluent\u2014his knowledge of Australian markets was respected in the City.<ref>Swanton, p. 279.</ref> In 1965, Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years; he believed that his fast bowling may have brought about his hip problems.<ref>Swanton, p. 286.</ref>\n\n===D'Oliveira affair===\n{{Main|D'Oliveira affair}}\nIn 1968, the MCC was involved in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to tour South Africa, which was then under [[apartheid]]. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour.<ref>Oborne, pp. 145\u201346.</ref> The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead.<ref>Swanton, p. 288.</ref> The [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and former MCC President [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister [[B. J. Vorster]],<ref name=S289/> who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances.<ref>Oborne, pp. 146\u201347.</ref> Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, but that it was likely no protest would be made.<ref name=S289>Swanton, p. 289.</ref> Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer.<ref name=Oborne/> They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team,<ref>Oborne, p. 137.</ref> but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.<ref name=Oborne>Oborne, pp. 148\u201349.</ref>\n\nIn March 1968, [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]], an MCC member who wanted the tour to go ahead,<ref>Oborne, pp. 152\u201354.</ref> met Vorster, who told him that D'Oliveira would not be an acceptable selection to the South African government. Cobham communicated this information to an MCC Committee member, whose identity has never been made public, by private letter. Other than the recipient, only Allen, Griffith and the then-President [[Arthur Gilligan]] were aware of the letter, but they chose to keep its contents from the rest of the Committee.<ref name=S289/> Allen's justification was that Douglas-Home, a statesman and former Prime Minister, had given advice which contradicted this; also, other Committee members were Test selectors and Allen believed that the information would place non-cricketing pressures on their choices for the England team.<ref>Swanton, p. 290.</ref> Oborne suggests that Douglas-Home's advice was made redundant by Cobham's letter, and that Allen's supposed desire to protect the other selectors was \"preposterous\" as the tour would have been cancelled.<ref>Oborne, pp. 154\u201355.</ref>\n\nWhen the English selectors met to choose the team, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC; they had no official say in the selection, but Oborne suggests that Allen made it clear that he considered D'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on cricketing grounds.<ref>Oborne, pp. 193\u201394.</ref> D'Oliveira was eventually left out, to considerable anger and controversy. When he was later added to the team following an injury to another player, Vorster said that the MCC would not be welcome and the tour was cancelled.<ref>Oborne, pp. 201\u201328.</ref> Some of the events leading up to D'Oliveira's exclusion became public knowledge the following year; the MCC came under heavy public pressure, and the press called for Allen to resign.<ref>Swanton, p. 291.</ref> Oborne suggests that Allen, although not a supporter of apartheid, wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa; he regarded opponents of apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment.<ref>Oborne, p. 212.</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the proposed visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC was no longer solely responsible for any decisions, being only a part of the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.<ref>Swanton, pp. 292\u201393.</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nAllen retired from the Stock Exchange in 1972, resigned as MCC Treasurer in 1976 and left the Cricket Council in 1982.<ref name=ODNB/> He was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1962 and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1986.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1968, Allen moved to a flat directly behind the Pavilion at Lord's,<ref>Swanton, pp. 291\u201392.</ref> where he lived until his death.<ref name=ODNB/> Following his retirement, he spent much of his time in the MCC Committee room, watching cricket at Lord's.<ref name=ODNB/> He never married,<ref name=Keating2/> and died at home on 29 November 1989,<ref name=ODNB/> suffering from the effects of a stomach operation earlier in the year.<ref name=Cricinfo/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Commons category|Gubby Allen}}\n*{{cite book  |last = Douglas  |first = Christopher  |title = Douglas Jardine: Spartan Cricketer  |publisher = Methuen  |year = 2002  |location= London  |isbn = 0-413-77216-0}}\n*{{cite book |last = Frith  |first = David |title = Bodyline Autopsy.

The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nThe government in Ireland released sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
