''The Mousetrap'' opened in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1952, and has been running continuously since then. The [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running West End show]], it has by far the longest initial run of any play in history, with its 25,000th performance taking place on 18 November 2012.<ref name=\"telegraph18nov12\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/9686732/Agatha-Christies-The-Mousetrap-celebrates-its-60th-anniversary-with-star-studded-show.html | title=Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap celebrates its 60th anniversary with star-studded show | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=18 Nov 2012 | accessdate=November 19, 2012 | author=Marsden, Sam | location=London}}</ref> The play has a [[Plot twist|twist ending]], which the audience are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the theatre.\n\n==History==\nThe play began life as a short [[Radio drama|radio play]] written as a birthday present for [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], the consort of [[George V|King George&nbsp;V]]. It was broadcast on 30 May 1947 under the name ''[[Three Blind Mice (radio play and short story)|Three Blind Mice]]''. The story drew from the real-life case of [[Dennis O'Neill case|Dennis O'Neill]], who died after he and his brother Terence suffered extreme abuse while in the [[foster care]] of a [[Shropshire]] farmer and his wife in 1945.\n\nThe play is based on a [[short story]], itself based on the radio play, but Christie asked that the story not be published as long as it ran as a play in the [[West End of London]]. The short story has still not been published within the United Kingdom but it has appeared in the United States in the 1950 collection ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]''.\n\nWhen she wrote the play, Christie gave the rights to her grandson Mathew Prichard as a birthday present. In the United Kingdom, only one production of the play in addition to the West End production can be performed annually,<ref>Haining, Peter. ''Agatha Christie \u2013 Murder in Four Acts''. (Page 23). Virgin Books, 1990. {{ISBN|1-85227-273-2}}</ref> and under the contract terms of the play, no [[film adaptation]] can be produced until the West End production has been closed for at least six months.\n\nThe play had to be renamed at the insistence of [[Emile Littler]] who had produced a play called ''Three Blind Mice'' in the West End before the [[Second World War]].<ref>Saunders, Peter. ''The Mousetrap Man''. (Page 118) Collins, 1972. {{ISBN|0-00-211538-7}}</ref> The suggestion to call it ''The Mousetrap'' came from Christie's son-in-law, Anthony Hicks.<ref>[[Janet Morgan, Lady Balfour of Burleigh|Morgan, Janet]]. ''Agatha Christie, A Biography''. (Page 291) Collins, 1984 {{ISBN|0-00-216330-6}}.</ref> In Shakespeare's play ''[[Hamlet]]'', \"The Mousetrap\" is Hamlet's answer to Claudius's inquiry about the name of the play whose prologue and first scene the court has just observed (III, ii). The play is actually ''The Murder of Gonzago'', but Hamlet answers metaphorically, since \"the play's the thing\" in which he intends to \"catch the conscience of the king.\" ''Three Blind Mice'' or its tune is heard a few times during the play.\n\nThe play's longevity has ensured its popularity with tourists from around the world. In 1997, at the initiative of producer [[Stephen Waley-Cohen]], the theatrical education charity Mousetrap Theatre Projects was launched, helping young people experience London's theatre.<ref name=MTP>[http://www.mousetrap.org.uk/index.php/about-us/history.html \"Mousetrap Theatre Projects \u2013 History\"], ''Mousetrap Theatre Projects'', March 15, 2012.

It was originally directed by [[Peter Cotes]], elder brother of [[John and Roy Boulting]], the film directors. Its pre-West End tour then took it to the [[New Theatre Oxford]], the [[Manchester Opera House]], the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]], the [[Theatre Royal, Newcastle]], the [[Grand Theatre Leeds]] and the [[New Alexandra Theatre|Alexandra Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]] before it began its run in [[London]] on 25 November 1952 at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]]. It ran at this theatre until Saturday, 23 March 1974 when it immediately transferred to the larger [[St Martin's Theatre]], next door, where it reopened on Monday, 25 March thus keeping its \"initial run\" status. The London run has now exceeded 26,000 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-mousetrap.co.uk |title=Mousetrap website |publisher=The-mousetrap.co.uk |accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref>  The director of the play for many years has been David Turner.\n\nChristie herself did not expect ''The Mousetrap'' to run for such a long time.  In her autobiography, she reports a conversation that she had with [[Peter Saunders (theatre)|Peter Saunders]]: \"Fourteen months I am going to give it\", says Saunders.  To which Christie replies, \"It won't run that long.  Eight months perhaps.  Yes, I think eight months.\"<ref name=Pendergast2004 /> When it broke the record for the longest run of a play in the West End in September 1957, Christie received a mildly grudging [[telegram]] from fellow playwright [[No\u00ebl Coward]]: \"Much as it pains me I really must congratulate you&nbsp;...\" In 2011 (by which time ''The Mousetrap'' had been running for almost 59 years) this long-lost document was found by a [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]] furniture maker who was renovating a bureau purchased by a client from the Christie estate.<ref>''Antiques Trade Gazette'', Issue 2003, 20 August 2001, page 14. Found with the telegram was a [[lingerie]] bill from 1952 for \u00a324.13s. 6d.</ref>\n\nThe original [[West End theatre|West End]] cast included [[Richard Attenborough]] as Detective Sergeant Trotter and his wife [[Sheila Sim]] as Mollie Ralston. They took a 10% profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary (\"It proved to be the wisest business decision I've ever made&nbsp;... but foolishly I sold some of my share to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called 'The Little Elephant' and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' afloat.\")<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; page 180; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-09-950304-0}}</ref>\n\nSince the retirement of [[Mysie Monte]] and [[David Raven (actor)|David Raven]], who each made history by remaining in the cast for more than 11 years, in their roles as Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf, the cast has been changed annually. The change usually occurs around late November around the anniversary of the play's opening, and was the initiative of Sir Peter Saunders, the original producer. There is a tradition of the retiring [[leading lady]] and the new leading lady cutting a \"Mousetrap cake\" together.\n\nThe play has also made theatrical history by having an original \"cast member\" survive all the cast changes since its opening night. The late [[Deryck Guyler]] can still be heard, via a recording, reading the radio news bulletin in the play to this present day. The set was changed in 1965 and 1999, but one prop survives from the original opening \u2013 the clock which sits on the mantelpiece of the fireplace in the main hall.\n[[File:Mousetrap 22461.JPG|thumb|22,461st performance (St Martin's Theatre \u2013 November 2006)]]\nNotable milestones in the play's history include:\n* 6 October 1952 \u2013 First performance at the [[Theatre Royal, Nottingham]]\n* 22 April 1955 \u2013 1,000th performance\n* 13 September 1957 \u2013 Longest-ever run of a \"straight\" play in the West End\n* 12 April 1958 \u2013 Longest-ever run of a show in the West End with 2,239 performances (the previous holder was ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'')\n* 9 December 1964 \u2013 5,000th performance\n* 17 December 1976 \u2013 10,000th performance\n* 16 December 2000 \u2013 20,000th performance\n* 25 November 2002 \u2013 50th anniversary; a special performance was attended by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"telegraph18nov12\" />\n* 18 November 2012 \u2013 25,000th performance\n\nIn May 2001 (during the London production's 49th year, and to mark the 25th anniversary of Christie's death) the cast gave a semi-staged Sunday performance at the [[Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea]] as a guest contribution to the ''Agatha Christie Theatre Festival 2001'', a twelve-week history-making cycle of all of Agatha Christie's plays presented by [[Roy Marsden]]'s  New Palace Theatre Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=61377 |title=PR Newswire report of event |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=January 2001 |accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nA staging at the [[Toronto Truck Theatre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], that opened on 19 August 1977 became Canada's longest running show, before finally closing on 18 January 2004 after a run of twenty-six years and over 9,000 performances.\n\nOn 18 November 2012, both the 25,000th performance and the 60th year of the production were marked by a special charity performance which featured [[Hugh Bonneville]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Julie Walters]] and [[Miranda Hart]].

''The Mousetrap and Other Plays''. Signet, 2000. {{ISBN|0-451-20114-0}}</ref>\n\n===Act I===\nAct I opens with the murder of a woman named Maureen Lyon, played out in sound only. The action then moves to Monkswell Manor, recently converted to a guesthouse and run by a young couple, Mollie and Giles Ralston.  While waiting for the guests to arrive, Mollie listens to a radio report about the Lyon murder, which notes that police are looking for a man in a dark overcoat, observed near the scene.\n\nTheir four guests arrive. Christopher Wren is an unkempt, flighty young man. Giles reacts strongly to Wren with instant dislike and Mollie with instinctual trust. Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf then arrive together in a taxi from the station. Mrs Boyle complains about many things; Metcalf is an amiable ex-military man.  Miss Casewell, a mannish young woman, is the last of the booked guests to arrive, before an unexpected fifth party appears. Identifying himself in a foreign accent as Mr Paravicini, he tells the Ralstons his car has overturned in a snowdrift. He remarks that the snow has blocked the roads and that the denizens of the house are trapped. Uneasy about Paravicini's manner, Mollie nevertheless places him in the last remaining room.\n\nThe next afternoon the guest house proves to be snowed in, and the residents are restless. Mollie answers the telephone to Superintendent Hogben of the Berkshire Police. Hogben tells her that he is dispatching Sergeant Trotter to the guest house, and that the Ralstons must listen carefully to what Trotter has to tell them. The Ralstons wonder what they could have done to garner police attention.\n\nTrotter appears at the door on a pair of skis and Major Metcalf discovers that the phone has stopped working.\n\nTrotter explains he has been sent in regard to the murder of Maureen Lyon. In a story loosely based on the real [[Dennis O'Neill case]], the dead woman and her husband had mistreated their three foster children, resulting in the death of the youngest. Both adults were imprisoned for their actions; the husband died in gaol, while the wife served her sentence and had been released, only to be found strangled. Police suspect the elder boy of the abused children, who would now be twenty-two, of being the killer.\n\nTrotter reveals that a notebook found at the murder scene contained the address of Monkswell Manor and the words \"Three Blind Mice\". A note reading \"This is the First\" was pinned to the woman's body. The police have sent Trotter to find out how the Ralstons' guesthouse is connected to the murder and whether the residents are in danger. Both Giles and Mollie deny a connection to the case, though Mollie is ill at ease answering Trotter's questions and quickly excuses herself. Trotter asks each of the guests to explain why they are at Monkswell Manor and any connection they have to the foster children. All five guests deny any personal knowledge of the case.\n\nWhile Trotter and Giles tour the house, Major Metcalf confronts Mrs Boyle, revealing that she was one of the magistrates who had assigned the children to the foster parents. Mrs Boyle acknowledges this but denies that she has any responsibility for what eventually happened to the children there.\n\nAs the evening wears on, Giles and Mollie become suspicious of each other while the guests snipe at one another. Sergeant Trotter traces the phone wire to find out if it has been cut. Mrs Boyle wanders back into the now-empty room and listens to the radio. The opening notes of \"Three Blind Mice\" are heard whistled by an unknown party and Mrs Boyle responds without alarm, speaking to the person only she can see. Suddenly, the lights go out and a scuffle is heard. Moments later, Mollie walks into the room and turns on the lights, only to find Mrs Boyle dead on the floor.\n\n===Act II===\nTen minutes after Mollie finds Mrs Boyle dead of strangulation, Sergeant Trotter takes charge of the household. All the remaining residents are gathered in one room as he attempts to sort out the events of the evening. A shaken Mollie Ralston cannot provide him with any useful clues; the only thing she is sure she observed was the radio blaring. Frustrated, Trotter points out that their lives continue to be in danger; a third murder could very well happen, given the notes left with Maureen Lyon. He insists that everyone tell him where they were when Mrs Boyle was murdered. As each person recounts his or her whereabouts, Trotter takes them to account for inconsistencies or weaknesses in their stories. Finally, he declares that everyone in the house had the opportunity to commit the murder, since each of them was alone at the time. Giles counters that while seven people in the house lack alibis, only one fits the description of the man the police suspect to be the murderer: Christopher Wren. Wren insists that it is all a [[frame-up]], and Trotter acknowledges that he lacks any evidence pointing to Wren in particular.\n\nMollie later pulls Trotter aside; Trotter says that while the police suspect the elder boy to be the killer, the dead boy also had relatives and loved ones who might be interested in revenge: the children's father, an army sergeant, for example; or the dead boy's sister, who would now be a young woman. Trotter notes that Metcalf or Paravicini could be the father, Miss Casewell or Mollie could be the sister, and Giles could be the elder boy. Mollie, aghast, objects to the notion that either she or Giles could be a murderer, but Trotter forces her to admit that they know little about each other's pasts.\n\nMollie soon finds herself in conversation with Christopher Wren, who confesses that he is actually an army deserter hiding from his past under a false name. Mollie acknowledges that she, too, is running away from her past. Despite the trust Christopher and Mollie are forming, he and Giles each suspect the other and nearly come to blows over Mollie. The situation is only defused by the arrival of Paravicini, who tells the company that Trotter's skis are missing.\n\nTrotter again calls an assembly of the household, declaring that he now intends to check the alibis everyone provided to him after Mrs Boyle's murder. They will re-enact the murder, with each member of the household acting out another's alibi. Trotter's hope is that while most of the alibis will be verified, one will be proved impossible. Each person is to go to his or her assigned position and stay there until summoned back by Trotter. The household obediently disperses, leaving Trotter alone onstage.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe play made little stir in the review pages of the British press when it opened. ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' commented that it was \"a middling piece\" with \"less in it than meets the eye&nbsp;... Coincidence is stretched unreasonably.\" The critic commented that the characters were \"built entirely of clich\u00e9s\".<ref>\"'The Mousetrap': New Comedy-Thriller by Agatha Christie\", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 27 November 1952, p. 3</ref> The reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' was more favourably disposed to the characters, calling them \"nicely assorted, individually labelled and readily identified\", and found the plot \"elaborately skilful.\"<ref>\"Ambassadors Theatre\", ''The Times'', 26 November 1952, p. 12</ref> In ''[[The Daily Express]]'' John Barber praised \"the atmosphere of shuddering suspense\" but thought some of the characters \"too obvious by half\".<ref>Barber, John. \"Who Instead of How\", ''The Daily Express'', 26 November 1952, p. 3</ref> In ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', [[J.

It was first published in hardback in ''[[The Mousetrap and Other Plays]]'' by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in 1978 ({{ISBN|0-396-07631-9}}).\n\n==Film versions==\nIn 1959 it was announced that [[Edward Small]], who had produced ''Witness for the Prosecution'' for the screen, was to make a film version of the play in co-production with [[Victor Saville]] for [[United Artists]].<ref>' BEN-HUR' TO RACE FOR 213 MINUTES: Film Will Be Third Longest Shown \u2013 Small and Saville Planning 'Dear Spy' By RICHARD NASON.

''The Mousetrap'' opened in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1952, and has been running continuously since then. The [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running West End show]], it has by far the longest initial run of any play in history, with its 25,000th performance taking place on 18 November 2012.<ref name=\"telegraph18nov12\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/9686732/Agatha-Christies-The-Mousetrap-celebrates-its-60th-anniversary-with-star-studded-show.html | title=Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap celebrates its 60th anniversary with star-studded show | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=18 Nov 2012 | accessdate=November 19, 2012 | author=Marsden, Sam | location=London}}</ref> The play has a [[Plot twist|twist ending]], which the audience are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the theatre.\n\n==History==\nThe play began life as a short [[Radio drama|radio play]] written as a birthday present for [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], the consort of [[George V|King George&nbsp;V]]. It was broadcast on 30 May 1947 under the name ''[[Three Blind Mice (radio play and short story)|Three Blind Mice]]''. The story drew from the real-life case of [[Dennis O'Neill case|Dennis O'Neill]], who died after he and his brother Terence suffered extreme abuse while in the [[foster care]] of a [[Shropshire]] farmer and his wife in 1945.\n\nThe play is based on a [[short story]], itself based on the radio play, but Christie asked that the story not be published as long as it ran as a play in the [[West End of London]]. The short story has still not been published within the United Kingdom but it has appeared in the United States in the 1950 collection ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]''.\n\nWhen she wrote the play, Christie gave the rights to her grandson Mathew Prichard as a birthday present. In the United Kingdom, only one production of the play in addition to the West End production can be performed annually,<ref>Haining, Peter. ''Agatha Christie \u2013 Murder in Four Acts''. (Page 23). Virgin Books, 1990. {{ISBN|1-85227-273-2}}</ref> and under the contract terms of the play, no [[film adaptation]] can be produced until the West End production has been closed for at least six months.\n\nThe play had to be renamed at the insistence of [[Emile Littler]] who had produced a play called ''Three Blind Mice'' in the West End before the [[Second World War]].<ref>Saunders, Peter. ''The Mousetrap Man''. (Page 118) Collins, 1972. {{ISBN|0-00-211538-7}}</ref> The suggestion to call it ''The Mousetrap'' came from Christie's son-in-law, Anthony Hicks.<ref>[[Janet Morgan, Lady Balfour of Burleigh|Morgan, Janet]]. ''Agatha Christie, A Biography''. (Page 291) Collins, 1984 {{ISBN|0-00-216330-6}}.</ref> In Shakespeare's play ''[[Hamlet]]'', \"The Mousetrap\" is Hamlet's answer to Claudius's inquiry about the name of the play whose prologue and first scene the court has just observed (III, ii). The play is actually ''The Murder of Gonzago'', but Hamlet answers metaphorically, since \"the play's the thing\" in which he intends to \"catch the conscience of the king.\" ''Three Blind Mice'' or its tune is heard a few times during the play.\n\nThe play's longevity has ensured its popularity with tourists from around the world. In 1997, at the initiative of producer [[Stephen Waley-Cohen]], the theatrical education charity Mousetrap Theatre Projects was launched, helping young people experience London's theatre.<ref name=MTP>[http://www.mousetrap.org.uk/index.php/about-us/history.html \"Mousetrap Theatre Projects \u2013 History\"], ''Mousetrap Theatre Projects'', March 15, 2012.

It was originally directed by [[Peter Cotes]], elder brother of [[John and Roy Boulting]], the film directors. Its pre-West End tour then took it to the [[New Theatre Oxford]], the [[Manchester Opera House]], the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]], the [[Theatre Royal, Newcastle]], the [[Grand Theatre Leeds]] and the [[New Alexandra Theatre|Alexandra Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]] before it began its run in [[London]] on 25 November 1952 at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]]. It ran at this theatre until Saturday, 23 March 1974 when it immediately transferred to the larger [[St Martin's Theatre]], next door, where it reopened on Monday, 25 March thus keeping its \"initial run\" status. The London run has now exceeded 26,000 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-mousetrap.co.uk |title=Mousetrap website |publisher=The-mousetrap.co.uk |accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref>  The director of the play for many years has been David Turner.\n\nChristie herself did not expect ''The Mousetrap'' to run for such a long time.  In her autobiography, she reports a conversation that she had with [[Peter Saunders (theatre)|Peter Saunders]]: \"Fourteen months I am going to give it\", says Saunders.  To which Christie replies, \"It won't run that long.  Eight months perhaps.  Yes, I think eight months.\"<ref name=Pendergast2004 /> When it broke the record for the longest run of a play in the West End in September 1957, Christie received a mildly grudging [[telegram]] from fellow playwright [[No\u00ebl Coward]]: \"Much as it pains me I really must congratulate you&nbsp;...\" In 2011 (by which time ''The Mousetrap'' had been running for almost 59 years) this long-lost document was found by a [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]] furniture maker who was renovating a bureau purchased by a client from the Christie estate.<ref>''Antiques Trade Gazette'', Issue 2003, 20 August 2001, page 14. Found with the telegram was a [[lingerie]] bill from 1952 for \u00a324.13s. 6d.</ref>\n\nThe original [[West End theatre|West End]] cast included [[Richard Attenborough]] as Detective Sergeant Trotter and his wife [[Sheila Sim]] as Mollie Ralston. They took a 10% profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary (\"It proved to be the wisest business decision I've ever made&nbsp;... but foolishly I sold some of my share to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called 'The Little Elephant' and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' afloat.\")<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; page 180; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-09-950304-0}}</ref>\n\nSince the retirement of [[Mysie Monte]] and [[David Raven (actor)|David Raven]], who each made history by remaining in the cast for more than 11 years, in their roles as Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf, the cast has been changed annually. The change usually occurs around late November around the anniversary of the play's opening, and was the initiative of Sir Peter Saunders, the original producer. There is a tradition of the retiring [[leading lady]] and the new leading lady cutting a \"Mousetrap cake\" together.\n\nThe play has also made theatrical history by having an original \"cast member\" survive all the cast changes since its opening night. The late [[Deryck Guyler]] can still be heard, via a recording, reading the radio news bulletin in the play to this present day. The set was changed in 1965 and 1999, but one prop survives from the original opening \u2013 the clock which sits on the mantelpiece of the fireplace in the main hall.\n[[File:Mousetrap 22461.JPG|thumb|22,461st performance (St Martin's Theatre \u2013 November 2006)]]\nNotable milestones in the play's history include:\n* 6 October 1952 \u2013 First performance at the [[Theatre Royal, Nottingham]]\n* 22 April 1955 \u2013 1,000th performance\n* 13 September 1957 \u2013 Longest-ever run of a \"straight\" play in the West End\n* 12 April 1958 \u2013 Longest-ever run of a show in the West End with 2,239 performances (the previous holder was ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'')\n* 9 December 1964 \u2013 5,000th performance\n* 17 December 1976 \u2013 10,000th performance\n* 16 December 2000 \u2013 20,000th performance\n* 25 November 2002 \u2013 50th anniversary; a special performance was attended by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"telegraph18nov12\" />\n* 18 November 2012 \u2013 25,000th performance\n\nIn May 2001 (during the London production's 49th year, and to mark the 25th anniversary of Christie's death) the cast gave a semi-staged Sunday performance at the [[Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea]] as a guest contribution to the ''Agatha Christie Theatre Festival 2001'', a twelve-week history-making cycle of all of Agatha Christie's plays presented by [[Roy Marsden]]'s  New Palace Theatre Company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=61377 |title=PR Newswire report of event |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=January 2001 |accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nA staging at the [[Toronto Truck Theatre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], that opened on 19 August 1977 became Canada's longest running show, before finally closing on 18 January 2004 after a run of twenty-six years and over 9,000 performances.\n\nOn 18 November 2012, both the 25,000th performance and the 60th year of the production were marked by a special charity performance which featured [[Hugh Bonneville]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Julie Walters]] and [[Miranda Hart]].

''The Mousetrap and Other Plays''. Signet, 2000. {{ISBN|0-451-20114-0}}</ref>\n\n===Act I===\nAct I opens with the murder of a woman named Maureen Lyon, played out in sound only. The action then moves to Monkswell Manor, recently converted to a guesthouse and run by a young couple, Mollie and Giles Ralston.  While waiting for the guests to arrive, Mollie listens to a radio report about the Lyon murder, which notes that police are looking for a man in a dark overcoat, observed near the scene.\n\nTheir four guests arrive. Christopher Wren is an unkempt, flighty young man. Giles reacts strongly to Wren with instant dislike and Mollie with instinctual trust. Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf then arrive together in a taxi from the station. Mrs Boyle complains about many things; Metcalf is an amiable ex-military man.  Miss Casewell, a mannish young woman, is the last of the booked guests to arrive, before an unexpected fifth party appears. Identifying himself in a foreign accent as Mr Paravicini, he tells the Ralstons his car has overturned in a snowdrift. He remarks that the snow has blocked the roads and that the denizens of the house are trapped. Uneasy about Paravicini's manner, Mollie nevertheless places him in the last remaining room.\n\nThe next afternoon the guest house proves to be snowed in, and the residents are restless. Mollie answers the telephone to Superintendent Hogben of the Berkshire Police. Hogben tells her that he is dispatching Sergeant Trotter to the guest house, and that the Ralstons must listen carefully to what Trotter has to tell them. The Ralstons wonder what they could have done to garner police attention.\n\nTrotter appears at the door on a pair of skis and Major Metcalf discovers that the phone has stopped working.\n\nTrotter explains he has been sent in regard to the murder of Maureen Lyon. In a story loosely based on the real [[Dennis O'Neill case]], the dead woman and her husband had mistreated their three foster children, resulting in the death of the youngest. Both adults were imprisoned for their actions; the husband died in gaol, while the wife served her sentence and had been released, only to be found strangled. Police suspect the elder boy of the abused children, who would now be twenty-two, of being the killer.\n\nTrotter reveals that a notebook found at the murder scene contained the address of Monkswell Manor and the words \"Three Blind Mice\". A note reading \"This is the First\" was pinned to the woman's body. The police have sent Trotter to find out how the Ralstons' guesthouse is connected to the murder and whether the residents are in danger. Both Giles and Mollie deny a connection to the case, though Mollie is ill at ease answering Trotter's questions and quickly excuses herself. Trotter asks each of the guests to explain why they are at Monkswell Manor and any connection they have to the foster children. All five guests deny any personal knowledge of the case.\n\nWhile Trotter and Giles tour the house, Major Metcalf confronts Mrs Boyle, revealing that she was one of the magistrates who had assigned the children to the foster parents. Mrs Boyle acknowledges this but denies that she has any responsibility for what eventually happened to the children there.\n\nAs the evening wears on, Giles and Mollie become suspicious of each other while the guests snipe at one another. Sergeant Trotter traces the phone wire to find out if it has been cut. Mrs Boyle wanders back into the now-empty room and listens to the radio. The opening notes of \"Three Blind Mice\" are heard whistled by an unknown party and Mrs Boyle responds without alarm, speaking to the person only she can see. Suddenly, the lights go out and a scuffle is heard. Moments later, Mollie walks into the room and turns on the lights, only to find Mrs Boyle dead on the floor.\n\n===Act II===\nTen minutes after Mollie finds Mrs Boyle dead of strangulation, Sergeant Trotter takes charge of the household. All the remaining residents are gathered in one room as he attempts to sort out the events of the evening. A shaken Mollie Ralston cannot provide him with any useful clues; the only thing she is sure she observed was the radio blaring. Frustrated, Trotter points out that their lives continue to be in danger; a third murder could very well happen, given the notes left with Maureen Lyon. He insists that everyone tell him where they were when Mrs Boyle was murdered. As each person recounts his or her whereabouts, Trotter takes them to account for inconsistencies or weaknesses in their stories. Finally, he declares that everyone in the house had the opportunity to commit the murder, since each of them was alone at the time. Giles counters that while seven people in the house lack alibis, only one fits the description of the man the police suspect to be the murderer: Christopher Wren. Wren insists that it is all a [[frame-up]], and Trotter acknowledges that he lacks any evidence pointing to Wren in particular.\n\nMollie later pulls Trotter aside; Trotter says that while the police suspect the elder boy to be the killer, the dead boy also had relatives and loved ones who might be interested in revenge: the children's father, an army sergeant, for example; or the dead boy's sister, who would now be a young woman. Trotter notes that Metcalf or Paravicini could be the father, Miss Casewell or Mollie could be the sister, and Giles could be the elder boy. Mollie, aghast, objects to the notion that either she or Giles could be a murderer, but Trotter forces her to admit that they know little about each other's pasts.\n\nMollie soon finds herself in conversation with Christopher Wren, who confesses that he is actually an army deserter hiding from his past under a false name. Mollie acknowledges that she, too, is running away from her past. Despite the trust Christopher and Mollie are forming, he and Giles each suspect the other and nearly come to blows over Mollie. The situation is only defused by the arrival of Paravicini, who tells the company that Trotter's skis are missing.\n\nTrotter again calls an assembly of the household, declaring that he now intends to check the alibis everyone provided to him after Mrs Boyle's murder. They will re-enact the murder, with each member of the household acting out another's alibi. Trotter's hope is that while most of the alibis will be verified, one will be proved impossible. Each person is to go to his or her assigned position and stay there until summoned back by Trotter. The household obediently disperses, leaving Trotter alone onstage.\n\n=== Identity of the murderer ===\n<!-- If you're about to add a \"spoiler alert\" or delete this section, you should be aware that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and does NOT use spoiler warnings.

See [[WP:SPOILER]] for more information on the Wikipedia guideline regarding this, and the [[Talk:The_Mousetrap/FAQ]] (Frequently Asked Questions) at the talk page for a detailed rationale. -->\nAfter the role-players scatter, Trotter sits for a moment before calling for Mollie. He tells her that she has risked extreme danger by not identifying herself to him; he now knows that she was once the schoolteacher of the doomed Corrigan children. She failed to answer a letter the younger boy sent her at the time, begging to be rescued from the farm. Mollie protests that she had been seriously ill when the letter arrived and was unable to even read it until well after the boy was dead. To this day, she says, she is haunted by her failure to help the children out of their circumstances.\n\nTrotter takes a gun out of his pocket and points it at Mollie, telling her that though she assumed he was a policeman, she only believed that because he had rung up beforehand, playing the role of his own superintendent. Trotter is, in fact, Georgie, the elder Corrigan brother, and he intends to take his revenge on Mollie. Falling back into the demeanour of a wounded child who never grew up, he drops his gun and begins to strangle her, but is stopped by the sudden appearance of Miss Casewell. Casewell calls him by name and reveals that she is Kathy, his long-lost sister, come to take him somewhere safe. Major Metcalf, who accompanied Miss Casewell into the room, summons Giles and tells the frightened innkeepers that he had known all along that Trotter was not a policeman \u2013 because Metcalf himself is a policeman, having arranged to switch places with the real Major Metcalf after discovering the \"Three Blind Mice\" notebook on Maureen Lyon.<ref name=\"Mousetrap\" /><!-- As with the articles on Christie's novels, the ending is of important, encyclopaedic relevance for anyone researching the play.

''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' commented that it was \"a middling piece\" with \"less in it than meets the eye&nbsp;... Coincidence is stretched unreasonably.\" The critic commented that the characters were \"built entirely of clich\u00e9s\".<ref>\"'The Mousetrap': New Comedy-Thriller by Agatha Christie\", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 27 November 1952, p. 3</ref> The reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' was more favourably disposed to the characters, calling them \"nicely assorted, individually labelled and readily identified\", and found the plot \"elaborately skilful.\"<ref>\"Ambassadors Theatre\", ''The Times'', 26 November 1952, p. 12</ref> In ''[[The Daily Express]]'' John Barber praised \"the atmosphere of shuddering suspense\" but thought some of the characters \"too obvious by half\".<ref>Barber, John. \"Who Instead of How\", ''The Daily Express'', 26 November 1952, p. 3</ref> In ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', [[J. C. Trewin]] commented that those who failed to spot the killer would probably call the plot \"preposterous and over-burdened\", but those who succeeded might be more kindly disposed.<ref>Trewin, J. C. \"The World of the Theatre \u2013 The Plots Thicken\", ''The Illustrated London News'', 20 December 1952, p. 1044</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nThe play was published as a paperback by [[Samuel French Ltd]] as ''French's Acting Edition No. 153'' in 1954 and is still in print. It was first published in hardback in ''[[The Mousetrap and Other Plays]]'' by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in 1978 ({{ISBN|0-396-07631-9}}).\n\n==Film versions==\nIn 1959 it was announced that [[Edward Small]], who had produced ''Witness for the Prosecution'' for the screen, was to make a film version of the play in co-production with [[Victor Saville]] for [[United Artists]].<ref>' BEN-HUR' TO RACE FOR 213 MINUTES: Film Will Be Third Longest Shown \u2013 Small and Saville Planning 'Dear Spy' By RICHARD NASON.

Her mother worked for [[Philippe Curtius]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, who was a physician skilled in wax modeling. Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modelling beginning when she was a child. He moved to Paris and took his young apprentice, then only 6 years old, with him.<ref name=denton>{{cite web|url=https://thelegendsoflondon.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/the-baker-street-bazaar/|title=The Baker Street Bazaar|date=26 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nGrosholtz created her first [[wax sculpture]] in 1777 of [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Du Plessis |first=Amelia |title=England\u2014Madame Tussauds] |url=http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |publisher=Informational site about England |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213062041/http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |archivedate=13 December 2011}}</ref> At the age of 17, she became the art tutor to Madame Elizabeth, the sister of King [[Louis XVI]] of France, at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. During the [[French Revolution]], she was imprisoned for three months and awaiting execution, but was released after the intervention of an influential friend.<ref name=denton/> Other famous people whom she modelled included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

For the next 33 years she travelled around Europe with a touring show from the collection. She married Francois Tussaud in 1795 and took his surname. She renamed her show as Madame Tussaud's. In 1802, she accepted an invitation from [[Paul Philidor]], a [[lantern]] and [[phantasmagoria]] pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nShe was unable to return to France because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], so she traveled throughout [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] exhibiting her collection. From 1831, she took a series of short leases on the upper floor of \"Baker Street Bazaar\" (on the west side of [[Baker Street]], Dorset Street, and King Street).<ref>Pilbeam (2006) pp. 102\u2013106</ref> This site was later featured in the [[Druce-Portland case]] sequence of trials of 1898\u20131907.

Other famous people were added, including [[Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome sculptures still exist that were made by Marie Tussaud herself. The gallery originally contained some 400 different figures, but fire damage in 1925, coupled with [[The Blitz|German bombs in 1941]], severely damaged most of such older models. The casts themselves have survived, allowing the historical waxworks to be remade, and these can be seen in the museum's history exhibit. The oldest figure on display is that of [[Madame du Barry]], the work of Curtius from 1765 and part of the waxworks left to Grosholtz at his death. Other faces from the time of Tussaud include [[Robespierre]] and [[George III of England|George III]]. In 1842, she made a [[self-portrait]], which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. She died in her sleep on 16 April 1850.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Bernard Tussaud befejezi Lady Alice Scott \u00e9s a Gloucesteri herceg viasszobr\u00e1t \u2013 London, 1935.10.16.tif|thumb|left|200px|Bernard Tussaud finishes the wax figure of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Scott]] and the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 1935.10.16]]\n\nBy 1883, the restricted space and rising cost of the Baker Street site prompted her grandson Joseph Randall to commission construction of a building at the museum's current location on [[Marylebone Road]].

Until 2010 it incorporated the [[London Planetarium]] in its west wing. A large animated [[dark ride]], ''The Spirit of London'', opened in 1993. Today's wax figures at Tussauds include historical and royal figures, film stars, sports stars, and famous murderers. It has been known since 2007 as \"Madame Tussauds\" museums (no apostrophe).\n\nIn July 2008, Madame Tussauds' Berlin branch became embroiled in controversy when a 41-year-old German man brushed past two guards and decapitated a wax figure depicting [[Adolf Hitler]]. This was believed to be an act of protest against showing the ruthless dictator alongside sports heroes, movie stars, and other historical figures.

Her mother worked for [[Philippe Curtius]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, who was a physician skilled in wax modeling. Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modelling beginning when she was a child. He moved to Paris and took his young apprentice, then only 6 years old, with him.<ref name=denton>{{cite web|url=https://thelegendsoflondon.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/the-baker-street-bazaar/|title=The Baker Street Bazaar|date=26 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nGrosholtz created her first [[wax sculpture]] in 1777 of [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Du Plessis |first=Amelia |title=England\u2014Madame Tussauds] |url=http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |publisher=Informational site about England |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213062041/http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |archivedate=13 December 2011}}</ref> At the age of 17, she became the art tutor to Madame Elizabeth, the sister of King [[Louis XVI]] of France, at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. During the [[French Revolution]], she was imprisoned for three months and awaiting execution, but was released after the intervention of an influential friend.<ref name=denton/> Other famous people whom she modelled included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

For the next 33 years she travelled around Europe with a touring show from the collection. She married Francois Tussaud in 1795 and took his surname. She renamed her show as Madame Tussaud's. In 1802, she accepted an invitation from [[Paul Philidor]], a [[lantern]] and [[phantasmagoria]] pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nShe was unable to return to France because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], so she traveled throughout [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] exhibiting her collection. From 1831, she took a series of short leases on the upper floor of \"Baker Street Bazaar\" (on the west side of [[Baker Street]], Dorset Street, and King Street).<ref>Pilbeam (2006) pp. 102\u2013106</ref> This site was later featured in the [[Druce-Portland case]] sequence of trials of 1898\u20131907.

Madame Tussauds.com.</ref> One of the main attractions of her museum was the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]]. The name is often credited to a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1845, but Tussaud appears to have originated it herself, using it in advertising as early as 1843.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Berridge\n|first=Kate...But now British actress Emma Watson is already to set and appear here...\n|title=Madame Tussaud: A life in wax\n|location=New York\n|publisher=HarperCollins\n|year=2006\n|isbn=978-0-06-052847-8\n|url=https://archive.org/details/madametussaud00kate\n}}</ref>\n\nThis part of the exhibition included victims of the French Revolution and newly created figures of murderers and other criminals. Other famous people were added, including [[Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome sculptures still exist that were made by Marie Tussaud herself. The gallery originally contained some 400 different figures, but fire damage in 1925, coupled with [[The Blitz|German bombs in 1941]], severely damaged most of such older models. The casts themselves have survived, allowing the historical waxworks to be remade, and these can be seen in the museum's history exhibit. The oldest figure on display is that of [[Madame du Barry]], the work of Curtius from 1765 and part of the waxworks left to Grosholtz at his death. Other faces from the time of Tussaud include [[Robespierre]] and [[George III of England|George III]]. In 1842, she made a [[self-portrait]], which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. She died in her sleep on 16 April 1850.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Bernard Tussaud befejezi Lady Alice Scott \u00e9s a Gloucesteri herceg viasszobr\u00e1t \u2013 London, 1935.10.16.tif|thumb|left|200px|Bernard Tussaud finishes the wax figure of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Scott]] and the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 1935.10.16]]\n\nBy 1883, the restricted space and rising cost of the Baker Street site prompted her grandson Joseph Randall to commission construction of a building at the museum's current location on [[Marylebone Road]]. The new exhibition galleries were opened on 14 July 1884 and were a great success.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. pp. 166, 168\u20139.</ref> But Randall had bought out his cousin Louisa's half share in the business in 1881, and that plus the building costs resulted in his having too little capital. He formed a limited company in 1888 to attract fresh capital but it had to be dissolved after disagreements between the family shareholders. In February 1889 Tussaud's was sold to a group of businessmen, led by Edwin Josiah Poyser.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. p. 170.</ref>\n\nThe first wax sculpture of a young [[Winston Churchill]] was made in 1908; a total of ten have been made since.<ref>Pamela Pilbeam ''Madame Tussaud: And the History of Waxworks''.

Until 2010 it incorporated the [[London Planetarium]] in its west wing. A large animated [[dark ride]], ''The Spirit of London'', opened in 1993. Today's wax figures at Tussauds include historical and royal figures, film stars, sports stars, and famous murderers. It has been known since 2007 as \"Madame Tussauds\" museums (no apostrophe).\n\nIn July 2008, Madame Tussauds' Berlin branch became embroiled in controversy when a 41-year-old German man brushed past two guards and decapitated a wax figure depicting [[Adolf Hitler]]. This was believed to be an act of protest against showing the ruthless dictator alongside sports heroes, movie stars, and other historical figures. The statue has since been repaired, and the perpetrator has admitted that he attacked the statue to win a bet.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |title       = Adolf Hitler returns to Berlin museum after beheading\n |publisher   = meeja.com.au\n |date        = 14 September 2008\n |accessdate  = 14 September 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919112006/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |archivedate = 19 September 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The original model of Hitler was unveiled in Madame Tussauds London in April 1933; it was frequently vandalised and a 1936 replacement had to be carefully guarded.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. p. 199.</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|title = Madame Tussauds to repair beheaded Hitler\n|agency = Associated Press\n|date = 7 July 2008\n|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25540602\n|accessdate = 7 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man rips head from Hitler wax figure |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN0547926220080705?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews |agency=[[Reuters]] |first=Paul |last=Carrel |date=5 July 2008}}</ref> In January 2016, the statue of Adolf Hitler was removed from the London museum in response to an open letter sent by a staff writer of ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', followed by significant support for its removal from social media.<ref name=jjmadameremoved>{{cite news|last1=Gur-Arieh|first1=Noga|title=Madame Tussauds Museum in London Removed Hitler Figure|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israelife/item/madame_tussauds_museum_in_london_removed_hitler_figure|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|date=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first Madame Tussauds in India opened in New Delhi on 1 December 2017.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967).

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH. New York Times (October 6, 1966: 1.</ref> Reports put his fee around this time at $100,000 a movie.

New York Times ] October 29, 1966: 1.</ref>)\n\nHamilton then made a science fiction movie for [[George Pal]] at MGM, ''[[The Power (1968 film)|The Power]]'' (1968).\n\n===Television===\nGeorge went into television in 1969, supporting [[Lana Turner]] in the all-star ABC series ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]'' (1969\u201370).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-survivors/cast/204719/|title=The Survivors (1969) Cast| website=TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the show was canceled in January 1970, George went into ''[[Paris 7000]]'' (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.
