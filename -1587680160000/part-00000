The second and more important part of the festival was performed at Bantama, which also was the last burial ground of the [[Asante Empire|Asante]] kings, and was known as the \u201cnotorious Bantama ritual\" as the sacrifices involved were of large proportions. When the festival was announced, by beating of drums, people went into hiding for fear that they may be selected for the human sacrifice. As part of the ritual, sheep sacrifice was also involved. Whether human sacrifice was involved or not is a subject of debate, but the fact is that the African societies considered these rites as a \"reunion between the living and the dead.\"{{Sfn|Agorsah|2010|pp=42-43}}\n\n==Traditions==\nThe Adae Kese Festival follows the same rituals as the Adae Festival, however, a difference in the celebration rites is that the chief carries a sheep for sacrifice to the [[Golden Stool|Stool]].{{Sfn|Roy|2005|p=2}} The purification ceremony of [[Odwira festival|Odwira]] is celebrated during Adae Kese at the burial shrines of ancestral spirits. Generally, this coincides with the harvest season of [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and hence the ritual was also called the ''Yam custom'' by Europeans.{{Sfn|Roy|2005|p=2}} It is celebrated at this season to thank the gods and the ancestors for a good harvest.

Green was aware of the challenges posed by the setting up and running of a hospital as he was a life governor of the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]].

This meant that most of the patients in the hospital were long term patients who had tuberculosis (TB) or related respiratory illnesses.

In 1933 the hospital opened a new wing, this increased bed numbers but more notable was that the new wing had operating theatres, this allowed surgical treatment of chest diseases to occur on site. In 1945 the x-ray machinery was upgraded, this boosted the hospitals diagnostic repertoire. Upon the nationwide introduction of the [[National Health Service]] in 1948, the hospital name was officially changed to Forster Green Hospital. A new [[thoracic surgery]] unit was approved for development in 1953 and was finished and operational in 1955, this increased number of surgeries than could be performed in the hospital. Three years later in 1958 a newly built administration unit was opened, this helped better organise the daily workings of the hospital- this building was acquired by the Belfast Trust [[Dietetics]] Service in 2008. Also in 1958 laboratory services were added to the site along with a mortuary, the mortuary was taken over by the Belfast Trust in 1973 and became the Belfast City Mortuary, this was relocated to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast|Royal Victoria Hospital]] in the 2008 to a new forensic mortuary building costing \u00a34.5 million.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/weekend/why-i-owe-my-career-to-sherlock-holmes-28448510.html|title=Why I owe my career to Sherlock Holmes|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-14|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nA change of direction in the hospital's history occurred in 1983 with the closure of the respiratory medicine wards with these wards being moved to the recently opened [[Belfast City Hospital]] tower block along with the radiology department.

Green was aware of the challenges posed by the setting up and running of a hospital as he was a life governor of the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]]. At the time one of the only treatments for tuberculosis was access to fresh air,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/564540.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} HEALTH {{!}} TB: The sandbag and fresh air cure|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref> this was one of the reasons why the Fortbreda site, with its location at the time being outside the city in relative countryside, was a perfect location for a consumption unit.  Over the subsequent two years the site was developed and on 30 September 1897 Forster Green Hospital for Consumption and Chest Diseases opened.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Forster Green Hospital: caring over the century|last=Wallace|first=Duncan|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=|location=Belfast|pages=6\u20139, 36, 41\u201342, 55, 67\u201368, 74\u201379, 86, 97, 119\u2013121}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years the main purpose of the hospital was to function as a [[sanatorium]]. This meant that most of the patients in the hospital were long term patients who had tuberculosis (TB) or related respiratory illnesses. Before the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s the main methods used to treat TB were; exposure to fresh air, rest and surgery to remove infected parts of the lung- this was seen as a last effort to control the disease.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Odell|first=John A.|date=August 2012|title=The history of surgery for pulmonary tuberculosis|journal=Thoracic Surgery Clinics|volume=22|issue=3|pages=257\u2013269|doi=10.1016/j.thorsurg.2012.05.003|issn=1558-5069|pmid=22789591}}</ref> The large amount of open space on the Forster Green site, and the fact it was located outside of the city centre meant that it was the ideal location for the desired non-interventional treatment options.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOver the next 20 years, the hospital steadily grew in size and in 1925 the first x-ray machine was acquired for the hospital- this was used for the diagnosis of thoracic disease and also to help guide treatment. In 1933 the hospital opened a new wing, this increased bed numbers but more notable was that the new wing had operating theatres, this allowed surgical treatment of chest diseases to occur on site. In 1945 the x-ray machinery was upgraded, this boosted the hospitals diagnostic repertoire. Upon the nationwide introduction of the [[National Health Service]] in 1948, the hospital name was officially changed to Forster Green Hospital. A new [[thoracic surgery]] unit was approved for development in 1953 and was finished and operational in 1955, this increased number of surgeries than could be performed in the hospital. Three years later in 1958 a newly built administration unit was opened, this helped better organise the daily workings of the hospital- this building was acquired by the Belfast Trust [[Dietetics]] Service in 2008. Also in 1958 laboratory services were added to the site along with a mortuary, the mortuary was taken over by the Belfast Trust in 1973 and became the Belfast City Mortuary, this was relocated to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast|Royal Victoria Hospital]] in the 2008 to a new forensic mortuary building costing \u00a34.5 million.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/weekend/why-i-owe-my-career-to-sherlock-holmes-28448510.html|title=Why I owe my career to Sherlock Holmes|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-14|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nA change of direction in the hospital's history occurred in 1983 with the closure of the respiratory medicine wards with these wards being moved to the recently opened [[Belfast City Hospital]] tower block along with the radiology department. The thoracic surgery unit was also closed this year and relocated to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast|Royal Victoria Hospital.]] Upon the closure of wards specific to the care of older people in [[Belvoir Park Hospital]], [[Musgrave Park Hospital]] and Ulster Hospital, new facilities for care of older people was opened in the hospital in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Geriatric medicine: the anatomy of change|first1=I C |last1=Taylor|first2=J G |last2=McConnell|date= 2 August 1994|journal=Ulster Medical Journal|pmc=2448767|pmid=8650829|volume=63|issue=2|pages = 162\u20139}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 a specialist rehabilitation unit was opened in the hospital, this unit dealt exclusively with patients with serious brain injuries.
