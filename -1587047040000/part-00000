Escalating budget cutbacks for NASA, however, brought the number of future lunar missions into question. After the [[Cancelled Apollo missions|cancellation]] of Apollo 15 in its original H class profile and Apollo 19 in September 1970, pressure from the scientific community to shift [[Harrison Schmitt]], the sole professional geologist in the active Apollo roster of astronauts, to the crew of Apollo 17, the final scheduled Apollo mission, mounted. In August 1971, NASA named Schmitt as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 17, which meant the original LM pilot [[Joe Engle]] never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; given the choice of flying with Schmitt as LMP or seeing his entire crew removed from Apollo 17, Cernan chose to fly with Schmitt. Cernan eventually came to have a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities; he concluded that Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot while Engle\u2014notwithstanding his outstanding record as an aircraft test pilot\u2014was merely an adequate one.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html |website=NASA |title=Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal |section=A Running Start - Apollo 17 up to Powered Descent Initiation |date=June 10, 2014 |access-date=June 19, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712014734/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html |archivedate=July 12, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nCernan's role as commander of Apollo 17 closed out the Apollo program's lunar exploration mission with a number of record-setting achievements.

In August 1971, NASA named Schmitt as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 17, which meant the original LM pilot [[Joe Engle]] never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; given the choice of flying with Schmitt as LMP or seeing his entire crew removed from Apollo 17, Cernan chose to fly with Schmitt.

Because of its great strategic importance, it featured prominently in the [[Roman-Persian Wars|Roman-Persian conflicts]] (in [[Battle of Dara|530]], 540, 544, [[Siege of Dara (573)|573]], and 604). The former archbishopric remains a multiple Catholic [[titular see]]. Today the [[Turkey|Turkish]] village of O\u011fuz, [[Mardin Province]], occupies its location.\n\n== History ==\n=== Foundation by Anastasius ===\nDuring the [[Anastasian War]] in 502\u2013506, the Roman armies fared badly against the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. According to the ''Syriac Chronicle'' of [[Zacharias Rhetor|Zacharias of Mytilene]], the Roman generals blamed their difficulties on the lack of a strong base in the area, as opposed to the Persians, who held the great city of [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] (which until its cession in 363 had served the same purpose for the Romans).<ref name=Syriac>Zacharias of Mytilene, ''Syriac Chronicle'', Book VII, Chapter VI</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 505, while the Persian King [[Kavadh I]] was distracted in the East, Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] decided to rebuild the village of Dara, only 18&nbsp;kilometres westwards from [[Nisibis]] and just 5&nbsp;km from the actual border with Persia, to be \"a refuge for the army in which they might rest, and for the preparation of weapons, and to guard the country of the Arabs from the inroads of the Persians and [[Saracens]]\".<ref name=Syriac/> Masons and workers from all over Mesopotamia were gathered and worked with great haste. The new city was built on three hills, on the highest of which stood the citadel, and endowed with great storehouses, a public bath and water [[cistern]]s.<ref name=Syriac/> It took the name ''Anastasiopolis'' ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}}) and became the seat of the Roman ''[[dux Mesopotamiae]]''.\n\n=== Reconstruction by Justinian ===\n[[File:Dara P1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Remains of the cisterns]]\nAccording to [[Procopius]], the hasty construction of the original walls resulted in poor quality, and the severe weather conditions of the region exacerbated the problem, ruining some sections. Thus [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] was compelled to undertake extensive repairs to the city, afterwards renaming it ''Iustiniana Nova''.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.1.11-13</ref> The walls were rebuilt and the inner wall raised by a new storey, doubling its height to about {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}}. The towers were strengthened and raised to three stories (ca. 35&nbsp;m) high, and a moat dug out and filled with water.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.1.14-21</ref>\n\nJustinian's engineers also diverted the nearby river [[Cordes (river)|Cordes]] towards the city by digging a canal. The river now flowed through the city, ensuring ample water supply. At the same time, by means of diverting its flow to an underground channel which exited {{convert|65|km|abbr=on}} to the north, the garrison was able to deny water to a besieging enemy, a fact which saved the city on several occasions.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.2</ref> To avert the danger of flooding, which had already once wrecked large parts of the city, [[Dara Dam|an elaborate arch dam]] was built to contain it,<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.3.16-21</ref> one of the earliest known of its kind.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|pp=54f.}}; {{harnvb|Schnitter|1987a|p=13}}; {{harnvb|Schnitter|1987b|p=80}}; {{harnvb|Hodge|1992|p=92}}; {{harnvb|Hodge|2000|p=332, fn. 2}}</ref> In addition, barracks were built for the garrison, and  two new churches were constructed, the \"Great Church\", and one dedicated to [[St Bartholomew]].<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.3.26</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\nThe city was later [[Siege of Dara (573)|besieged and captured]] by the Persians under [[Khosrau I]] in 573-574, but was returned to the Romans by [[Khosrau II]] after the Roman-Persian treaty in 590. It was taken again by Khosrau II in 604-05 after a nine-month siege, recovered again for the Roman Empire by [[Heraclius]]. Finally captured in 639 by the Arab Muslims, the city then lost its military significance, declined and was eventually abandoned.\n\n=== Modern history ===\nDara became the site of massacre during the [[Armenian Genocide]]. According to some reports, the cisterns were filled with the bodies of slaughtered Armenians from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]], [[Mardin]], and [[Erzurum]] in the spring and summer of 1915.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Armenian Genocide: a Complete History|last = Kevorkian|first = Raymond|publisher = I.B.

His successor, Thomas, was deposed in 519 for his opposition to the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and died in 540. Mamas was removed in 537. Stephanus took part in the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553.\n \nAfter the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|7th-century Arab conquest]], Dara again became the seat of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] (Syriac Orthodox) bishops.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 997-998, and 1427-1430</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

Because of its great strategic importance, it featured prominently in the [[Roman-Persian Wars|Roman-Persian conflicts]] (in [[Battle of Dara|530]], 540, 544, [[Siege of Dara (573)|573]], and 604). The former archbishopric remains a multiple Catholic [[titular see]]. Today the [[Turkey|Turkish]] village of O\u011fuz, [[Mardin Province]], occupies its location.\n\n== History ==\n=== Foundation by Anastasius ===\nDuring the [[Anastasian War]] in 502\u2013506, the Roman armies fared badly against the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. According to the ''Syriac Chronicle'' of [[Zacharias Rhetor|Zacharias of Mytilene]], the Roman generals blamed their difficulties on the lack of a strong base in the area, as opposed to the Persians, who held the great city of [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] (which until its cession in 363 had served the same purpose for the Romans).<ref name=Syriac>Zacharias of Mytilene, ''Syriac Chronicle'', Book VII, Chapter VI</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 505, while the Persian King [[Kavadh I]] was distracted in the East, Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] decided to rebuild the village of Dara, only 18&nbsp;kilometres westwards from [[Nisibis]] and just 5&nbsp;km from the actual border with Persia, to be \"a refuge for the army in which they might rest, and for the preparation of weapons, and to guard the country of the Arabs from the inroads of the Persians and [[Saracens]]\".<ref name=Syriac/> Masons and workers from all over Mesopotamia were gathered and worked with great haste. The new city was built on three hills, on the highest of which stood the citadel, and endowed with great storehouses, a public bath and water [[cistern]]s.<ref name=Syriac/> It took the name ''Anastasiopolis'' ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}}) and became the seat of the Roman ''[[dux Mesopotamiae]]''.\n\n=== Reconstruction by Justinian ===\n[[File:Dara P1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Remains of the cisterns]]\nAccording to [[Procopius]], the hasty construction of the original walls resulted in poor quality, and the severe weather conditions of the region exacerbated the problem, ruining some sections. Thus [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] was compelled to undertake extensive repairs to the city, afterwards renaming it ''Iustiniana Nova''.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.1.11-13</ref> The walls were rebuilt and the inner wall raised by a new storey, doubling its height to about {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}}. The towers were strengthened and raised to three stories (ca. 35&nbsp;m) high, and a moat dug out and filled with water.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.1.14-21</ref>\n\nJustinian's engineers also diverted the nearby river [[Cordes (river)|Cordes]] towards the city by digging a canal. The river now flowed through the city, ensuring ample water supply. At the same time, by means of diverting its flow to an underground channel which exited {{convert|65|km|abbr=on}} to the north, the garrison was able to deny water to a besieging enemy, a fact which saved the city on several occasions.<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.2</ref> To avert the danger of flooding, which had already once wrecked large parts of the city, [[Dara Dam|an elaborate arch dam]] was built to contain it,<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.3.16-21</ref> one of the earliest known of its kind.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|pp=54f.}}; {{harnvb|Schnitter|1987a|p=13}}; {{harnvb|Schnitter|1987b|p=80}}; {{harnvb|Hodge|1992|p=92}}; {{harnvb|Hodge|2000|p=332, fn. 2}}</ref> In addition, barracks were built for the garrison, and  two new churches were constructed, the \"Great Church\", and one dedicated to [[St Bartholomew]].<ref>Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', II.3.26</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\nThe city was later [[Siege of Dara (573)|besieged and captured]] by the Persians under [[Khosrau I]] in 573-574, but was returned to the Romans by [[Khosrau II]] after the Roman-Persian treaty in 590. It was taken again by Khosrau II in 604-05 after a nine-month siege, recovered again for the Roman Empire by [[Heraclius]]. Finally captured in 639 by the Arab Muslims, the city then lost its military significance, declined and was eventually abandoned.\n\n=== Modern history ===\nDara became the site of massacre during the [[Armenian Genocide]]. According to some reports, the cisterns were filled with the bodies of slaughtered Armenians from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]], [[Mardin]], and [[Erzurum]] in the spring and summer of 1915.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Armenian Genocide: a Complete History|last = Kevorkian|first = Raymond|publisher = I.B.

His successor, Thomas, was deposed in 519 for his opposition to the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and died in 540. Mamas was removed in 537. Stephanus took part in the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553.\n \nAfter the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|7th-century Arab conquest]], Dara again became the seat of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] (Syriac Orthodox) bishops.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 997-998, and 1427-1430</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

He also served briefly as NASA Acting Administrator in early 2005, covering the period between the departure of [[Sean O'Keefe]] and the swearing in of [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nFrederick Gregory was born on January 7, 1941, in [[Washington, D.C.]].  His father was Francis A. Gregory, an educator who was assistant superintendent for D.C. Public Schools as well as the first black president of the D.C. Public Library Board of Trustees. His father has a public library named after him in the Ward 7/Hillcrest neighborhood. His mother was Nora Drew Gregory, a lifelong educator as well as public library advocate. She was also the sister of noted African-American physician, surgeon and researcher [[Dr. Charles Drew]], who developed improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge in developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II, saving thousands of Allied lives. Gregory's great-grandfather was educator [[James Monroe Gregory]].<ref>Gubert, Betty Kaplan, Miriam Sawyer, and Caroline M. Fannin. Distinguished African Americans in aviation and space science. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. p143</ref>\n\nGregory was raised in Washington, D.C. and graduated from Anacostia High School. He attended the [[United States Air Force Academy]] after being nominated by [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]]; there, he received his Air Force commission and an undergraduate degree in military engineering.\n\n==Military career==\nAfter graduating from the Air Force Academy, Gregory earned his wings after helicopter school, flew in Vietnam, transitioned to fighter aircraft, attended the Navy Test Pilot School, and then conducted testing as an engineering test pilot for both the Air Force and NASA. He also received a master's degree in [[information systems]] from [[George Washington University]].\n\nDuring his time in the Air Force, Gregory logged approximately 7,000 hours in more than 50 types of aircraft as a helicopter, fighter and test pilot. He flew 550 combat rescue missions in Vietnam.\n\n==NASA career==\n[[File:Astronaut candidates Ronald McNair, Guion Bluford, and Frederick Gregory.jpg|thumb|Astronaut candidates [[Ron McNair]], [[Guy Bluford]], and Fred Gregory wearing Apollo spacesuits, May 1978]]\n[[File:Ronald McNair, Guion Bluford, and Fred Gregory (S79-36529, restoration).jpg|thumb|[[Ronald McNair]], [[Guy Bluford]] and Fred Gregory from the class of 1978 were the first three African Americans to go to space.]] \nGregory was selected as an astronaut in January 1978. His technical assignments included: Astronaut Office representative at the Kennedy Space Center during initial Orbiter checkout and launch support for [[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]]; Flight Data File Manager; lead spacecraft communicator ([[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]]); Chief, Operational Safety, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.; Chief, Astronaut Training; and a member of the Orbiter Configuration Control Board and the Space Shuttle Program Control Board. Notably, he was one of the [[Capsule Communicator|CAPCOM]] during the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]].  A veteran of three Shuttle missions he has logged about 456 hours in space. He served as pilot on [[STS-51B]] (April 29 to May 6, 1985), and was the spacecraft commander on [[STS-33]] (November 22\u201327, 1989), and [[STS-44]] (November 24 to December 1, 1991).\n\n===STS-51B===\n{{main|STS-51B}}\n[[STS-51B]]/Spacelab-3 launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, on April 29, 1985 with Gregory serving as pilot. The crew aboard the Orbiter ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' included spacecraft commander, [[Robert Overmyer]]; mission specialists, [[Norman Thagard]], [[William E. Thornton]], and [[Don Lind]]; and payload specialists, [[Taylor Wang]] and [[Lodewijk van den Berg]]. On this second flight of the laboratory developed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the crew conducted a broad range of scientific experiments ranging from space physics to the suitability of animal-holding facilities. The crew also deployed the [[Northern Utah Satellite]] (NUSAT). After seven days of around-the-clock scientific operations, ''Challenger'' and its laboratory cargo landed on the dry lakebed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, on May 6, 1985. Mission duration was 168 hours, 8 minutes, 47seconds.\n\n===STS-33===\n{{main|STS-33}}\nWhen [[STS-33]] launched at night, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989, Gregory became the first [[African-American]] to command a space flight.[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Diversity_in_Space.html] On board the Orbiter ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', Gregory's crew included the pilot, [[John Blaha]], and three mission specialists, [[Sonny Carter|Manley (Sonny) Carter]], [[Story Musgrave]], and [[Kathryn Thornton]]. The mission carried [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] payloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a hard surface landing on Runway 04 at Edwards AFB, California. Mission duration was 120 hours, 7 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\n===STS-44===\n{{main|STS-44}}\n[[STS-44]] launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 24, 1991. During 110 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed their prime payload, the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. They worked on a variety of secondary payloads ranging from the [[Military Man in Space]] experiment designed to evaluate the ability of a space borne observer to gather information about ground troops, equipment and facilities, and also participated in extensive studies evaluating medical countermeasures to long duration space flight. The crew aboard the Orbiter ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' included the pilot [[Terence T. Henricks|Tom Henricks]]; three mission specialists, Story Musgrave, [[James S. Voss|Jim Voss]], and [[Mario Runco Jr.]]; and Army payload specialist [[Thomas J. Hennen|Tom Hennen]]. The mission concluded on December 1, 1991, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Mission duration was 166 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds.\n\n===NASA administration===\n[[File:Gregory-f.jpg|thumb|During his time at NASA]]\nGregory served at NASA Headquarters as Associate Administrator for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (1992\u20132001), and was Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight (2001\u20132002). On August 12, 2002 Mr. Gregory was sworn in as NASA Deputy Administrator. In that role, he was responsible to the Administrator for providing overall leadership, planning, and policy direction for the Agency. The Deputy Administrator performs the duties and exercises the powers delegated by the Administrator, assists the Administrator in making final Agency decisions, and acts for the Administrator in his or her absence by performing all necessary functions to govern NASA operations and exercise the powers vested in the Agency by law. The Deputy Administrator articulates the Agency's vision and represents NASA to the Executive Office of the President, Congress, heads of Federal and other appropriate Government agencies, international organizations, and external organizations and communities. From the departure of [[Sean O'Keefe]] on February 20, 2005, to the swearing in of [[Michael D. Griffin]] on April 14, 2005, he was the NASA Acting Administrator. He returned to the post of Deputy Administrator and on September 9, 2005, submitted his resignation. He was replaced on November 29, 2005 by [[Shana Dale]].\n\n==Personal life==\nGregory was married to the former Barbara Archer of Washington, D.C. until her death in 2008. They had two grown children. Frederick, D. Jr., a Civil Servant working in the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (DOD), and a graduate of [[Stanford University]] and the University of Florida.

He also served briefly as NASA Acting Administrator in early 2005, covering the period between the departure of [[Sean O'Keefe]] and the swearing in of [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nFrederick Gregory was born on January 7, 1941, in [[Washington, D.C.]].  His father was Francis A. Gregory, an educator who was assistant superintendent for D.C. Public Schools as well as the first black president of the D.C. Public Library Board of Trustees. His father has a public library named after him in the Ward 7/Hillcrest neighborhood. His mother was Nora Drew Gregory, a lifelong educator as well as public library advocate. She was also the sister of noted African-American physician, surgeon and researcher [[Dr. Charles Drew]], who developed improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge in developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II, saving thousands of Allied lives. Gregory's great-grandfather was educator [[James Monroe Gregory]].<ref>Gubert, Betty Kaplan, Miriam Sawyer, and Caroline M. Fannin. Distinguished African Americans in aviation and space science. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. p143</ref>\n\nGregory was raised in Washington, D.C. and graduated from Anacostia High School. He attended the [[United States Air Force Academy]] after being nominated by [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]]; there, he received his Air Force commission and an undergraduate degree in military engineering. \n==Military career==\nAfter graduating from the Air Force Academy, Gregory earned his wings after helicopter school, flew in Vietnam, transitioned to fighter aircraft, attended the Navy Test Pilot School, and then conducted testing as an engineering test pilot for both the Air Force and NASA. He also received a master's degree in [[information systems]] from [[George Washington University]].\n\nDuring his time in the Air Force, Gregory logged approximately 7,000 hours in more than 50 types of aircraft as a helicopter, fighter and test pilot. He flew 550 combat rescue missions in Vietnam.\n==NASA career==\n[[File:Astronaut candidates Ronald McNair, Guion Bluford, and Frederick Gregory.jpg|thumb|Astronaut candidates [[Ron McNair]], [[Guy Bluford]], and Fred Gregory wearing Apollo spacesuits, May 1978]]\n[[File:Ronald McNair, Guion Bluford, and Fred Gregory (S79-36529, restoration).jpg|thumb|[[Ronald McNair]], [[Guy Bluford]] and Fred Gregory from the class of 1978 were the first three African Americans to go to space.]] \nGregory was selected as an astronaut in January 1978. His technical assignments included: Astronaut Office representative at the Kennedy Space Center during initial Orbiter checkout and launch support for [[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]]; Flight Data File Manager; lead spacecraft communicator ([[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]]); Chief, Operational Safety, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.; Chief, Astronaut Training; and a member of the Orbiter Configuration Control Board and the Space Shuttle Program Control Board. Notably, he was one of the [[Capsule Communicator|CAPCOM]] during the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]].  A veteran of three Shuttle missions he has logged about 456 hours in space. He served as pilot on [[STS-51B]] (April 29 to May 6, 1985), and was the spacecraft commander on [[STS-33]] (November 22\u201327, 1989), and [[STS-44]] (November 24 to December 1, 1991).\n===STS-51B===\n{{main|STS-51B}}\n[[STS-51B]]/Spacelab-3 launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, on April 29, 1985 with Gregory serving as pilot. The crew aboard the Orbiter ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' included spacecraft commander, [[Robert Overmyer]]; mission specialists, [[Norman Thagard]], [[William E. Thornton]], and [[Don Lind]]; and payload specialists, [[Taylor Wang]] and [[Lodewijk van den Berg]]. On this second flight of the laboratory developed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the crew conducted a broad range of scientific experiments ranging from space physics to the suitability of animal-holding facilities. The crew also deployed the [[Northern Utah Satellite]] (NUSAT). After seven days of around-the-clock scientific operations, ''Challenger'' and its laboratory cargo landed on the dry lakebed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, on May 6, 1985. Mission duration was 168 hours, 8 minutes, 47seconds.\n===STS-33===\n{{main|STS-33}}\nWhen [[STS-33]] launched at night, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989, Gregory became the first [[African-American]] to command a space flight.[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Diversity_in_Space.html] On board the Orbiter ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', Gregory\u2019s crew included the pilot, [[John Blaha]], and three mission specialists, [[Sonny Carter|Manley (Sonny) Carter]], [[Story Musgrave]], and [[Kathryn Thornton]]. The mission carried [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] payloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a hard surface landing on Runway 04 at Edwards AFB, California. Mission duration was 120 hours, 7 minutes, 32 seconds.\n===STS-44===\n{{main|STS-44}}\n[[STS-44]] launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 24, 1991. During 110 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed their prime payload, the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. They worked on a variety of secondary payloads ranging from the [[Military Man in Space]] experiment designed to evaluate the ability of a space borne observer to gather information about ground troops, equipment and facilities, and also participated in extensive studies evaluating medical countermeasures to long duration space flight. The crew aboard the Orbiter ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' included the pilot [[Terence T. Henricks|Tom Henricks]]; three mission specialists, Story Musgrave, [[James S. Voss|Jim Voss]], and [[Mario Runco Jr.]]; and Army payload specialist [[Thomas J. Hennen|Tom Hennen]]. The mission concluded on December 1, 1991, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Mission duration was 166 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds.\n===NASA administration===\n[[File:Gregory-f.jpg|thumb|During his time at NASA]]\nGregory served at NASA Headquarters as Associate Administrator for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (1992\u20132001), and was Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight (2001\u20132002). On August 12, 2002 Mr. Gregory was sworn in as NASA Deputy Administrator. In that role, he was responsible to the Administrator for providing overall leadership, planning, and policy direction for the Agency. The Deputy Administrator performs the duties and exercises the powers delegated by the Administrator, assists the Administrator in making final Agency decisions, and acts for the Administrator in his or her absence by performing all necessary functions to govern NASA operations and exercise the powers vested in the Agency by law. The Deputy Administrator articulates the Agency's vision and represents NASA to the Executive Office of the President, Congress, heads of Federal and other appropriate Government agencies, international organizations, and external organizations and communities. From the departure of [[Sean O'Keefe]] on February 20, 2005, to the swearing in of [[Michael D. Griffin]] on April 14, 2005, he was the NASA Acting Administrator. He returned to the post of Deputy Administrator and on September 9, 2005, submitted his resignation. He was replaced on November 29, 2005 by [[Shana Dale]].\n\n==Personal life==\nGregory was married to the former Barbara Archer of Washington, D.C. until her death in 2008. They had two grown children. Frederick, D. Jr., a Civil Servant working in the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (DOD), and a graduate of [[Stanford University]] and the University of Florida. Heather Lynn is a social worker and graduate of [[Sweet Briar College]] and the University of Maryland. He is now married to the former Annette Becke of Washington, D.C. and together they have three children and six grandchildren.

A bombing did indeed happen in Volgodonsk, but only three days later, on 16 September. Chechen militants were blamed for the bombings, but denied responsibility, along with Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]].

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

Originally designed to ease transition for users from other operating systems (such as Microsoft Windows) by allowing a similar desktop layout, the KDE Plasma Desktop incorporates widget-centric modularity that allows the user to incorporate function similar to all other operating systems and also create new functionality not found in other operating system desktops. Desktop effects are integrated in the standard [[KWin]] installation, and enabled by default.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== History ==\n\nKubuntu was born on 10 December 2004 at the Ubuntu Mataro Conference in Matar\u00f3, Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MataroConference |title=Kubuntu Birthdate |publisher=Ubuntu |date= |accessdate=2004-12-10}}</ref>  Canonical employee Andreas Mueller, from Gnoppix, had the idea to make an Ubuntu KDE variant and got the approval from Mark Shuttleworth to start the first Ubuntu variant, called Kubuntu. On the same evening Chris Halls from the Openoffice project and Jonathan Riddell from KDE started volunteering on the newborn project.\n\n[[Mark Shuttleworth]], in an interview shortly after Ubuntu (which now uses [[GNOME]], previously having used the [[Unity (user interface)|Unity desktop environment]], before then [[GNOME]]) was started, stated:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/181465/ |title=Mark Shuttleworth on the future of Kubuntu |publisher=Lwn.net |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=I believe that the KDE community does phenomenal work, and having a community-driven distribution to showcase that work will help attract users and developers to the project. Our overall goal in the Ubuntu project is to further the adoption of free software on the desktop and the server, and we recognise that KDE is an essential part of the mix of desktop environments that allows people to find the best environment for their needs.}}\n\nThe Kubuntu team released the first edition, Hoary Hedgehog, on {{Start date|df=yes|2005|04|08}}.\n\n[[K Desktop Environment 3]] was used as default interface until Kubuntu 8.04.

They had qualified for the [[1970\u201371 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1970\u201371 Fairs Cup]] after finishing the [[1969\u201370 in English football#First Division|1969\u201370 First Division]] in 4th, but were banned from entering the competition due to financial irregularities. The 1970s saw Derby County's peak in English football and they qualified for Europe in three of the next four seasons, competing in the [[UEFA Cup]] or the [[European Cup]] in each of the three seasons between [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] and [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]].\n\nThe club then declined rapidly and has not appeared in the top European competitions since, though it finished in 5th in the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1989 First Division]] which would have guaranteed entry into the [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup]] but English clubs were banned from Europe following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]].\n\nOutside of major competition, the club won the [[Texaco Cup]] in [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]], and also competed in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] between [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] and [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], reaching the final in 1993, losing 3\u20131 to [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1971\u201372 Texaco Cup===\n[[File:Broomfieldparkairdrie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Broomfield Park]], then home to [[Airdrieonians F.C.

They had qualified for the [[1970\u201371 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1970\u201371 Fairs Cup]] after finishing the [[1969\u201370 in English football#First Division|1969\u201370 First Division]] in 4th, but were banned from entering the competition due to financial irregularities. The 1970s saw Derby County's peak in English football and they qualified for Europe in three of the next four seasons, competing in the [[UEFA Cup]] or the [[European Cup]] in each of the three seasons between [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] and [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]].\n\nThe club then declined rapidly and has not appeared in the top European competitions since, though it finished in 5th in the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1989 First Division]] which would have guaranteed entry into the [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup]] but English clubs were banned from Europe following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]].\n\nOutside of major competition, the club won the [[Texaco Cup]] in [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]], and also competed in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] between [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] and [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], reaching the final in 1993, losing 3\u20131 to [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1971\u201372 Texaco Cup===\n[[File:Broomfieldparkairdrie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Broomfield Park]], then home to [[Airdrieonians F.C.
