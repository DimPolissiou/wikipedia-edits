The infectious agent responsible for the disease is '''rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus''' ('''RHDV'''), or '''rabbit calicivirus''' ('''RCV'''), genus ''[[Lagovirus]]'' of the family [[Caliciviridae]]. The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control rabbit populations.\n\n== RHDV1 and RHDV2 ==\n\nRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a single strand RNA virus in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae. In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=P. J. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Holmes |first3=E.

RHDV1 (sometimes referred to simply as RHDV, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV1 in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nRHDV2 first appeared in France in 2010, from which it spread to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, and Australia. This strain affects multiple lagomorph species, including ''Sylvilagus spp.'' (cottontail rabbits) and ''Lepus spp.'' (hares). It can also cause disease in young rabbits. RHDV2 appears to be replacing the RHDV1 strain in Australia. The 2019 and 2020 outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Washington state and Vancouver were caused by RHDV2. The 2020 outbreak of RHDV2 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is affecting wild cottontails and hares as well as domestic European rabbits; since the virus has now spread into the wild rabbit populations, containment is unlikely.\n\nRHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV1 that the two have different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Both viruses appear to spread via direct contact, fomites, biting insects (mechanical vectors only), and inhalation.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV1 first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]].

By the late 1990s, RHDV1 stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDV1 in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDV1 and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDV1 in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

The infectious agent responsible for the disease is '''rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus''' ('''RHDV'''), or '''rabbit calicivirus''' ('''RCV'''), genus ''[[Lagovirus]]'' of the family [[Caliciviridae]]. The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control rabbit populations.\n\n== RHDV1 and RHDV2 ==\n\nRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a single strand RNA virus in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae.

RHDV1 (sometimes referred to simply as RHDV) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV1 in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nRHDV2 first appeared in France in 2010, from which it spread to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, and Australia. This strain affects multiple lagomorph species, including ''Sylvilagus spp.'' (cottontail rabbits) and ''Lepus spp.'' (hares). It can also cause disease in young rabbits. RHDV2 appears to be replacing the RHDV1 strain in Australia. The 2019 and 2020 outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Washington state and Vancouver were caused by RHDV2. The 2020 outbreak of RHDV2 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is affecting wild cottontails and hares as well as domestic European rabbits; since the virus has now spread into the wild rabbit populations, containment is unlikely.\n\nRHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV1 that the two have different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Both viruses appear to spread via direct contact, fomites, biting insects (mechanical vectors only), and inhalation.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV1 first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]].

The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDV1 and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDV1 in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease.

However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Spain was the worst affected by RHD, which in turn also affected the rabbit-specialized [[Iberian lynx]] and [[Spanish imperial eagle]].<ref name=sd110705>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110705081111.htm | title = Iberian Lynx Depends On Rabbits for Survival | publisher = Science Daily | date = 5 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name=sa110712>{{cite news | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2011/07/12/deadly-rabbit-disease-may-have-doomed-iberian-lynx/ | title = Deadly Rabbit Disease May Have Doomed Iberian Lynx | first = John R. | last = Platt | work = Scientific American | date = 12 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the United Kingdom's first case of RHD in 1992 was discovered, the disease was transmitted into the wild by domesticated pet rabbits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sources vary in the number of confirmed cases of RHD; there were 9 known outbreaks in 1994, 32 cases but some sources believe there were as many as 512 cases of RHD in 1995, and around 30 RHD cases in 1996 throughout Scotland, England and [[Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn April 2016, a highly lethal disease started affecting one of the northernmost feral rabbit populations in the world in [[Helsinki]], Finland. The outbreak has since been identified to be caused by the new RHDV2 strain of the virus, being the first appearance of RHD in the country. Cases of viral transmission to domesticated pet rabbits have been confirmed and vaccinating rabbits has been recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evira.fi/elaimet/elainlaakaripalvelut/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille/2016/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille-elokuu-2016/rhd-tauti-todettu-myos-lemmikkikaniinissa-erityisluvallista-rokotetta-saatavilla/|title=RHD-tauti todettu my\u00f6s lemmikkikaniinissa - erityisluvallista rokotetta saatavilla|website=Finnish Food Safety Authority (Finnish)|access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nTransmission of RHD occurs by direct contact with an infected animal and [[fomite]]s. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.
