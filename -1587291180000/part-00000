His great-grandfather, Henry O'Keefe, practiced medicine in North Dakota from 1890 to 1935. Henry's son, Emmett (James' grandfather), was also a doctor in North Dakota.\n\nO'Keefe met his wife, Joan, while at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. The two married in October 1984 and together they have four children: James III, Evan, Kathleen, and Caroline. Evan started medical school in January 2016.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*DiNicolantonio JJ, Mehta V, O'Keefe. Is Salt a Culprit or an Innocent Bystander in Hypertension?

His great-grandfather, Henry O'Keefe, practiced medicine in North Dakota from 1890 to 1935. Henry's son, Emmett (James' grandfather), was also a doctor in North Dakota.\n\nO'Keefe met his wife, Joan, while at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. The two married in October 1984 and together they have four children: James III, Evan, Kathleen, and Caroline. Evan started medical school in January 2016.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*DiNicolantonio JJ, Mehta V, O'Keefe. Is Salt a Culprit or an Innocent Bystander in Hypertension?

The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.<ref name=\"Rothstein1995\">{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\nIn the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War|a war]] with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>Istvan Szepesi, \"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\" ''Waterloo Historical Review'' 7 (2015).

This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495 by Maximillian I. The Reichskammergericht and the Auclic Council were the two highest judicial instances in the Old Empire. The Imperial Chamber court's composition was determined by both the Holy Roman Emperor and the subject states of the Empire. Within this court, the Emperor appointed the chief justice, always a highborn aristocrat, several divisional chief judges, and some of the other puisne judges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|title=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|website=reichskammergericht.de|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The Aulic Council held standing over many judicial disputes of state, both in concurrence with the Imperial Chamber court and exclusively on their own. The provinces Imperial Chamber Court extended to breaches of the public peace, cases of arbitrary distraint or imprisonment, pleas which concerned the treasury, violations of the Emperor's decrees or the laws passed by the Imperial Diet, disputes about property between [[Imperial Estate|immediate tenants of the Empire]] or the subjects of different rulers, and finally suits against immediate tenants of the Empire, with the exception of criminal charges and matters relating to imperial fiefs, which went to the [[Aulic Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-194658|title=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866\u201329 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions)|website=WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\nThroughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220\u20131254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806.<ref name=\"cantor\"/><ref name=\"BibliothekEhlers2016\">{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd P\u00e4ffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen K\u00f6nigspfalzen.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624\u2013625.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs]]\n* [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]]. 1997.

Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]].

The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.<ref name=\"Rothstein1995\">{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\nIn the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War|a war]] with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>Istvan Szepesi, \"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\" ''Waterloo Historical Review'' 7 (2015).

This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495 by Maximillian I. The Reichskammergericht and the Auclic Council were the two highest judicial instances in the Old Empire. The Imperial Chamber court's composition was determined by both the Holy Roman Emperor and the subject states of the Empire. Within this court, the Emperor appointed the chief justice, always a highborn aristocrat, several divisional chief judges, and some of the other puisne judges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|title=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|website=reichskammergericht.de|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The Aulic Council held standing over many judicial disputes of state, both in concurrence with the Imperial Chamber court and exclusively on their own. The provinces Imperial Chamber Court extended to breaches of the public peace, cases of arbitrary distraint or imprisonment, pleas which concerned the treasury, violations of the Emperor's decrees or the laws passed by the Imperial Diet, disputes about property between [[Imperial Estate|immediate tenants of the Empire]] or the subjects of different rulers, and finally suits against immediate tenants of the Empire, with the exception of criminal charges and matters relating to imperial fiefs, which went to the [[Aulic Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-194658|title=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866\u201329 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions)|website=WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\nThroughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220\u20131254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806.<ref name=\"cantor\"/><ref name=\"BibliothekEhlers2016\">{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd P\u00e4ffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen K\u00f6nigspfalzen.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol.

He built a car named the \"Volksauto\" from the ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear [[Automotive engine|engine]], [[torsion bar suspension]], and a \"beetle\" shape, the front hood rounded for better [[aerodynamic]]s (necessary as it had a small engine).<ref name=SmallWonder>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Walter|title=Small Wonder|year=1967|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|page=333}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VW logo during the 1930s.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|VW logo during the 1930s, initials surrounded by a stylized cogwheel and a spinning propeller that look like a swastika<ref name=Spiegel/>]]\nIn 1934, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, [[Adolf Hitler]] became involved, ordering the production of a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

It was one of the first cars designed with the aid of a [[wind tunnel]]\u2014a method used for German aircraft design since the early 1920s. The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.\n\nThe construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" (modern-day [[Wolfsburg]]), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.<ref name=\"Odin, L.C. 2015\"/> This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939.

In April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the Americans and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] the town and factory fell. The factories were placed under the control of [[Saddleworth]]-born Hirst, by then a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as [[war reparations]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as [[carburetor|carburettors]]) were unavailable. With striking humanity and great engineering and management ingenuity, Hirst and his German assistant [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilize the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his fine engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the [[East Germany|Russian zone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=Lindsay|title=Mr|journal=Thoroughbred & Classic Cars|date=October 1986}}</ref> The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to the [[Bundespost|German Post Office]].

The defeated German staff, he said, were initially sullen and unresponsive, having been conditioned by many years of Nazism and they were sometimes unresponsive to orders.

Apart from the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[commercial vehicle]] (van, pick-up, and camper), and the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|VW Karmann Ghia]] sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a ''Victory Wagon''. [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardize sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen Importer, Colborne Garages of [[Ripley, Surrey]], started with parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.<ref name=uk-import-first/>\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300 engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500 engine, and 1600 in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favor in the United States market with the advent of non-leaded gasoline and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW Production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the USA West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularized on the USA West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\nIn 1969 the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque]]/unibody construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU). The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]]. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dean |first=Wayne |date=28 October 2006 |url=http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |title=History of the Super Beetle |publisher=superbeetles.com |accessdate=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213643/http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]]. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979. The U.S. Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0007, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Volkswagen Type 4]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as of 1973]]\n[[File:1969 Volkswagen 1600 Type 3 Squareback (17081445566).jpg|thumb|right|1969 VW Squareback (Type III)]]\n\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished [[:File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|typ 266]], a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars.

Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/[[Auto Union]] proved beneficial. Its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[water cooling|water-cooled]] engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\nFirst in the series was the [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a [[fastback]] version of the [[Audi 80]], using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\nIn spring 1974, the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] followed. The coupe was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Based on the platform of the not yet released [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], it was built at [[Karmann]] due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Golf had a [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] followed. It was a re-badged [[Audi 50]], which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the [[Volkswagen Derby]], which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a [[Three-box styling|three-box design]] of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the polo classic/polo saloon until 1991.\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n===1974\u20131990: Product line expansion===\n[[File:VW Polo I front 20090810.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo Mk1|Volkswagen Polo]] (1975\u20131979 model)]]\n\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European automakers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen lineup since its introduction,{{when|date=July 2017}} and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the [[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref>  The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.

Other main models during the decade include the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] for the segment above the Golf.\n\nIn 1998 the company launched the new [[Volkswagen Lupo|Lupo]] city car.

The sixth-generation [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|VW Golf]] was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the [[Opel Insignia|Opel/Vauxhall Insignia]] in the 2009 [[European Car of the Year]], and has spawned several cousins: [[Volkswagen Jetta (A6)|VW Jetta]], [[VW Scirocco]], SEAT Le\u00f3n, SEAT Toledo, [[\u0160koda Octavia]] and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-[[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]], the [[SEAT Altea]]. The GTI, a \"[[hot hatch]]\" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]] Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the U.S. and Canada in 2006.\n\nThe sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and Volkswagen announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] by 2008. Other models in [[Wolfgang Bernhard]]'s (Volkswagen brand CEO) \"product offensive\" include the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]] mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a [[Volkswagen Passat Coup\u00e9|Passat Coup\u00e9]]. In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] at the beginning of 2007.\n\n[[File:VW Scirocco III 1.4 TSI DSG Team Deep Black.JPG|thumb|right|The third generation [[Volkswagen Scirocco]]]]\n\nVolkswagen in 2005 maintained North American sales of 224,195. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in [[Curitiba]], where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favorable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's \"[[Car and Driver Ten Best|10 Best]]\" for 2007, [[Automobile Magazine|''Automobile'' Magazine's]] 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n[[File:2013 Volkswagen Golf SE BlueMotion Technology 1.4 Front.jpg|thumb|left|The seventh-generation [[Volkswagen Golf]]]]\n\nVolkswagen partnered with [[Daimler AG]] and other companies to market the [[BlueTec]] [[clean diesel]] technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands.

They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and later the [[Audi Q7]]. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 [[Geneva Auto Show]], and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]].\n\nSince the discontinuance of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 \"City Golf (Golf City in 2009)\" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]]. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n[[File:2006-2010 Volkswagen Passat (3C) sedan (2011-07-17) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Passat]] (3C)]]\n\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant|Chattanooga Assembly]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]. The Chattanooga Assembly plant marked VW's first plant since the plant at New Stanton was closed down. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars and SUVs specifically designed for the North American markets, beginning with the [[Volkswagen Passat NMS|Passat B7]] in 2011.

The first Porsche car, the [[Porsche 64]] of 1938, used many components from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. The 1948 [[Porsche 356]] continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, [[gearbox]] and suspension.\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6]]. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the [[Porsche 912]]-E (the USA only) and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many [[Audi]] components and was built at Audi's [[Neckarsulm]] facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most [[Porsche 944]] models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\nThe [[Porsche Cayenne]], introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in [[Bratislava]] that the other SUV's are built.\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |title=Porsche wants 20% Volkswagen deal &#124; 26 September 2005 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2005 |accessdate=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006040107/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |archive-date=6 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Speculated suitors included [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]].

He built a car named the \"Volksauto\" from the ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear [[Automotive engine|engine]], [[torsion bar suspension]], and a \"beetle\" shape, the front hood rounded for better [[aerodynamic]]s (necessary as it had a small engine).<ref name=SmallWonder>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Walter|title=Small Wonder|year=1967|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|page=333}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VW logo during the 1930s.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|VW logo during the 1930s, initials surrounded by a stylized cogwheel and a spinning propeller that look like a swastika<ref name=Spiegel/>]]\nIn 1934, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, [[Adolf Hitler]] became involved, ordering the production of a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

It was one of the first cars designed with the aid of a [[wind tunnel]]\u2014a method used for German aircraft design since the early 1920s. The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.\n\nThe construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" (modern-day [[Wolfsburg]]), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.<ref name=\"Odin, L.C. 2015\"/> This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939.

In April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the Americans and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] the town and factory fell. The factories were placed under the control of [[Saddleworth]]-born Hirst, by then a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as [[war reparations]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as [[carburetor|carburettors]]) were unavailable. With striking humanity and great engineering and management ingenuity, Hirst and his German assistant [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilize the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his fine engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the [[East Germany|Russian zone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=Lindsay|title=Mr|journal=Thoroughbred & Classic Cars|date=October 1986}}</ref> The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to the [[Bundespost|German Post Office]].

The defeated German staff, he said, were initially sullen and unresponsive, having been conditioned by many years of Nazism and they were sometimes unresponsive to orders. At Nordhoff's suggestion, he sent back to England for his officer's uniform and from then on, had no difficulty in having his instructions followed. Hirst can be seen photographed at Wolfsburg in his uniform, although he was not actually a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government. The title of 'Major' was sometimes used by someone who had left the Army as a courtesy, but Hirst chose not to use the title.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe post-war [[industrial plans for Germany]] set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK |title=Harry S.

Owing to roof and window damage, production had to stop when it rained, and the company had to barter new vehicles for steel for production.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe car and its town changed their Second World War-era names to \"Volkswagen\" and \"[[Wolfsburg]]\" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries. Famously, all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, [[William Edward Rootes, 1st Baron Rootes|Sir William Rootes]], head of the British [[Rootes Group]], told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy ...

In 1949, Major Hirst left the company\u2014now re-formed as a trust controlled by the West German government and government of the State of [[Lower Saxony]]. The \"Beetle\" sedan or \"peoples' car\" Volkswagen is the Type 1. Apart from the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[commercial vehicle]] (van, pick-up, and camper), and the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|VW Karmann Ghia]] sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a ''Victory Wagon''. [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardize sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen Importer, Colborne Garages of [[Ripley, Surrey]], started with parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.<ref name=uk-import-first/>\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

On 17 February 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history. By 1973, total production was over 16 million.\n\nTo commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the \"Baja Champion SE\"<ref>Colin Shinkin [http://www.sebeetles.com/champion.htm About the 1972 Baja Champion SE \u2013 USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428232126/http://www.sebeetles.com/champion.htm |date=28 April 2015 }} (photos).

It featured unique \"Marathon Blau\" metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38&nbsp;cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] fog lights mounted on the front bumper.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1961\u20131973: Beetle to Golf===\n[[File:Volkswagen Type 3.jpg|thumb|left|A 1963 [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW Type 3 Notchback]] ]]\n\nThe 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36&nbsp;hp 1200cc four cylinder air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made of aluminum alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300 engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500 engine, and 1600 in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favor in the United States market with the advent of non-leaded gasoline and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW Production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the USA West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularized on the USA West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\nIn 1969 the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque]]/unibody construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU). The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]]. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dean |first=Wayne |date=28 October 2006 |url=http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |title=History of the Super Beetle |publisher=superbeetles.com |accessdate=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213643/http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]]. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979. The U.S. Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0007, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Volkswagen Type 4]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as of 1973]]\n[[File:1969 Volkswagen 1600 Type 3 Squareback (17081445566).jpg|thumb|right|1969 VW Squareback (Type III)]]\n\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished [[:File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|typ 266]], a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars.

Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/[[Auto Union]] proved beneficial. Its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[water cooling|water-cooled]] engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\nFirst in the series was the [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a [[fastback]] version of the [[Audi 80]], using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\nIn spring 1974, the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] followed. The coupe was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Based on the platform of the not yet released [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], it was built at [[Karmann]] due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Golf had a [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] followed. It was a re-badged [[Audi 50]], which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the [[Volkswagen Derby]], which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a [[Three-box styling|three-box design]] of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the polo classic/polo saloon until 1991.\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n===1974\u20131990: Product line expansion===\n[[File:VW Polo I front 20090810.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo Mk1|Volkswagen Polo]] (1975\u20131979 model)]]\n\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European automakers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen lineup since its introduction,{{when|date=July 2017}} and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the [[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref>  The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.

It was a strong seller in West Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the [[Audi 50]], which was only available in certain markets and was less popular.

In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] at the beginning of 2007.\n\n[[File:VW Scirocco III 1.4 TSI DSG Team Deep Black.JPG|thumb|right|The third generation [[Volkswagen Scirocco]]]]\n\nVolkswagen in 2005 maintained North American sales of 224,195. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in [[Curitiba]], where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favorable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's \"[[Car and Driver Ten Best|10 Best]]\" for 2007, [[Automobile Magazine|''Automobile'' Magazine's]] 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n[[File:2013 Volkswagen Golf SE BlueMotion Technology 1.4 Front.jpg|thumb|left|The seventh-generation [[Volkswagen Golf]]]]\n\nVolkswagen partnered with [[Daimler AG]] and other companies to market the [[BlueTec]] [[clean diesel]] technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available for sale in the United States are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&year1=2012&year2=2013&vfuel=Diesel&mclass=Small+Cars,%20Family+Sedans,%20Large+Sedans,%20Upscale+Sedans,%20Luxury+Sedans,%20Hatchbacks,%20Coupes,%20Convertibles,%20Sports/Sporty+Cars,%20Station+Wagons&srchtyp=newDslCars |title=Fuel Economy of New Diesel Cars |year=2012 |website=Fueleconomy.gov |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=5 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117191226/http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&year1=2012&year2=2013&vfuel=Diesel&mclass=Small+Cars%2C%20Family+Sedans%2C%20Large+Sedans%2C%20Upscale+Sedans%2C%20Luxury+Sedans%2C%20Hatchbacks%2C%20Coupes%2C%20Convertibles%2C%20Sports%2FSporty+Cars%2C%20Station+Wagons&srchtyp=newDslCars |archive-date=17 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI ([[Turbocharged Direct Injection]]) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and later the [[Audi Q7]]. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 [[Geneva Auto Show]], and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]].\n\nSince the discontinuance of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 \"City Golf (Golf City in 2009)\" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]]. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n[[File:2006-2010 Volkswagen Passat (3C) sedan (2011-07-17) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Passat]] (3C)]]\n\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant|Chattanooga Assembly]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]. The Chattanooga Assembly plant marked VW's first plant since the plant at New Stanton was closed down. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars and SUVs specifically designed for the North American markets, beginning with the [[Volkswagen Passat NMS|Passat B7]] in 2011. The company recently announced plans to expand further by investing $900&nbsp;million to add floor space to the factory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/07/volkswagen-expansion-tech-center-chattanooga/|title=Volkswagen plans expansion, tech center in Chattanooga|author=Chris Bruce|date=7 April 2015|work=Autoblog|accessdate=22 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123140/http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/07/volkswagen-expansion-tech-center-chattanooga/|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Volkswagen 1-litre car|VW XL1]] began a limited production run in 2013.

The 1948 [[Porsche 356]] continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, [[gearbox]] and suspension.\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6]]. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the [[Porsche 912]]-E (the USA only) and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many [[Audi]] components and was built at Audi's [[Neckarsulm]] facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most [[Porsche 944]] models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\nThe [[Porsche Cayenne]], introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in [[Bratislava]] that the other SUV's are built.\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |title=Porsche wants 20% Volkswagen deal &#124; 26 September 2005 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2005 |accessdate=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006040107/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |archive-date=6 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Speculated suitors included [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]].

They are usually packaged with a large [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle]] styled as a [[steering wheel]], along with a set of pedals for gas, brake, and sometimes [[clutch]] actuation, as well as various shifter controls. An [[Analog Signal|analog]] wheel and pedal set such as this allows the user to accurately manipulate steering angle and pedal control that is required to properly manage a simulated car, as opposed to digital control such as a keyboard. The relatively large range of motion further allows the user to more accurately apply the controls. Racing wheels have been developed for use with [[arcade game]]s, [[game console]]s, [[personal computer]]s, and also for professional driving simulators for race drivers.\n\n==Force feedback==\nRacing wheels started off as simple plastic wheels hooked up to a rotary potentiometer, which were sprung by springs or bungees. Eventually manufacturers began to use electric motors in the controllers, in place of springs, in order to achieve a level of [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], first seen in Microsoft's Sidewinder wheel. At first this technology simply provided the centering force and other artificial effects such as shaking the wheel in a crash or other vibrations. However, as driving simulations have evolved, their physics engines have become more accurate and the developers have linked their in-game physics more closely to the force feedback. This allows the user to truly feel what forces go through the steering rack, instead of just artificial effects, and genuinely enhance the realism of the game. Despite this, some high end manufacturers believe that force feedback has still not been perfected, and therefore companies such as Thomas SuperWheel have not adopted a force feedback system in their products. Frex, on the other hand, has gone the other way and equips their high-end Simwheel with powerful force feedback and no mechanical centering device. CEO of Fanatec Chase Johnston Explained how a wheel with no Force Feedback is very hard to use.\n\n==Comparison of racing wheels==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

They are usually packaged with a large [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle]] styled as a [[steering wheel]], along with a set of pedals for gas, brake, and sometimes [[clutch]] actuation, as well as various shifter controls. An [[Analog Signal|analog]] wheel and pedal set such as this allows the user to accurately manipulate steering angle and pedal control that is required to properly manage a simulated car, as opposed to digital control such as a keyboard. The relatively large range of motion further allows the user to more accurately apply the controls. Racing wheels have been developed for use with [[arcade game]]s, [[game console]]s, [[personal computer]]s, and also for professional driving simulators for race drivers.\n\n==Force feedback==\nRacing wheels started off as simple plastic wheels hooked up to a rotary potentiometer, which were sprung by springs or bungees. Eventually manufacturers began to use electric motors in the controllers, in place of springs, in order to achieve a level of [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], first seen in Microsoft's Sidewinder wheel. At first this technology simply provided the centering force and other artificial effects such as shaking the wheel in a crash or other vibrations. However, as driving simulations have evolved, their physics engines have become more accurate and the developers have linked their in-game physics more closely to the force feedback. This allows the user to truly feel what forces go through the steering rack, instead of just artificial effects, and genuinely enhance the realism of the game. Despite this, some high end manufacturers believe that force feedback has still not been perfected, and therefore companies such as Thomas SuperWheel have not adopted a force feedback system in their products. Frex, on the other hand, has gone the other way and equips their high-end Simwheel with powerful force feedback and no mechanical centering device.\n\n==Comparison of racing wheels==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

The sides of the ridge slope away from narrow top on either side. The lines along the crest formed by the highest points, with the terrain dropping down on either side, are called the '''ridgelines'''. Ridges are usually termed [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s as well, depending on size.\n\n==Types==\nThere are several main types of ridges:\n* [[Dendritic drainage|Dendritic]] ridge: In typical [[dissected plateau]] terrain, the stream drainage valleys will leave intervening ridges. These are by far the most common ridges. These ridges usually represent slightly more [[erosion]] resistant rock, but not always \u2013 they often remain because there were more [[Joint (geology)|joints]] where the valleys formed or other chance occurrences.  This type of ridge is generally somewhat random in orientation, often changing direction frequently, often with knobs at intervals on the ridge top.\n* Stratigraphic ridge: In places such as the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], long, even, straight ridges are formed because they are the uneroded remaining edges of the more resistant [[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[stratum|strata]] that were [[Fold (geology)|folded]] laterally.  Similar ridges have formed in places such as the [[Black Hills]], where the ridges form concentric circles around the [[igneous]] core.  Sometimes these ridges are called \"[[Hogback (geology)|hogback ridges]]\".\n* [[Mid ocean ridge|Oceanic spreading ridge]]: In [[tectonic]] spreading zones around the world, such as at the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], the volcanic activity forms new land between tectonic boundaries creating volcanic ridges at the spreading zone.  [[Isostasy|Isostatic]] settling and erosion gradually reduces the elevations moving away from the zone.\n* Crater ridges: Large [[meteorite]] strikes typically form large [[impact crater]]s bordered by circular ridges.\n* Volcanic crater/caldera ridges: Large [[volcano]]es often leave behind a central [[volcanic crater|crater]]/[[caldera]] bordered by circular ridges.\n* Fault ridges: [[Fault (geology)|Faults]] often form [[escarpment]]s.  Sometimes the tops of the escarpments form not plateaus but slope back so that the edges of the escarpments form ridges.\n* Dune ridges: In areas of large-scale [[dune]] activity, certain types of dunes result in [[sand]] ridges.\n* Moraines and eskers: [[Glacier|Glacial]] activity may leave ridges in the form of [[moraine]]s and [[esker]]s. An [[ar\u00eate]] is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion.\n* Volcanic subglacial ridges: Many [[subglacial volcano]]es create ridge-like formations when [[lava]] erupts through a thick [[glacier]] or [[ice sheet]].\n* [[Shutter ridge]]s: A shutter ridge is a ridge that has moved along a fault line, blocking or diverting drainage. Typically, a shutter ridge creates a valley corresponding to the alignment of the fault that produces it.\n* [[Pressure ridge (lava)|Pressure ridges]]: Also known as a tumuli, usually develops in lava flows especially when slow-moving lava beneath a solidified crust wells upward. The brittle crust usually buckles to accommodate the inflating core of the flow, thus creating a central crack along the length of the tumulus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/flow_features.html|title=How Volcanoes Work - lava flow features|website=www.geology.sdsu.edu|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> An Ice pressure ridge develops in an ice cover as a result of a stress regime established within the plane of the ice.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commonscat|Ridges}}\n* {{annotated link|Tectonic uplift}}\n* {{annotated link|Mountain range}}\n* {{annotated link|Mountain chain}}\n* {{annotated link|Hill chain}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External Links ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=dXK7AAAAIAAJ Norsk Geologisk Tidsskrift], Volume 69 Universitetsforlaget, 1989, page 40 https://books.google.com/books?id=dXK7AAAAIAAJ\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=dC7qhGQpBYkC Physical Geography: Introduction To Earth], page 164\n\n\n[[Category:Ridges| ]]\n[[Category:Montane ecology]]\n[[Category:Erosion landforms]]\n[[Category:Slope landforms]]\n[[Category:Mountains|Ridges]]\n[[Category:Oronyms]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the geography and geology concept}}\n{{redirect|Ridgeline}}\n{{short description|A geological feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for some distance}}\n{{multiple issues|\n {{refimprove|date=March 2019}}\n {{prose|date=April 2019}}\n {{lead extra info|date=April 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:Tsubakurodake from Otenshodake 2002-8-22.jpg|thumb|A mountain ridge in Japan]]\n[[File:Bristol tenn ridgelines2.jpg|thumb|A stratigraphic ridge within the Appalachian Mountains.]]\n[[File:The Table1.jpg|thumb|The edges of [[tuya]]s can form ridges.]]\n[[File:Vihren Pirin IMG 0859.jpg|thumb|[[Pirin]] Mountain main ridge - view from [[Koncheto]] [[Ar\u00eate|knife-edge ridge]] towards the [[pyramidal peak]]s [[Vihren]] and [[Kutelo]]]]\n\nA '''ridge''' or a '''mountain ridge'''  is a geographical feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for some distance.
