coins,<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> with the largest single chunk them weighing about 7 tonnes.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> The hoard was a breakthrough because never before were any iron cash coins discovered in [[northern China]].<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> Before this hoard, historians believed that iron cash coins were only used in regions where commerce flourished south of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> The archaeologists also found out that the Northern Song iron cash coins at the site had not simply rusted together but displayed clear signs that they had been melted together.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> Furthermore, at the site the archeologists also found some coin moulds and stoves that may suggest that a mint may have been located there in the past.<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> However, some experts refuted this hypothesis because this area was part of a frontier region during the Song dynasty period and the Song government would in all likelihood not have built a coin mint in a remote border area like this.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> Contemporary experts noted that this coin hoard would re-write China's history of coin production.<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> Why such a large quantity of Song dynasty period iron cash coins were buried in the area near Cangzhou and why these iron coins had apparently been melted together in such large chunks remains a mystery.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> According to Ms. Wang Yufang (\u738b\u7389\u82b3), the Director of the [[Cangzhou City Bureau of

name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> The most plausible hypothesis as to why these iron cash coins were located in such large quantities and why they were (partially) melted together claims that iron cash coins were sent to the area by the government of the Song dynasty in order to pay for military expenses contending for control of the [[Sixteen Prefectures]] against the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]].<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/><ref name=\"China-Culture-Journal-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> The Song army was eventually defeated during this campaign.<ref

having to transport such an enormous quantity of iron cash coins during their retreat.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/><ref name=\"China-Culture-Journal-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> Since the transport of the iron cash coins would have been difficult to achieve, and given the fact that it was necessary them to make a hasty retreat, it is hypothesised that a decision was made by the Song army to abandon the huge amounts of money in the area, and that they were partially melted down to prevent the iron cash coinage from falling into the hands of the advancing enemy soldiers.<ref

that receive over 1200 millimeters of rain annually such as Quanzhou.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> This fact is cited to be one of the important reasons as to why no other sites which cast cash coins using clay moulds have been discovered in the modern period this far into [[southern China]].<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Iron was used to cast cash coins by the Min Kingdom in the area because the region where Quanzhou is situated had ample supplies of iron and [[coal]] but lacked any copper reserves.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> As to why such a large quantity of clay moulds were discovered at the Chengtian Temple us because the casting method that was employed by the Min Kingdom at the time required a two-piece clay mould was made with a small hole in which the molten iron, with a temperature of at least 1535[[Degree Celsius|\u00b0C]], could be poured into them.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Once the iron had hardened, forming the cash coin, the clay mould had to be broken apart in order to take the cash coin out.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Each clay mould could was only capable to produce a single cash coin.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Furthermore, the archaeologists noted that while the casting technique for manufacturing cash coins had remained the same as it had in

dated to the Northern Song dynasty period. The discovery was made by a local tourism department of Cangzhou city.<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> The archeologists had initially dug up about 48 tonnes of iron cash coins,<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> with the largest single chunk them weighing about 7 tonnes.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> The hoard was a breakthrough because never before were any iron cash coins discovered in [[northern China]].<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> Before this hoard, historians believed that iron cash coins were only used in regions where commerce flourished south of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> The archaeologists also found out that the Northern Song iron cash coins at the site had not simply rusted together but displayed clear signs that they had been melted together.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> Furthermore, at the site the archeologists also found some coin moulds and stoves that may suggest that a mint may have been located there in the past.<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> However, some experts refuted this hypothesis because this area was part of a frontier region during the Song dynasty period and the Song government would in all likelihood not have built a coin mint in a remote border area like this.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> Contemporary experts noted that this coin hoard would re-write China's history of coin production.<ref name=\"People's-Daily-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> Why such a large quantity of Song dynasty period iron cash coins were buried in the area near Cangzhou and why these iron coins had apparently been melted together in such large chunks remains a mystery.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> According to Ms. Wang Yufang (\u738b\u7389\u82b3), the Director of the [[Cangzhou City Bureau of Cultural Relics]] (\u6ca7\u5dde\u5e02\u6587\u7269\u5c40), there are no historical documents dating to the Song dynasty that mention the existence of this iron cash coin cache.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> The most plausible hypothesis as to why these iron cash coins were located in such large quantities and why they were (partially) melted together claims that iron cash coins were sent to the area by the government of the Song dynasty in order to pay for military expenses contending for control of the [[Sixteen Prefectures]] against the [[Jurchen]]s.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/><ref name=\"China-Culture-Journal-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> The Song army was eventually defeated during this campaign.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/><ref name=\"China-Culture-Journal-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> As they were forced to withdraw from the region, the Song army was faced with the prospect of having to transport such an enormous quantity of iron cash coins during their retreat.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/><ref name=\"China-Culture-Journal-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> Since the transport of the iron cash coins would have been difficult to achieve, and given the fact that it was necessary them to make a hasty retreat, it is hypothesised that a decision was made by the Song army to abandon the huge amounts of money in the area, and that they were partially melted down to prevent the iron cash coinage from falling into the hands of the advancing enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/><ref name=\"China-Culture-Journal-Cangzhou-Tieqian-Hoard\"/> The iron cash coins from the hoard are now displayed at the Tieqian Ku (\u94c1\u94b1\u5e93, \"iron cash coins treasury\") located in the city of Cangzhou.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekCangzhouIronCashCoins\"/> || \n|- \n| In April 2002 archeologists had begun a formal excavation at the [[Chengtian Temple (Quanzhou)|Chengtian Temple]] in [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]], where three decades earlier a number of [[Min Kingdom|Kingdom of Min]] period Yonglong Tongbao (\u6c38\u9686\u901a\u5bf6) clay moulds had been uncovered.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> At a depth of about 3 meters the archeologists had discovered over a thousand clay mould fragments at the location.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> While it known that the Min Kingdom had a mint, its exact location was unknown, but due to the discovery of such a large number of clay mould fragments discovered at the Chengtian Temple confirms that the mint was located somewhere in present-day Quanzhou, making it only known mint location from the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] at the time.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> The archaeologists considered this hoard to be particularly fortunate, as it is rare for such cultural objects made from clay to survive in climates that receive over 1200 millimeters of rain annually such as Quanzhou.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> This fact is cited to be one of the important reasons as to why no other sites which cast cash coins using clay moulds have been discovered in the modern period this far into [[southern China]].<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Iron was used to cast cash coins by the Min Kingdom in the area because the region where Quanzhou is situated had ample supplies of iron and [[coal]] but lacked any copper reserves.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> As to why such a large quantity of clay moulds were discovered at the Chengtian Temple us because the casting method that was employed by the Min Kingdom at the time required a two-piece clay mould was made with a small hole in which the molten iron, with a temperature of at least 1535[[Degree Celsius|\u00b0C]], could be poured into them.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Once the iron had hardened, forming the cash coin, the clay mould had to be broken apart in order to take the cash coin out.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Each clay mould could was only capable to produce a single cash coin.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekChengtianTempleHoard\"/> Furthermore, the archaeologists noted that while the casting technique for manufacturing cash coins had remained the same as it had in ancient times, the casting technology itself had evolved to the point where the Chinese character inscriptions displayed on the coinage could now be clearly cast.<ref

[[Aishwarya Rai]] star in the lead role along with [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Shabana Azmi]], [[Sunil Shetty]], [[Divya Dutta]], [[Himani Shivpuri]] and [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] in supporting roles.The film is directed by [[J. P. Dutta]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1840, a girl named Amiran (Aishwarya Rai) is kidnapped from her home in [[Faizabad]] by Dilawar Khan ([[Vishwajeet Pradhan]]) who had been sent to jail based upon the evidence presented by Amiran's father. To take his revenge, he kidnaps Amiran and sells her to a brothel in [[Lucknow]] run by Khannum Jaan ([[Shabana Azmi]]). Bua Hussaini ([[Himani Shivpuri]]) and Maulvi Sahib ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) adopt Amiran and treat her as their own daughter. In the company of Khurshid ([[Ayesha Jhulka]]), Bismillah ([[Divya Dutta]]), and one of the courtesan's sons, Gauhar Mirza ([[Puru Raaj Kumar]]), Amiran learns the art of being a courtesan, or ''[[tawaif]]''.\n\nThe girl turns into an elegant, poetic beauty by the name of Umrao Jaan ([[Aishwarya Rai]]). Umrao's beauty and poetry are enough to catch the eye of Nawab Sultan ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]). The two begin a passionate romance but, when his father hears of their relationship, he disowns Nawab Sultan from his life, wealth and property. The penniless Nawab goes to stay in the house of his uncle, who is a judge in Ghari, to sort himself out; Umrao is left desolate without him and prays every day for his return.\n\nIn the Nawab's absence, Umrao catches the eye of Faiz Ali ([[Sunil Shetty]]). Though she rejects his romantic advances, he determinedly pursues her and eventually asks her to accompany him to his home in Daulatabad. Umrao accepts, but only after she learns that they will be travelling through Ghari. Along the way, the whole party is arrested after a confrontation between Faiz Ali's men and a group of state soldiers. Faiz Ali is revealed to be a [[dacoit]] whom the soldiers have pursued for years. Nawab Sultan hears that Umrao and Faiz Ali are in Ghari and goes to meet Faiz Ali in prison. Faiz Ali, who then realises that Umrao only accompanied him so that she could meet Nawab, manipulates the information concerning his time with Umrao and implies to the Nawab that they had a sexual relationship. The Nawab confronts Umrao and, feeling that she betrayed him, shuns her and sends her back to Lucknow. Heartbroken, Umrao returns to her old life, but fate has other plans for her.\n\nIn a drunken state, Umrao's childhood friend Gauhar Mirza ([[Puru Raaj Kumar]]), who has always been in love with her, becomes frustrated at her for rejecting his advances and rapes her. Soon after, the British attack the city and she is forced to leave Lucknow. She and the refugees separate after she decides to go to Faizabad, her childhood home. There, she learns that her father is long dead. She meets her mother and brother, but they refuse to accept her because of her profession. Umrao, rejected by her family and her lover, leaves to return to Lucknow. Then, fate plays another joke on her: on her way out of the city, she encounters Dilawar Khan, the man who had kidnapped her and sold her to the brothel when she was a child. Poor, wretched, homeless, injured, and infected with [[leprosy]], he begs Umrao for money, not recognising who she is. She gives him her gold bangles and prays to God for his forgiveness. Ostracized by all and having forgiven those who destroyed her life, Umrao lives out the rest of her days in Lucknow with her poetry and ill fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aishwarya Rai]] as Amiran (Umrao Jaan)\n* [[Abhishek Bachchan]] as Nawab\n* [[Shabana Azmi]] as Khanum Jaan\n* [[Sunil Shetty]] as Faiz Ali\n* [[Divya Dutta]] as Bismillah\n* [[Himani Shivpuri]] as Bua Hussaini\n* [[Puru Raaj Kumar]] as Gauhar Mirza\n* [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] as Maulvi Sahib\n* [[Ayesha Jhulka]] as Khurshid\n* Bikram Saluja as Ashraf (Nawab Sultan's friend)\n* [[Parikshat Sahni]] as Umrao's father\n* Maya Alagh as Umrao's mother\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as Dilawar Khan (Amiran's abductor)\n* [[Javed Khan Amrohi|Javed Khan]] as Peer Baksh (Dilawar Khan's accomplice)\n* Bansree Madhani as Amiran (the young Umrao)\n*Alexandre boisvert as sultan khan\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Dutta the film is based on the script written by his father O.

[[Aishwarya Rai]] star in the lead role along with [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Shabana Azmi]], [[Sunil Shetty]], [[Divya Dutta]], [[Himani Shivpuri]] and [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] in supporting roles.The film is directed by [[J. P. Dutta]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1840, a girl named Amiran (Aishwarya Rai) is kidnapped from her home in [[Faizabad]] by Dilawar Khan ([[Vishwajeet Pradhan]]) who had been sent to jail based upon the evidence presented by Amiran's father. To take his revenge, he kidnaps Amiran and sells her to a brothel in [[Lucknow]] run by Khannum Jaan ([[Shabana Azmi]]). Bua Hussaini ([[Himani Shivpuri]]) and Maulvi Sahib ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) adopt Amiran and treat her as their own daughter. In the company of Khurshid ([[Ayesha Jhulka]]), Bismillah ([[Divya Dutta]]), and one of the courtesan's sons, Gauhar Mirza ([[Puru Raaj Kumar]]), Amiran learns the art of being a courtesan, or ''[[tawaif]]''.\n\nThe girl turns into an elegant, poetic beauty by the name of Umrao Jaan ([[Aishwarya Rai]]). Umrao's beauty and poetry are enough to catch the eye of Nawab Sultan ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]). The two begin a passionate romance but, when his father hears of their relationship, he disowns Nawab Sultan from his life, wealth and property. The penniless Nawab goes to stay in the house of his uncle, who is a judge in Ghari, to sort himself out; Umrao is left desolate without him and prays every day for his return.\n\nIn the Nawab's absence, Umrao catches the eye of Faiz Ali ([[Sunil Shetty]]). Though she rejects his romantic advances, he determinedly pursues her and eventually asks her to accompany him to his home in Daulatabad. Umrao accepts, but only after she learns that they will be travelling through Ghari. Along the way, the whole party is arrested after a confrontation between Faiz Ali's men and a group of state soldiers. Faiz Ali is revealed to be a [[dacoit]] whom the soldiers have pursued for years. Nawab Sultan hears that Umrao and Faiz Ali are in Ghari and goes to meet Faiz Ali in prison. Faiz Ali, who then realises that Umrao only accompanied him so that she could meet Nawab, manipulates the information concerning his time with Umrao and implies to the Nawab that they had a sexual relationship. The Nawab confronts Umrao and, feeling that she betrayed him, shuns her and sends her back to Lucknow. Heartbroken, Umrao returns to her old life, but fate has other plans for her.\n\nIn a drunken state, Umrao's childhood friend Gauhar Mirza ([[Puru Raaj Kumar]]), who has always been in love with her, becomes frustrated at her for rejecting his advances and rapes her. Soon after, the British attack the city and she is forced to leave Lucknow. She and the refugees separate after she decides to go to Faizabad, her childhood home. There, she learns that her father is long dead. She meets her mother and brother, but they refuse to accept her because of her profession. Umrao, rejected by her family and her lover, leaves to return to Lucknow. Then, fate plays another joke on her: on her way out of the city, she encounters Dilawar Khan, the man who had kidnapped her and sold her to the brothel when she was a child. Poor, wretched, homeless, injured, and infected with [[leprosy]], he begs Umrao for money, not recognising who she is. She gives him her gold bangles and prays to God for his forgiveness. Ostracized by all and having forgiven those who destroyed her life, Umrao lives out the rest of her days in Lucknow with her poetry and ill fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aishwarya Rai]] as Amiran (Umrao Jaan)\n* [[Abhishek Bachchan]] as Nawab\n* [[Shabana Azmi]] as Khanum Jaan\n* [[Sunil Shetty]] as Faiz Ali\n* [[Divya Dutta]] as Bismillah\n* [[Himani Shivpuri]] as Bua Hussaini\n* [[Puru Raaj Kumar]] as Gauhar Mirza\n* [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] as Maulvi Sahib\n* [[Ayesha Jhulka]] as Khurshid\n* Bikram Saluja as Ashraf (Nawab Sultan's friend)\n* [[Parikshat Sahni]] as Umrao's father\n* Maya Alagh as Umrao's mother\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as Dilawar Khan (Amiran's abductor)\n* [[Javed Khan Amrohi|Javed Khan]] as Peer Baksh (Dilawar Khan's accomplice)\n* Bansree Madhani as Amiran (the young Umrao)\n*Alexandre boisvert as sultan khan\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Dutta the film is based on the script written by his father O.

[[Priyanka Chopra]] was considered to play the part of Umrao Jaan, but could not allot the ninety consecutive dates required for shooting due to her role in ''[[Bluffmaster]]''. [[Arshad Warsi]] was to star in the film as Gauhar Mirza, but dropped out soon after as he chose to appear in ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]''. Puru Raajkumar replaced Warsi. [[Shabana Azmi]], who plays the role of Khannum Jaan, is the daughter of Shaukat Azmi, who played the same role in the 1981 version.[[Saif Ali Khan]] was approached for Nawab Sultan's role in the film along with [[Akshaye Khanna]] in Faiz Ali's role but both declined the film due to other projects so [[Abhishek Bachchan]] replaced [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Sunil Shetty]] replaced [[Akshaye Khanna]] .\n\n==Music==\nThe music is by [[Anu Malik]] and the lyrics by [[Javed Akhtar]].

He was founding-member of the German artist groups ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' and [[Junge Wilde]], which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \n\nDokoupil lives and works between [[Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Prag, Berlin and [[Las Palmas]].\n\n==Biography==\nJi\u0159\u00ed Dokoupil was born in [[Krnov]], then [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1954. After the invasion of the Soviet army in Prague in 1968, he escaped with his family over Austria to Germany. In 1976 he began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Cologne]]. Later on he also attended classes at the Universities of Frankfurt and the [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied among others under German concept artist [[Hans Haacke]]. The influence of Haacke is evident in Dokoupil\u2018s early work. From 1983\u201384 Dokoupil was guest professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and 1989 in [[Madrid]].\n\nIn 1979 Dokoupil founded the group ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' with artists such as Hans Peter Adamski, Peter B\u00f6mmels and Walter Dahn. The group was associated with the art dealer Paul Maenz who organised Dokoupil\u2018s first solo exhibition in 1982. In their shared studio in Cologne on a street named M\u00fclheimer Freiheit, the six [[Junge Wilde|Jungen Wilden]]  sought to explore a contemporary expression for their art by using a [[neoexpressionism|neoexpressive]], figurative style of intensely colourful painting with traditional subjects and by overriding the intellectual, reduced formal language of [[Minimalism|Minimal]] and [[Conceptual Art]]. \"I\u2019d come to realize that the conceptual artists had become liars,\" Dokoupil has said. \"What they had promised us was salvation, art without form. But I\u2019d go into a gallery and there would be nothing to see, and it would be for a lot of money \u2013 that just couldn\u2019t be it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2012/dokoupil/|title=Dokoupil|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=032c}}</ref>   \n\nBut already in an early stage Dokoupil developed a less wild, rather unusual method of working and soon found his own radical subjective way with individual considerations. With his \"book painting\" shown at [[Documenta]] 7, [[Kassel]], in 1982, Dokoupil attracted the attention of the art world. It was a gigantic material painting called ''God, show me your balls'', a kind of homage to a [[Julian Schnabel]] plate painting, (which were made of broken ceramic dishes collaged into an image). Schnabel was not invited to participate in the exhibition \u2013 in Dokoupil\u2018s eyes a serious effront. Since then \u2013 besides the early group exhibitions with the ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' \u2013 Dokoupil's work has been seen in numerous one-man shows in galleries, museums and at other cultural sites worldwide.\n\n==Works==\nIn accordance with the thesis of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]], Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define  his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles.

The ''Soot Paintings'', often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the ''Subastas''- series, of 1989 or recent ones called ''Leopards''(2000\u20132009) or \"Christ\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his ''Tire paintings'' of 1991\u20131992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his ''Soap Bubble Paintings'' of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates ''Whip Paintings'' by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil\u2018s most recent work is the series of spray-painted ''Buddhas'' on canvas. They are meant to be like [[Buddha]], [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] and [[Mona Lisa]] all at once, since [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]]\u2018s Marilyn is the Mona Lisa of the 20th century.\n\nEven though a retrospective of his oeuvre would resemble a group show of different painters, it has nothing to do with any pluralism of styles, with the claim of the coincidence of styles, or with a variety of [[post-irony|post-modern irony]]. The focus of his multifaceted oeuvre is in fact on exploring original techniques and configurations generating a domain for playful experimentation and physical tension in which new images can arise and assuring that the act of making images is independent of the iconographic compulsions of the media world today. In that sense Dokoupil could be seen as an \"artist inventor\": inventor of styles and techniques ultimately a clearly conceptual approach.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nSelected Exhibitions:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*Prague Castle Riding School, Praha, 2010\n*Galerie [[Bruno Bischofberger]] and Galerie Andrea Caratsch, Z\u00fcrich, 2009\n*Ben Brown Fine Arts, London, 2008\n*[[Deichtorhallen]], Hamburg, 2005\n*[[National Gallery in Prague|National Gallery, Praha]], 2005\n*Haus der Kunst, Brno (Czech republic), 2005\n*Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno CAAM, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 2003\n*Kestner Gesellschaft, Hannover, 2002\n*[[Centraal Museum]], Utrecht, 2002\n*Milton Keynes Gallery, Central Milton Keynes, 2002\n*[[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid, 2002\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]], Chenonceaux, 1999\n*Museum Weimar, Weimar, 1997\n*[[MUMOK|Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig]], Wien, 1997\n*Centre d'Art Contemporain de Fr\u00e9jus, Fr\u00e9jus, 1996\n*[[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery, New York, 1994\n*Sala Am\u00e1rica, Diputaci\u00f3n Foral de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1993\n*Galer\u00eda Juana de Aizpuru, Madrid, 1992\n*Horsens Kunstmuseum, Lund, 1991\n*Kunsthalle Kiel, Kiel, 1991\n*Robert Miller Gallery, New York, 1990\n*Fundaci\u00f3n Caja de Pensiones, Madrid, 1989\n{{col-3}}\n*Galerie Bruno Bischofberger, Z\u00fcrich, 1987\n*Ileana Sonnabend Gallery, New York, 1986\n*[[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, New York, 1985\n*[[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, 1984\n*Kunstmuseum Luzern, Luzern, 1984\n*[[Groninger Museum]], Groningen, 1984\n*Espace Lyonnais d'Art Contemporain, Lyon, 1984\n*Gallery [[Mary Boone]], New York, 1983\n*Galerie Paul Maenz, K\u00f6ln, 1982\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Collections==\n\nSelected Collections:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven\n* [[Neue Galerie - Sammlung Ludwig]], Aachen\n* [[Groninger Museum]], Groningen\n* Sonnabend Collection, New York\n* [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]\n* Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam\n* [[Kunsthaus Zurich]]\n* Metzger Collection, Museum Folkwang, Essen\n* Neue Galerie, Berlin\n{{col-3}}\n* Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation, Basel\n* Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund\n* Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt\n* The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul\n* Caixa de Pensiones, Barcelona\n* [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris\n* [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid\n* Museo de Bellas Artes de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz\n* Kunstmuseum Horsens, Denmark\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]\n* Kunsthalle zu Kiel\n* Paul Maenz Collection, Neues Museum Weimer\n* Bischofberger Collection, Zurich\n* [[Migros Museum]], Zurich\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 General Collection, Paris\n* Rubell Family Collection, Miami\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Films==\n\nHe acted in and co produced a few early films of [[Daryush Shokof]] amongst which [[dogs are not allowed]], and [[Ben Hur ,the Breathless,Taxi Driver in Casablanca]] and [[Flushers]] in 2013 in Berlin, Germany.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of German painters]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | editors=Wilfried Dickhoff, Robert Fleck | title=Dokoupil - Painting in the 21st Century | location=Hamburg | publisher=DUMONT | year=2005}} {{ISBN|3-8321-7553-9}}\n*{{cite book | editors=Carlos Ortega | title=dokoupil | location=Madrid |  publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda | year=2000}} {{ISBN|84-8003-976-0}}\n*{{cite book | editors=P\u00e9rez Esteban, Jos\u00e9 Antonio | title=Cuadros de humo: una constante esencial en la obra de Jiri Georg Dokoupil | location=M\u00fanich|  publisher=Grin| year=2013}} {{ISBN|978-3-656-49637-3}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artist/20138/jiri-georg-dokoupil.html Dokoupil at Artnet]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dokoupil}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Krnov]]\n[[Category:20th-century German painters]]\n[[Category:German male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century German painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Czech painters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:JiriDokoupil.jpg|thumb| Jiri Georg Dokoupil, 2004]]\n'''Ji\u0159\u00ed \"Georg\" Dokoupil''' (born 3 June 1954) is a Czech-German painter and graphic artist. He was founding-member of the German artist groups ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' and [[Junge Wilde]], which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \n\nDokoupil lives and works between [[Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Plovdiv]], in [[Bulgaria]], and [[Las Palmas]], in [[Spain]].\n\n==Biography==\nJi\u0159\u00ed Dokoupil was born in [[Krnov]], then [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1954. After the invasion of the Soviet army in Prague in 1968, he escaped with his family over Austria to Germany. In 1976 he began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Cologne]]. Later on he also attended classes at the Universities of Frankfurt and the [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied among others under German concept artist [[Hans Haacke]]. The influence of Haacke is evident in Dokoupil\u2018s early work. From 1983\u201384 Dokoupil was guest professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and 1989 in [[Madrid]].\n\nIn 1979 Dokoupil founded the group ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' with artists such as Hans Peter Adamski, Peter B\u00f6mmels and Walter Dahn. The group was associated with the art dealer Paul Maenz who organised Dokoupil\u2018s first solo exhibition in 1982. In their shared studio in Cologne on a street named M\u00fclheimer Freiheit, the six [[Junge Wilde|Jungen Wilden]]  sought to explore a contemporary expression for their art by using a [[neoexpressionism|neoexpressive]], figurative style of intensely colourful painting with traditional subjects and by overriding the intellectual, reduced formal language of [[Minimalism|Minimal]] and [[Conceptual Art]]. \"I\u2019d come to realize that the conceptual artists had become liars,\" Dokoupil has said. \"What they had promised us was salvation, art without form. But I\u2019d go into a gallery and there would be nothing to see, and it would be for a lot of money \u2013 that just couldn\u2019t be it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2012/dokoupil/|title=Dokoupil|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=032c}}</ref>   \n\nBut already in an early stage Dokoupil developed a less wild, rather unusual method of working and soon found his own radical subjective way with individual considerations. With his \"book painting\" shown at [[Documenta]] 7, [[Kassel]], in 1982, Dokoupil attracted the attention of the art world. It was a gigantic material painting called ''God, show me your balls'', a kind of homage to a [[Julian Schnabel]] plate painting, (which were made of broken ceramic dishes collaged into an image). Schnabel was not invited to participate in the exhibition \u2013 in Dokoupil\u2018s eyes a serious effront. Since then \u2013 besides the early group exhibitions with the ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' \u2013 Dokoupil's work has been seen in numerous one-man shows in galleries, museums and at other cultural sites worldwide.\n\n==Works==\nIn accordance with the thesis of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]], Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define  his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles. A selection of his series is listed below.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*M\u00fclheimer Freiheit (1980\u20131981)\n*New School of Cologne (1982)\n*Blue Paintings about Love (1982)\n*Documenta Paintings (1982)\n*Theoretical Paintings (1983)\n*Terry Cloth Paintings (1983\u20131984)\n*The Pacifier Paintings (1984)\n*The Apple Maiden (1984)\n{{col-3}}\n*Children Paintings (1983\u20131985)\n*Corporations & Products (1985\u20131986)\n*Madonnas in Ecstasy (1985\u20131987)\n*Esoteric Paintings (1987)\n*Jesus Paintings (1986\u20131987)\n*Soot Paintings (Candle and Torch) (1989-today)\n*Mother's Milk Paintings (1989\u20131991)\n*Tire Paintings (1991\u20131992)\n{{col-3}}\n*Soap Bubble Paintings (1992-today)\n*The Green Paintings (1996)\n*Slavic Paintings (1996\u20131999)\n*Pigment Paintings (1998\u20132002)\n*Whip Paintings (2002\u20132003)\n*Buddha Paintings (2003\u20132004)\n*The Arrugadist Paintings (1999\u20132005)\n*Movie Paintings (2007\u20132009)\n{{col-end}}\n\nSince 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of ''Soot Paintings'', painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling.

Held annually in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], it is a 16- to 18-day [[folk festival]] running from mid or late September to the first Sunday in October, with more than six million people from around the world attending the event every year. Locally, it is called '''''d\u2019Wiesn''''', after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, [[Theresienwiese]]. The Oktoberfest is an important part of [[Bavaria]]n culture, having been held since the year 1810. Other cities across the world also hold [[Oktoberfest celebrations]] that are modeled after the original Munich event.\n\nDuring the event, large quantities of [[Oktoberfest Beer]] are consumed: during the 16-day festival in 2013, for example, {{convert|7.7|e6l|usbeerbbl impgal|lk=on}} were served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oktoberfesttours.travel/2014/10/19/oktoberfest-beer-consumption-2014/|title=Oktoberfest Beer Consumption}}</ref> Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.\n\nThe Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to [[German reunification]]. As such, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival would run until 3 October ([[German Unity Day]]). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Adam Pferderennen Oktoberfest 1823.jpg|thumb|Horse race at the Oktoberfest in Munich, 1823]]\n[[File:Carl Kricheldorf Portrait eines M\u00e4dchens in Tracht.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a girl wearing a ''[[dirndl]]'' dress]]\n''[[Kronprinz]]'' Ludwig (1786\u20131868), later [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|King Ludwig I]] (reign: 1825\u20131848), married Princess [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]] on 12 October 1810. The citizens of [[Munich]] were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the royal event. The fields were named ''Theresienwiese'' (\"Theresa's Meadow\") in honour of the Crown Princess, and have kept that name ever since, although the locals have since abbreviated the name simply to the \"''Wiesn''\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Oktoberfestbier|url=http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Oktoberfestbier.html|publisher=German Beer Institute|access-date=16 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020064254/http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Oktoberfestbier.html|archive-date=20 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Horse races, in the tradition of the 15th-century ''Scharlachrennen'' (Scarlet Race at Karlstor), were held on 18 October to honor the newlyweds.  It is widely understood that Andreas Michael Dall'Armi, a Major in the National Guard, proposed the idea. However, the origins of the horse races, and Oktoberfest itself, may have stemmed from proposals offered by Franz Baumgartner, a coachman and Sergeant in the National Guard. The precise origins of the festival and horse races remain a matter of controversy, however, the decision to repeat the horse races, spectacle, and celebrations in 1811 launched what is now the annual Oktoberfest tradition.\n\nThe fairground, once outside the city, was chosen due to its natural suitability. The Sendlinger Hill (today ''Theresienhohe'') was used as a grandstand for 40,000 race spectators. The festival grounds remained undeveloped except for the king's tent. The tastings of \"Traiteurs\" and other wine and beer took place above the visitors in the stands on the hill. Before the race started, a performance was held in homage of the bridegroom and of the royal family in the form of a train of 16 pairs of children dressed in ''Wittelsbach'' costumes, and costumes from the then nine Bavarian townships and other regions. This was followed by the punishing race with 30 horses on an 11,200-foot (3,400 meters) long racetrack, and concluded with the singing of a student choir. The first horse to cross the finish line belonged to Franz Baumgartner (one of the purported festival initiators). Horse racing champion and Minister of State [[Maximilian von Montgelas]] presented Baumgartner with his gold medal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiesnkini.de/magazin/das-erste-oktoberfest-1810/ | title=Das erste Oktoberfest | author= | date= | website=wiesnkini.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Transformation into a public festival==\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1811, a show was added to promote Bavarian agriculture. In 1813, the festival was canceled due to the involvement of Bavaria in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Oktoberfest grew from year to year. The horse races were accompanied by tree climbing, bowling alleys, and swings and other attractions. In 1818, [[carnival]] booths appeared; the main prizes awarded were of silver, [[porcelain]], and jewelry. The city fathers assumed responsibility for festival management in 1819, and it was decided that Oktoberfest become an annual event. In 1832, the date was moved some weeks later, as a Greek delegation came. It inspired them for the [[Zappas Olympics]] which became in 1896 the modern Olympic Games. Later, the Oktoberfest was lengthened and the date pushed forward because days are longer and warmer at the end of September. The horse race continued until 1960, and the agricultural show still exists today and is held every four years in the southern part of the festival grounds.\n\nTo honour the marriage of [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|Prince Ludwig]] and [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]], a parade took place for the first time in 1810. Since 1850, the parade has become an annual event and an important component of the Oktoberfest. Eight thousand people\u2014mostly from Bavaria\u2014and dressed in traditional costumes walk from Maximilian Street through the centre of Munich to the Oktoberfest grounds. The march is led by the ''[[M\u00fcnchner Kindl]]''.\n\n[[File:Munich Bavaria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bavaria statue]] above the Theresienwiese]]\nSince 1850, the [[Bavaria statue|statue of Bavaria]] has watched over the Oktoberfest. This worldly Bavarian [[patron]] was first sketched by [[Leo von Klenze]] in a classic style and [[Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler]] romanticised and \"[[germanisation|Germanised]]\" the draft. \n{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The statue was constructed by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier and [[Ferdinand von Miller]].\n\nIn 1853, the Bavarian [[Ruhmeshalle (Munich)|''Ruhmeshalle'']] was completed. In 1854, the festival was cancelled after 3,000 residents of Munich including the queen consort died during a [[cholera]] epidemic. There was no Oktoberfest in 1866 because Bavaria was involved in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. In 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] again forced the cancellation of the festival. In 1873, the festival was cancelled due to yet another cholera epidemic. In 1880, electric light illuminated more than 400 booths and tents. In 1881, booths selling ''[[Bratwurst]]'' opened and the first beer was served in glass mugs in 1892.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a re-organization took place. Until then, there were games of [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], large dance floors, and trees for climbing in the beer booths. Organizers wanted more room for guests and musicians which resulted in the booths becoming beer halls which are still used today.\n\nIn 1887, the parade of the Oktoberfest staff and breweries took place for the first time. This event showcases the splendidly decorated horse teams of the breweries and the bands that play in the festival tents. This event always takes place on the first Saturday of the Oktoberfest and serves as the official prelude to the Oktoberfest celebration.\n\n===20th century===\nAt the 100th anniversary of Oktoberfest in 1910, an estimated 120,000 litres of beer were consumed. Three years later, the \"''Br\u00e4urosl''\" was founded, which at that time was the largest pavilion to have ever been built, accommodating approximately 12,000 people.\n\nDue to World War I, Oktoberfest was temporarily suspended from 1914 to 1918. The two years after the war, in 1919 and 1920, Oktoberfest was replaced by the so-called \"''kleineres Herbstfest''\" (which can be translated as \"smaller autumn celebration\"), and in 1923 and 1924 the Oktoberfest was canceled due to hyper-inflation.\n\nDuring [[Nazism|National Socialism]], Oktoberfest was used as part of [[Nazi propaganda]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Seeing Hitler\u2019s Germany: Tourism in the Third Reich|last=Semmens|first=Kristin|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=978-1-349-51958-3|location=Basingstoke|pages=65}}</ref> In 1933, Jews were forbidden to work on the ''Wiesn''. Two years later, Oktoberfest's 125th anniversary was celebrated with all the frills. The main event was a big parade.\n\nThe slogan \"proud city \u2013 cheerful country\" was meant to show the alleged overcoming of differences between social classes, and can be seen as an example of the regime's consolidation of power. In 1938, after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had annexed [[Austria]] and won the [[Sudetenland]] via the [[Munich Agreement]], Oktoberfest was renamed to \"''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Volksfest''\" (Greater German folk festival), and as a showing of strength, the Nazi regime transported people from [[Sudetenland]] to the ''Wiesn'' by the score.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/braune-wiesn-wie-hitler-das-oktoberfest-stahl-a-947923.html | title=Wie Hitler das Oktoberfest stahl| author=Tobias Lill | date=25 September 2008 | website=wiesnkini.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, no Oktoberfest was celebrated. Following the war, from 1946 to 1948, Munich celebrated only the \"Autumn Fest\". The sale of proper Oktoberfest beer\u20142% stronger in [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|gravity]] than normal beer\u2014was not permitted; guests could only drink normal beer.\n\nSince its foundation, there have been 24 years in which Oktoberfest was not celebrated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muenchen-lese.de/index.php?article_id=141 | title=Das M\u00fcnchner Oktoberfest | author=Julia Meyer | date= | website= | publisher=M\u00fcnchen-Lese | language=German | accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1950, the festival has always been opened with the same traditional procedure: At noon, a 12-gun salute is followed by the tapping of the first keg of Oktoberfest beer by the Mayor of Munich with the proclamation \"''O'zapft is!''\" (\"It's tapped!\" in the [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian dialect]]). The Mayor then gives the first litre of beer to the [[List of Minister-Presidents of Bavaria|Minister-President of the State of Bavaria]]. The first mayor to tap a keg was [[Thomas Wimmer (politician)|Thomas Wimmer]].\n\n[[File:Gamsbaerte 2194.jpg|thumb|''[[Gamsbart|Gamsb\u00e4rte]]'' at the entry of the Oktoberfest restaurateurs, 2008]]\nBefore the festival officially starts, parades are held with the traditional marksmen's clubs, beer-tent waitresses, and landlords participating. Actually, there are two different parades which both end at the ''Theresienwiese''.

During the Oktoberfest, additional emergency vehicles are on the alert at the control centers, and extra staff is on hand in case they are needed.\n\nIn 2010, as a \"measure to public safety\", a dog and animal ban was put into place. 2012 brought the banning of glass bottles after the increase in the number of injuries and cuts.\n\nThe safety concepts of the event have been modified and adapted continuously over the past decades:\n\n* After the [[Oktoberfest terror attack|bombing in 1980]], the main entrance of the Oktoberfest was redesigned in 1981. \n* In 2008, the ''Theresienwiese'' was closed off to the public during the construction of the Oktoberfest. \n* In 2009, road blocks were raised, and access controls during the festival, due to the perceived threat of attacks by [[Islamism|Islamists]], were increased. \n* 2010 brought the implementation of advances to the security plan, including three lockdown rings around the ''Theresienwiese'' as well as access control and flight bans over the festival grounds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/angst-um-sicherheit-flugverbot-ueber-dem-oktoberfest-1.46696 | title=Flugverbot \u00fcber dem Oktoberfest | author= | date=17 May 2010 | website= | publisher=S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung | language=German | accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> \n* In addition, 52 {{convert|2|m|adj=on|spell=in}} high concrete [[bollard]]s were placed in the access roads and pedestrian entrances to prevent [[Vehicle-ramming attack]]s.\n* In 2011, the security measures were once again increased, this time with 170 partially retractable bollards also designed to prevent forcible access to the festival grounds with a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tz.de/muenchen/stadt/wiesn-sicherheitskonzept-poller-meta-676137.html | title=170 Poller sollen die Wiesn sch\u00fctzen | author=Stefan Dorner | date=16 March 2010 | website= | publisher=tz M\u00fcnchen | language=German | accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> \n* The Bavariaring is closed off, to allow security forces adequate space to react.

Previously, {{convert|350|m}} of the Oktoberfest were still unfenced. \n* Up to 450 security guards will stand at the 13 official entrances and check all incoming guests. Also, backpacks and bags with a volume of more than {{convert|3|l}} are no longer allowed on the festival grounds. \n* In addition, the front exit of the subway station Theresienwiese has been closed off.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.mobiler-rollzaun-um-die-theresienwiese-hochsicherheits-wiesn-2016-der-zaun-steht.973a981b-d37e-48ed-adf8-8015cc8affb0.html | title=Mobiler Rollzaun: Der Wiesn-K\u00e4fig steht! | author=S.

The Oktoberfest's power consumption totals approximately 2.7&nbsp;million [[kilowatt hour]]s, not including assembly and dismantling of the attractions. This amounts to about 13% of the daily electrical needs of the City of Munich. A large marquee requires an average of 400 kilowatts, and 300 kilowatts is required for bigger rides.\n\nTo supply the tents with natural gas, a four-kilometer long network of gas lines was built. The gas consumption amounts to 180,000 cubic meters for the kitchens of various catering establishments, and 20,000 cubic meters to heat the beer gardens. Most festival tents and rides use [[sustainable energy|green electricity]] from ''Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen'' to reduce pollution.\n\nBecause even a short [[power outage]] could lead to panic, all power supplies have redundancy and are fed separately. Even the lights of the individual marquees are supplied from two different substations. Despite all the precautions, on 25 September 2007, several hours of power failure occurred after a cable channel had been flooded due to heavy rains.\n\nSince the power outage occurred in the morning, there were service shortages in the catering areas, but no panic resulted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Dauerregen-Umsatz-Killer-und-Stromausfall-id2992681.html | title=Dauerregen: Umsatz-Killer und Stromausfall | author= | date=26 September 2007 | website= | publisher=Augsburger Allgemeine | language=German | accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure sufficient capacity of [[cellular network]]s, each year several mobile masts are set up in the lawn areas surrounding the festival.\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Oktoberfest UBahnTheresienwiese.JPG|thumb|left|[[Theresienwiese (Munich U-Bahn)|Theresienwiese]], the closest U-Bahn station to the Oktoberfest]]\nThe [[M\u00fcnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft]] reports transporting almost four million visitors, to and from, the festival grounds each Oktoberfest. Especially at night, the [[U-Bahn M\u00fcnchen|U-]] and [[S-Bahn M\u00fcnchen|S-Bahn]] trains are full. The underground station, [[Theresienwiese (Munich U-Bahn)|Theresienwiese]], has trains arriving at rush hour in three-minute intervals. The station occasionally needs to be closed due to overcrowding after the closure of the beer tents. To ensure smooth operation and safety of passengers, the M\u00fcnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft and the [[Deutsche Bahn]] have increased their security personnel. People are also encouraged to use the nearby stations [[Goetheplatz (Munich U-Bahn)|Goetheplatz]], [[Schwanthalerh\u00f6he (Munich U-Bahn)|Schwanthalerh\u00f6he]] and [[Munich Hackerbr\u00fccke station|Hackerbr\u00fccke]] (the latter of the S-Bahn) or walk the short distance from the [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] on foot.\n\nThere are significant negative effects pertaining to traffic. Since numerous festival goers make their way home by car despite having consumed alcohol, the [[Bavarian State Police]] carries out large-scale [[Driving under the influence|DUI controls]]. The city ring roads and highways around Munich are periodically blocked to allow only one lane of through traffic, which leads to massive traffic congestion.\n\nEspecially during the middle weekend of the festival, many Italians arrive with [[travel trailer|caravans]] (this weekend is therefore referred to by the residents of Munich as \"the Italian's weekend\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oktoberfest.de/en/article/About+the+Oktoberfest/About+the+Oktoberfest/The+Italian+Weekend+%E2%80%93+Oktoberfest,+ti+amo!/4118/ | title=The Italian Weekend \u2013 Oktoberfest, ti amo! | author= | date= | website=Oktoberfest.de | publisher= | language= | accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the government imposes camping bans in many parts of the city. At the same time, special parking outside the city is established, which can be reached by public transportation. Large parking areas are available, for example, close to the [[Allianz Arena]]. Nevertheless, the parking situation around the festival grounds is critical. As a consequence, the effort for controls and towing services is substantial.\n\n2010, in coordination with the new security concept, taxi stands were relocated. They are now found outside of the security ring further away from the fairground.\n\n===Trash and toilets===\nNearly 1,000&nbsp;tons of trash result annually from the Oktoberfest. The mountains of trash are hauled away and the ways cleanly washed down each morning. The cleaning is paid for in part by the city of Munich and in part by the sponsors. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 2004 the queues outside the toilets became so long that the police had to regulate access. To keep traffic moving through the toilets, men headed for the toilets were directed first to the urinals (giant enclosed grates) if they only needed to urinate. Consequently, the number of toilets was increased by 20% in 2005. Approximately 1,800 toilets and urinals are available today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nMany guests visit the quiet stalls to use their mobile phones. For this reason, there were plans in 2005 to install a [[Faraday cage]] around the toilets or to use [[Mobile phone jammer]]s to prevent telephoning with those devices. Jamming devices are, however, illegal in Germany, and Faraday cages made of copper would have been too expensive, so these ambitious plans were dropped, and signs were placed instead, warning toilet users not to use cellular phones in the stalls.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} More recently, amplifying live music in the toilets has led to them no longer representing a quiet retreat for telephoning.\n\n==Tents==\n{{Main|Oktoberfest tents}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}\nThere are currently fourteen large tents and twenty small tents at the Oktoberfest. The tents are wooden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingradar.com/construction-blog/oktoberfest-construction/ |title=Oktoberfest construction \u2013 Bavaria's biggest building project |work=Building Radar}}</ref> non-permanent structures which are constructed for and only used during the festival.

Traditionally, in the evening, the Oktoberfest band \"M\u00fcnchner Zwietracht\" plays all the Oktoberfest classics.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Marstall|url=http://www.marstall-oktoberfest.com/}}</ref>\n* '''''Armbrustsch\u00fctzenzelt''''' \u2013 Translates as the \"Crossbowman's Tent\", a competition that has been a part of the Oktoberfest since 1895.\n* '''''[[Hofbr\u00e4u-Festzelt]]''''' \u2013 The counterpart to the famous Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, this tent is especially popular with Americans, Australians and New Zealanders.\n* '''''Hacker-Festzelt''''' \u2013 One of the largest tents on the ''Wiesn'', they have a rock band that plays during the evening break of the brass band. This tent is marketing itself as ''Himmel der Bayern'' (Heaven of the Bavarians).\n* '''''Schottenhamel''''' \u2013 Reckoned to be the most important tent at the Oktoberfest, mainly because it is located at the beginning. On the first Saturday of the event, no beer is allowed to be served until the Mayor of Munich (currently [[Dieter Reiter]]) taps the first keg, at exactly high noon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anzapfen, the opening ritual of Oktoberfest|url=http://wiesnkini.de/magazin/anzapfen/|publisher=Wiesnkini|accessdate=18 January 2014|language=German}}</ref> Only then can the other tents begin to serve beer. The tent is very popular among younger people. A substantial part of the tent is guaranteed to traditional ''[[Studentenverbindung]]en'' (a particular form of student fraternities) and outfitted with their distinctive colors and coats of arms.\n* '''''Winzerer F\u00e4hndl''''' \u2013 Literally translates as \"Winzerers little flag\" and refers to the name of an old crossbowmen's guild, itself referring to a miltitary unit for the [[Thirty Year's War]]: \"F\u00e4hnlein\" being an ancient 16th/17th century German word for the equivalent of a company/battalion of ca. 400 mercenary soldiers. [[Kaspar III. Winzerer]] was the famous bavarian captain of such a unit. This tent is noted for its huge tower, with a ''Ma\u00df'' of Paulaner beer sitting atop it.\n* '''''Sch\u00fctzen-Festhalle''''' \u2013 This is a mid-sized tent. Situated under the [[Bavaria statue]], the current tent was newly built in 2004.\n* '''''K\u00e4fer Wiesn-Sch\u00e4nke''''' \u2013 The smallest of the large tents at the Oktoberfest, it is frequented by celebrities, and is known for its especially good \u2013 and expensive \u2013 food. In contrast to the other tents (which must close by 11&nbsp;pm), it is open until 12:30&nbsp;am, and it can be very difficult to gain admittance.\n* '''''Weinzelt''''' \u2013 Translates as \"wine tent\". This tent offers a selection of more than 15 wines, as well as ''Wei\u00dfbier''.\n* '''''L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u-Festhalle''''' \u2013 Above the entrance is a 4.50-meter (15&nbsp;foot) high lion who occasionally drinks from his beer. This is overshadowed by yet another tower where an even larger drinking lion sits.\n* '''''Br\u00e4urosl''''' (Hacker-Pschorr) \u2013 Translates as \"brewers Rosemary\". Named after the daughter of the original brewery owner (Pschorr), this tent has the usual brass band and yodeler. On the first Sunday of the festival, this tent hosts the hugely popular gay & lesbian party, Rosa Wiesn.\n* '''''Augustiner-Festhalle''''' \u2013 Considered by many locals to be the best tent, due to the fact it sells the favourite local brew, [[Augustiner]], from individually tapped wooden kegs rather than stainless steel vats used by the other tents.\n* '''''Ochsenbraterei''''' \u2013 True to its name, this tent offers a great variety of [[roasted ox]] dishes.\n* '''''Fischer-Vroni''''' \u2013 Translates as \"Fishers Veronika\". Another of the smaller tents. ''Fisch'' is the German word for fish and this tent carries a huge selection on its menu. The main dish is ''[[Steckerlfisch]]'', which is grilled outside of the tent.\n\n'''Small Tents'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oktoberfestpackages.com/oktoberfest-information|publisher=OktoberfestPackages.com |title=Oktoberfest Tents}}</ref>\n* '''''Able's Kalbs-Kuchl''''' \u2013 Resembling a large Bavarian hut, the \"calf kitchen\" is traditional and inviting yet still has a lively party atmosphere which Oktoberfest fans crave.\n* '''''Ammer H\u00fchner & Entenbraterei''''' \u2013 In 1885, poultry dealer Joseph Ammer was allowed to construct his small booth at the Oktoberfest, creating the world's first chicken roastery. Duck is offered as well.\n* '''''Bodo's Cafezelt''''' \u2013 Don't come to Bodo's looking for beer. Instead you'll find, exotic cocktails, Prosecco, champagne, coffee, donuts, ice cream, pastry, and strudel variations of all kinds.\n* '''''Caf\u00e9 Kaiserschmarrn''''' \u2013 Beautifully created by Rischart, the Caf\u00e9 holds a daily commemoration of the occasion of the first Oktoberfest \u2013 the wedding of Ludwig I and Therese of Saxony.\n* '''''Caf\u00e9 Mohrenkopf''''' \u2013 Since 1950 Caf\u00e9 Mohrenkopf has been baking cakes and pies fresh daily in the Oktoberfest tent.\n* '''''Feisingers Ka's und Weinstubn''''' \u2013 Cheese and everything that complements it is the specialty of the house in this unique tent.\n* '''''Gl\u00f6ckle Wirt''''' \u2013 A visual treat, decorated with oil paintings, antique instruments and cooking utensils, the Gl\u00f6ckle Wirt offers its visitors an authentic Oktoberfest experience in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.\n* '''''Heimer Hendl- und Entenbraterei''''' \u2013 Very popular among the locals, Heimer's is a family-friendly tent where authentic Oktoberfest tradition is timeless.\n* '''''Heinz Wurst- Und H\u00fchnerbraterei''''' \u2013 Since 1906, the Heinz sausage and chicken grill has been a fixture on the ''Wiesn'', specializing in authentic Oktoberfest tradition.\n* '''''Hochreiters Haxnbraterei''''' \u2013 Quality is paramount in Hochreiter's tent, where their BBQ experts prepare mouth-watering pork knuckles in the only ''Haxenbraterei'' on the Oktoberfest.\n* '''''M\u00fcnchner Kn\u00f6delei''''' \u2013 The dumpling is an icon of Bavarian cuisine, and \"preserving and spreading the dumpling culture\" is the motto of this smaller tent.\n* '''''Poschners H\u00fchner- Und Entenbraterei''''' \u2013 Poschner's famous roasted chicken and duck have been a tradition on the ''Wiesn'' for four generations.\n* '''''Schiebl's Kaffeehaferl''''' \u2013 With seating for about 100, Schiebl's comfy coffeehouse tent is a friendly meeting place for the whole family. \u2013 ''Haferl'' is the bavarian term for a (coffee, tea...) mug or pot.\n* '''''Wiesn Guglhupf Caf\u00e9-Dreh-Bar''''' \u2013 A ''Guglhupf'' is a German cake, like an English bundt cake, and this slowly moving carousel bar is easy to spot because it's shaped like one.\n* '''''Wildmoser H\u00fchnerbraterei''''' \u2013 Owned by the family Wildmoser since 1981, this small tent has been adopted and popularized by the Munich locals.\n* '''''Wildstuben''''' \u2013 The newest tent at Oktoberfest, you'll appreciate the intricate details of the woodwork and the homey hunting-lodge ambiance.\n* '''''Wirtshaus im Schichtl''''' \u2013 \"The Schichtl is as essential as beer, radish and chicken.\" former mayor Christian Ude once wrote: \"An Oktoberfest without Schichtl is inconceivable.\".\n* '''''Zum Stiftl''''' \u2013 famous for its traditional duck and roasted chicken dishes, cozy atmosphere, and daily entertainment.\n* '''''Zur Bratwurst''''' \u2013 Debuting in 2007, the Hochreiter family has brought back the former ''Bratwurstgl\u00f6ckl'' in the spirit of good old Munich Oktoberfest.\n\n== Other information ==\n[[File:Muenchen Oktoberfest Festzeltaufbau Bavaria im Hintergrund.jpg|thumb|Construction of the marquees]]\n* Experienced waiters need an average of only one and a half seconds to fill a ''[[Ma\u00df]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uniturm.de/news/ozapft-is | title=O'zapft is \u2013 Kurioses um das Oktoberfest | author= | date=17 September 2011 | website=Uniturm.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>\n* Letters, which are placed in the Oktoberfest mailboxes receive a special stamp from the post office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.baviere-quebec.org/archives/wsd/00346/index.php.en?sektor=0&jahr=0&seite=1&nr=1 | title=Oktoberfest fun facts | author= | date= | website= | publisher=State of Bavaria Quebec Office | language= | accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>\n* One attraction, which does not exist at other festivals, is the [[flea circus]].

Held annually in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], it is a 16- to 18-day [[folk festival]] running from mid or late September to the first Sunday in October, with more than six million people from around the world attending the event every year. Locally, it is called '''''d\u2019Wiesn''''', after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, [[Theresienwiese]]. The Oktoberfest is an important part of [[Bavaria]]n culture, having been held since the year 1810. Other cities across the world also hold [[Oktoberfest celebrations]] that are modeled after the original Munich event.\n\nDuring the event, large quantities of [[Oktoberfest Beer]] are consumed: during the 16-day festival in 2013, for example, {{convert|7.7|e6l|usbeerbbl impgal|lk=on}} were served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oktoberfesttours.travel/2014/10/19/oktoberfest-beer-consumption-2014/|title=Oktoberfest Beer Consumption}}</ref> Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.\n\nThe Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to [[German reunification]]. As such, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival would run until 3 October ([[German Unity Day]]). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Adam Pferderennen Oktoberfest 1823.jpg|thumb|Horse race at the Oktoberfest in Munich, 1823]]\n[[File:Carl Kricheldorf Portrait eines M\u00e4dchens in Tracht.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a girl wearing a ''[[dirndl]]'' dress]]\n''[[Kronprinz]]'' Ludwig (1786\u20131868), later [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|King Ludwig I]] (reign: 1825\u20131848), married Princess [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]] on 12 October 1810. The citizens of [[Munich]] were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the royal event. The fields were named ''Theresienwiese'' (\"Theresa's Meadow\") in honour of the Crown Princess, and have kept that name ever since, although the locals have since abbreviated the name simply to the \"''Wiesn''\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Oktoberfestbier|url=http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Oktoberfestbier.html|publisher=German Beer Institute|access-date=16 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020064254/http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Oktoberfestbier.html|archive-date=20 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Horse races, in the tradition of the 15th-century ''Scharlachrennen'' (Scarlet Race at Karlstor), were held on 18 October to honor the newlyweds.  It is widely understood that Andreas Michael Dall'Armi, a Major in the National Guard, proposed the idea. However, the origins of the horse races, and Oktoberfest itself, may have stemmed from proposals offered by Franz Baumgartner, a coachman and Sergeant in the National Guard. The precise origins of the festival and horse races remain a matter of controversy, however, the decision to repeat the horse races, spectacle, and celebrations in 1811 launched what is now the annual Oktoberfest tradition.\n\nThe fairground, once outside the city, was chosen due to its natural suitability. The Sendlinger Hill (today ''Theresienhohe'') was used as a grandstand for 40,000 race spectators. The festival grounds remained undeveloped except for the king's tent. The tastings of \"Traiteurs\" and other wine and beer took place above the visitors in the stands on the hill. Before the race started, a performance was held in homage of the bridegroom and of the royal family in the form of a train of 16 pairs of children dressed in ''Wittelsbach'' costumes, and costumes from the then nine Bavarian townships and other regions. This was followed by the punishing race with 30 horses on an 11,200-foot (3,400 meters) long racetrack, and concluded with the singing of a student choir. The first horse to cross the finish line belonged to Franz Baumgartner (one of the purported festival initiators). Horse racing champion and Minister of State [[Maximilian von Montgelas]] presented Baumgartner with his gold medal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiesnkini.de/magazin/das-erste-oktoberfest-1810/ | title=Das erste Oktoberfest | author= | date= | website=wiesnkini.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Transformation into a public festival==\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1811, a show was added to promote Bavarian agriculture. In 1813, the festival was canceled due to the involvement of Bavaria in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Oktoberfest grew from year to year. The horse races were accompanied by tree climbing, bowling alleys, and swings and other attractions. In 1818, [[carnival]] booths appeared; the main prizes awarded were of silver, [[porcelain]], and jewelry. The city fathers assumed responsibility for festival management in 1819, and it was decided that Oktoberfest become an annual event. In 1832, the date was moved some weeks later, as a Greek delegation came. It inspired them for the [[Zappas Olympics]] which became in 1896 the modern Olympic Games. Later, the Oktoberfest was lengthened and the date pushed forward because days are longer and warmer at the end of September. The horse race continued until 1960, and the agricultural show still exists today and is held every four years in the southern part of the festival grounds.\n\nTo honour the marriage of [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|Prince Ludwig]] and [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]], a parade took place for the first time in 1810. Since 1850, the parade has become an annual event and an important component of the Oktoberfest. Eight thousand people\u2014mostly from Bavaria\u2014and dressed in traditional costumes walk from Maximilian Street through the centre of Munich to the Oktoberfest grounds. The march is led by the ''[[M\u00fcnchner Kindl]]''.\n\n[[File:Munich Bavaria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bavaria statue]] above the Theresienwiese]]\nSince 1850, the [[Bavaria statue|statue of Bavaria]] has watched over the Oktoberfest. This worldly Bavarian [[patron]] was first sketched by [[Leo von Klenze]] in a classic style and [[Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler]] romanticised and \"[[germanisation|Germanised]]\" the draft. \n{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The statue was constructed by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier and [[Ferdinand von Miller]].\n\nIn 1853, the Bavarian [[Ruhmeshalle (Munich)|''Ruhmeshalle'']] was completed. In 1854, the festival was cancelled after 3,000 residents of Munich including the queen consort died during a [[cholera]] epidemic. There was no Oktoberfest in 1866 because Bavaria was involved in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. In 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] again forced the cancellation of the festival. In 1873, the festival was cancelled due to yet another cholera epidemic. In 1880, electric light illuminated more than 400 booths and tents. In 1881, booths selling ''[[Bratwurst]]'' opened and the first beer was served in glass mugs in 1892.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a re-organization took place. Until then, there were games of [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], large dance floors, and trees for climbing in the beer booths. Organizers wanted more room for guests and musicians which resulted in the booths becoming beer halls which are still used today.\n\nIn 1887, the parade of the Oktoberfest staff and breweries took place for the first time. This event showcases the splendidly decorated horse teams of the breweries and the bands that play in the festival tents. This event always takes place on the first Saturday of the Oktoberfest and serves as the official prelude to the Oktoberfest celebration.\n\n===20th century===\nAt the 100th anniversary of Oktoberfest in 1910, an estimated 120,000 litres of beer were consumed. Three years later, the \"''Br\u00e4urosl''\" was founded, which at that time was the largest pavilion to have ever been built, accommodating approximately 12,000 people.\n\nDue to World War I, Oktoberfest was temporarily suspended from 1914 to 1918. The two years after the war, in 1919 and 1920, Oktoberfest was replaced by the so-called \"''kleineres Herbstfest''\" (which can be translated as \"smaller autumn celebration\"), and in 1923 and 1924 the Oktoberfest was canceled due to hyper-inflation.\n\nDuring [[Nazism|National Socialism]], Oktoberfest was used as part of [[Nazi propaganda]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Seeing Hitler\u2019s Germany: Tourism in the Third Reich|last=Semmens|first=Kristin|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=978-1-349-51958-3|location=Basingstoke|pages=65}}</ref> In 1933, Jews were forbidden to work on the ''Wiesn''. Two years later, Oktoberfest's 125th anniversary was celebrated with all the frills. The main event was a big parade.\n\nThe slogan \"proud city \u2013 cheerful country\" was meant to show the alleged overcoming of differences between social classes, and can be seen as an example of the regime's consolidation of power. In 1938, after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had annexed [[Austria]] and won the [[Sudetenland]] via the [[Munich Agreement]], Oktoberfest was renamed to \"''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Volksfest''\" (Greater German folk festival), and as a showing of strength, the Nazi regime transported people from [[Sudetenland]] to the ''Wiesn'' by the score.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/braune-wiesn-wie-hitler-das-oktoberfest-stahl-a-947923.html | title=Wie Hitler das Oktoberfest stahl| author=Tobias Lill | date=25 September 2008 | website=wiesnkini.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, no Oktoberfest was celebrated. Following the war, from 1946 to 1948, Munich celebrated only the \"Autumn Fest\". The sale of proper Oktoberfest beer\u20142% stronger in [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|gravity]] than normal beer\u2014was not permitted; guests could only drink normal beer.\n\nSince its foundation, there have been 24 years in which Oktoberfest was not celebrated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muenchen-lese.de/index.php?article_id=141 | title=Das M\u00fcnchner Oktoberfest | author=Julia Meyer | date= | website= | publisher=M\u00fcnchen-Lese | language=German | accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1950, the festival has always been opened with the same traditional procedure: At noon, a 12-gun salute is followed by the tapping of the first keg of Oktoberfest beer by the Mayor of Munich with the proclamation \"''O'zapft is!''\" (\"It's tapped!\" in the [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian dialect]]). The Mayor then gives the first litre of beer to the [[List of Minister-Presidents of Bavaria|Minister-President of the State of Bavaria]]. The first mayor to tap a keg was [[Thomas Wimmer (politician)|Thomas Wimmer]].\n\n[[File:Gamsbaerte 2194.jpg|thumb|''[[Gamsbart|Gamsb\u00e4rte]]'' at the entry of the Oktoberfest restaurateurs, 2008]]\nBefore the festival officially starts, parades are held with the traditional marksmen's clubs, beer-tent waitresses, and landlords participating. Actually, there are two different parades which both end at the ''Theresienwiese''. They start around 9:45&nbsp;a.m. to 10.50&nbsp;am.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oktoberfestlederhosen.com/oktoberfest-music/ |publisher=oktoberfestlederhosen.com |title=Parade of the landlords }}</ref>\n\nDuring Oktoberfest, some locals wear [[Tyrolean hat|Bavarian hats]] (''Tirolerh\u00fcte''), which contain a tuft of chamois hair (''[[Gamsbart]]''). Historically, in Bavaria chamois hair was highly valued and prized. The more tufts of chamois hair on one's hat, the wealthier one was considered to be. Due to modern technology, this tradition has declined with the appearance of chamois hair imitations on the market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011|reason=need to determine who copied who in http://www.euro-poi.com/munich-oktoberfest-germany-121.html}}\n\nFor medical treatment of visitors, the Bavarian branch of the [[German Red Cross]] operates an aid facility and provides emergency medical care on the festival grounds, staffed with around 100 volunteer medics and doctors per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oktoberfest.bereitschaften.brk-muenchen.de/ |title=Herzlich Willkommen beim M\u00fcnchner Roten Kreuz |publisher=Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz |accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThey serve together with special detachments of [[Bavarian State Police|Munich police]], the fire department and other municipal authorities in the service centre at the ''Beh\u00f6rdenhof'' (authorities' court), a large building specially built for the Oktoberfest at the east side of the ''Theresienwiese'', just behind the tents.

Until 6:00&nbsp;pm, the orchestras in the tents only play quiet brass music, for example traditional folk music.

Because of problems enforcing the anti-smoking law in the big tents, an exception was granted to the Oktoberfest in 2008, although the sale of tobacco was not allowed. After heavy losses in the 2008 local elections, with the smoking ban being a big issue in political debates, the state's ruling party implemented general exemptions to beer tents and small pubs.\n\nThe change in regulations was aimed in particular to benefit the large tents of the Oktoberfest:<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,539902,00.html |title=Up in Smoke: Bavarian Politicians Want to Relax Smoking Ban |journal=Spiegel Online International |date=6 March 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}</ref> So, smoking in the tents is still legal, but the tents usually have non-smoking areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oktoberfest.de/en/article/About+the+Oktoberfest/About+the+Oktoberfest/Smoking+at+the+Oktoberfest/823/ |title=Smoking at the Oktoberfest |publisher=oktoberfest.de |accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> The sale of tobacco in the tents is now legal, but is widely boycotted by mutual agreement.

A so-called ''historische Wiesn'' (historical Oktoberfest) took place, starting one day earlier than usual on the southern part of the festival grounds. A specially brewed beer (solely available at the tents of the historical Oktoberfest), horse races, and a museum tent gave visitors an impression of how the event felt two centuries ago.\n\nIn 2013, 6.4&nbsp;million people visited Oktoberfest, and visitors were served 6.7&nbsp;million litres of beer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oktoberfestbeerfestivals.com/history-of-oktoberfest/ | title=A History | author= | date= | website=oktoberfestbeerfestivals.com| publisher= | language= | accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe festival was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n===Oide Wiesn===\nOn the occasion of the 200th anniversary in 2010 a so-called ''Historisches Oktoberfest'' (Historical Oktoberfest) was designed on the site of the Central Agricultural Festival at the south end of the ''[[Theresienwiese]]''.

In April/May it's the Munich ''Fr\u00fchlingsfest'' (spring festival) and [[Tollwood Festival]] in December with 650,000 visitors.\n\nAfter the Oktoberfest the next largest public fairs in Germany are the ''[[Cannstatter Volksfest]]'' in [[Stuttgart]] with about 4.5&nbsp;million visitors each year, the ''[[Cranger Kirmes]]'' in Herne (Wanne-Eickel) (the largest fair in [[Northrhine-Westphalia]]) with 4.4&nbsp;million visitors, the [[Largest Fair on the Rhine|Rheinkirmes]] in D\u00fcsseldorf (called largest fair on the Rhine), and the ''[[Freimarkt]]'' in [[Bremen]] (the biggest fair in northern Germany) with over 4&nbsp;million visitors per year each.\n\nAlso noteworthy is on the one hand the ''Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover'', the world's largest marksmen's Fun Fair in [[Hannover]] with over 1&nbsp;million visitors per year and on the other hand the [[Kiel Week]], the world's biggest sailing event and Volksfest in [[Kiel]], with about 3 million visitors.\n\n===Dates===\nIn recent years, the Oktoberfest runs for 16 days with the last day being the first Sunday in October.

The rides are extensively tested in advance, and the examination is performed by the cableways and temporary structures department of today's ''[[T\u00dcV S\u00dcD]]''.\n\nOn 30 September 1996, there was a collision on the Euro Star roller coaster, which injured 30, and was caused by a worn safety brake that went unnoticed during inspection. The Munich prosecutor tried to accuse the engineer, from T\u00dcV Munich, of negligent injury, but the proceedings did not come to a conclusion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.muenchen-der-eurostar-ist-jetzt-ein-russe.bb8e6e02-d6d1-4291-917d-57a5e5d5ff9b.html | title=Der Eurostar ist jetzt ein Russe | author=Daniel Aschoff | date=15 July 2008 | website= | publisher=Abendzeitung | language=German | accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo reduce the number of thefts, fights, and sexual assault cases during Oktoberfest, the protection measures for visitors have improved in recent years. For example, in 2003 the action ''Sichere Wiesn f\u00fcr M\u00e4dchen und Frauen'' (Safe Oktoberfest for Girls and Women) was launched.\n\n[[File:Beh\u00f6rdenhof Oktoberfest Muenchenjpg.jpg|thumb|The authorities court]]\nIn 2004, a new service center was placed in the authorities court, in which the police, the [[Munich Fire Department]], medical services, and a department of district administration is located. During the Oktoberfest, a police station specifically for the festival is installed, and can be reached with the emergency number 5003220.\n\nDue to the numerous Italian visitors to the Oktoberfest, since 2005 [[Law enforcement in Italy|officers]] from [[Bolzano]], Italy are also present. For decades now, the Bavarian [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]] has been responsible for the medical service at the Oktoberfest.\n\nAdditional medical services are located in the ''Fischer Vroni'' tent (Aicher Ambulance), and the [[Munich U-Bahn]] has commissioned additional backups in the [[rapid transit]] station Theresienwiese provided by the [[Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe]]. In the authorities court, an [[Ambulance emergency response vehicle|ambulance]] and miniature hospital, complete with [[operating theater]], are readily available. During the Oktoberfest, additional emergency vehicles are on the alert at the control centers, and extra staff is on hand in case they are needed.\n\nIn 2010, as a \"measure to public safety\", a dog and animal ban was put into place. 2012 brought the banning of glass bottles after the increase in the number of injuries and cuts.\n\nThe safety concepts of the event have been modified and adapted continuously over the past decades:\n\n* After the [[Oktoberfest terror attack|bombing in 1980]], the main entrance of the Oktoberfest was redesigned in 1981. \n* In 2008, the ''Theresienwiese'' was closed off to the public during the construction of the Oktoberfest. \n* In 2009, road blocks were raised, and access controls during the festival, due to the perceived threat of attacks by [[Islamism|Islamists]], were increased. \n* 2010 brought the implementation of advances to the security plan, including three lockdown rings around the ''Theresienwiese'' as well as access control and flight bans over the festival grounds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/angst-um-sicherheit-flugverbot-ueber-dem-oktoberfest-1.46696 | title=Flugverbot \u00fcber dem Oktoberfest | author= | date=17 May 2010 | website= | publisher=S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung | language=German | accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> \n* In addition, 52 {{convert|2|m|adj=on|spell=in}} high concrete [[bollard]]s were placed in the access roads and pedestrian entrances to prevent [[Vehicle-ramming attack]]s.\n* In 2011, the security measures were once again increased, this time with 170 partially retractable bollards also designed to prevent forcible access to the festival grounds with a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tz.de/muenchen/stadt/wiesn-sicherheitskonzept-poller-meta-676137.html | title=170 Poller sollen die Wiesn sch\u00fctzen | author=Stefan Dorner | date=16 March 2010 | website= | publisher=tz M\u00fcnchen | language=German | accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> \n* The Bavariaring is closed off, to allow security forces adequate space to react.

Previously, {{convert|350|m}} of the Oktoberfest were still unfenced. \n* Up to 450 security guards will stand at the 13 official entrances and check all incoming guests. Also, backpacks and bags with a volume of more than {{convert|3|l}} are no longer allowed on the festival grounds. \n* In addition, the front exit of the subway station Theresienwiese has been closed off.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.mobiler-rollzaun-um-die-theresienwiese-hochsicherheits-wiesn-2016-der-zaun-steht.973a981b-d37e-48ed-adf8-8015cc8affb0.html | title=Mobiler Rollzaun: Der Wiesn-K\u00e4fig steht! | author=S.

The Oktoberfest's power consumption totals approximately 2.7&nbsp;million [[kilowatt hour]]s, not including assembly and dismantling of the attractions. This amounts to about 13% of the daily electrical needs of the City of Munich. A large marquee requires an average of 400 kilowatts, and 300 kilowatts is required for bigger rides.\n\nTo supply the tents with natural gas, a four-kilometer long network of gas lines was built. The gas consumption amounts to 180,000 cubic meters for the kitchens of various catering establishments, and 20,000 cubic meters to heat the beer gardens. Most festival tents and rides use [[sustainable energy|green electricity]] from ''Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen'' to reduce pollution.\n\nBecause even a short [[power outage]] could lead to panic, all power supplies have redundancy and are fed separately. Even the lights of the individual marquees are supplied from two different substations. Despite all the precautions, on 25 September 2007, several hours of power failure occurred after a cable channel had been flooded due to heavy rains.\n\nSince the power outage occurred in the morning, there were service shortages in the catering areas, but no panic resulted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Dauerregen-Umsatz-Killer-und-Stromausfall-id2992681.html | title=Dauerregen: Umsatz-Killer und Stromausfall | author= | date=26 September 2007 | website= | publisher=Augsburger Allgemeine | language=German | accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure sufficient capacity of [[cellular network]]s, each year several mobile masts are set up in the lawn areas surrounding the festival.\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Oktoberfest UBahnTheresienwiese.JPG|thumb|left|[[Theresienwiese (Munich U-Bahn)|Theresienwiese]], the closest U-Bahn station to the Oktoberfest]]\nThe [[M\u00fcnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft]] reports transporting almost four million visitors, to and from, the festival grounds each Oktoberfest. Especially at night, the [[U-Bahn M\u00fcnchen|U-]] and [[S-Bahn M\u00fcnchen|S-Bahn]] trains are full. The underground station, [[Theresienwiese (Munich U-Bahn)|Theresienwiese]], has trains arriving at rush hour in three-minute intervals. The station occasionally needs to be closed due to overcrowding after the closure of the beer tents. To ensure smooth operation and safety of passengers, the M\u00fcnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft and the [[Deutsche Bahn]] have increased their security personnel. People are also encouraged to use the nearby stations [[Goetheplatz (Munich U-Bahn)|Goetheplatz]], [[Schwanthalerh\u00f6he (Munich U-Bahn)|Schwanthalerh\u00f6he]] and [[Munich Hackerbr\u00fccke station|Hackerbr\u00fccke]] (the latter of the S-Bahn) or walk the short distance from the [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] on foot.\n\nThere are significant negative effects pertaining to traffic. Since numerous festival goers make their way home by car despite having consumed alcohol, the [[Bavarian State Police]] carries out large-scale [[Driving under the influence|DUI controls]]. The city ring roads and highways around Munich are periodically blocked to allow only one lane of through traffic, which leads to massive traffic congestion.\n\nEspecially during the middle weekend of the festival, many Italians arrive with [[travel trailer|caravans]] (this weekend is therefore referred to by the residents of Munich as \"the Italian's weekend\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oktoberfest.de/en/article/About+the+Oktoberfest/About+the+Oktoberfest/The+Italian+Weekend+%E2%80%93+Oktoberfest,+ti+amo!/4118/ | title=The Italian Weekend \u2013 Oktoberfest, ti amo! | author= | date= | website=Oktoberfest.de | publisher= | language= | accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the government imposes camping bans in many parts of the city. At the same time, special parking outside the city is established, which can be reached by public transportation. Large parking areas are available, for example, close to the [[Allianz Arena]]. Nevertheless, the parking situation around the festival grounds is critical. As a consequence, the effort for controls and towing services is substantial.\n\n2010, in coordination with the new security concept, taxi stands were relocated. They are now found outside of the security ring further away from the fairground.\n\n===Trash and toilets===\nNearly 1,000&nbsp;tons of trash result annually from the Oktoberfest. The mountains of trash are hauled away and the ways cleanly washed down each morning. The cleaning is paid for in part by the city of Munich and in part by the sponsors. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 2004 the queues outside the toilets became so long that the police had to regulate access. To keep traffic moving through the toilets, men headed for the toilets were directed first to the urinals (giant enclosed grates) if they only needed to urinate. Consequently, the number of toilets was increased by 20% in 2005. Approximately 1,800 toilets and urinals are available today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nMany guests visit the quiet stalls to use their mobile phones. For this reason, there were plans in 2005 to install a [[Faraday cage]] around the toilets or to use [[Mobile phone jammer]]s to prevent telephoning with those devices. Jamming devices are, however, illegal in Germany, and Faraday cages made of copper would have been too expensive, so these ambitious plans were dropped, and signs were placed instead, warning toilet users not to use cellular phones in the stalls.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} More recently, amplifying live music in the toilets has led to them no longer representing a quiet retreat for telephoning.\n\n==Tents==\n{{Main|Oktoberfest tents}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}\nThere are currently fourteen large tents and twenty small tents at the Oktoberfest. The tents are wooden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingradar.com/construction-blog/oktoberfest-construction/ |title=Oktoberfest construction \u2013 Bavaria's biggest building project |work=Building Radar}}</ref> non-permanent structures which are constructed for and only used during the festival.

Traditionally, in the evening, the Oktoberfest band \"M\u00fcnchner Zwietracht\" plays all the Oktoberfest classics.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Marstall|url=http://www.marstall-oktoberfest.com/}}</ref>\n* '''''Armbrustsch\u00fctzenzelt''''' \u2013 Translates as the \"Crossbowman's Tent\", a competition that has been a part of the Oktoberfest since 1895.\n* '''''[[Hofbr\u00e4u-Festzelt]]''''' \u2013 The counterpart to the famous Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, this tent is especially popular with Americans, Australians and New Zealanders.\n* '''''Hacker-Festzelt''''' \u2013 One of the largest tents on the ''Wiesn'', they have a rock band that plays during the evening break of the brass band. This tent is marketing itself as ''Himmel der Bayern'' (Heaven of the Bavarians).\n* '''''Schottenhamel''''' \u2013 Reckoned to be the most important tent at the Oktoberfest, mainly because it is located at the beginning. On the first Saturday of the event, no beer is allowed to be served until the Mayor of Munich (currently [[Dieter Reiter]]) taps the first keg, at exactly high noon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anzapfen, the opening ritual of Oktoberfest|url=http://wiesnkini.de/magazin/anzapfen/|publisher=Wiesnkini|accessdate=18 January 2014|language=German}}</ref> Only then can the other tents begin to serve beer. The tent is very popular among younger people. A substantial part of the tent is guaranteed to traditional ''[[Studentenverbindung]]en'' (a particular form of student fraternities) and outfitted with their distinctive colors and coats of arms.\n* '''''Winzerer F\u00e4hndl''''' \u2013 Literally translates as \"Winzerers little flag\" and refers to the name of an old crossbowmen's guild, itself referring to a miltitary unit for the [[Thirty Year's War]]: \"F\u00e4hnlein\" being an ancient 16th/17th century German word for the equivalent of a company/battalion of ca. 400 mercenary soldiers. [[Kaspar III. Winzerer]] was the famous bavarian captain of such a unit.

His father, Sidney Lazard, is a former foreign [[correspondent]], and his mother, Julie (n\u00e9e Thayer), is a photographer. In 1974, the family relocated to Paris where his father was stationed by ABC News. After his parents' divorce when he was a freshman in high school, Lazard marked time in boarding schools and at [[Emory University]]. Transferring to NYU to study acting, he was \"discovered\" in a bar by a talent agent and was soon appearing in TV commercials.\n\n===Acting career===\nAfter a small role in ''[[Spike of Bensonhurst]]'' in 1988, Lazard landed the recurring role of a punk-rock undercover cop on NBC's ''[[Miami Vice]]'', appearing in three episodes. To pay for acting classes, he began a brief career as a model. Small parts in features (i.e., ''[[Born to Ride (film)|Born to Ride]]'' in 1991) and regular roles in unsuccessful series (e.g., ''Second Chances''; CBS 1993\u201394) followed.\n\nIn 1995, Lazard landed the role of a charming stockbroker on the primetime CBS soap ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]'', but the series floundered and despite some retooling and a title change to \"CPW\", the show was cancelled after its second season.

Hence the idea of using foreign troops, that would be recruited for the combats and that would be organised in a dedicated corps: the French Foreign Legion. \n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

The Legion became a depository for those who did not conform to the governing agenda. There was also concern over those seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had journeyed in the hopes of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} To the State, they threatened the stability of the kingdom and its economy it became urgent to the group and distance them.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the men in the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}} and the war, deemed very unpopular. Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.
