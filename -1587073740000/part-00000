MacVeah, The Dial Press 1928), p. 331-333.</ref>\n}}\n\nOn May 18, 1926, [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] disappeared from Venice Beach, California after going for a swim. She reappeared in Mexico five weeks later, stating she had escaped from kidnappers holding her for ransom there. Her disappearance, reappearance and subsequent court inquiries regarding the allegation that the kidnapping story was a hoax carried out to conceal a tryst with a lover precipitated a media frenzy that changed the course of McPherson's career.\n\n==Disappearance off Venice Beach==\n\nOn May 18, 1926, McPherson went with her secretary to Ocean Park Beach north of [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]] to swim. Soon after arriving, McPherson was nowhere to be found. It was thought she had drowned.\n[[File:LAPLMcPherson BeachDisappearance.jpg|thumb|Hosts of followers of Aimee Semple McPherson gathered on the beach at Ocean Park in 1926 when she was first believed to have drowned. Here they watch as the surf was being dragged in a hunt for her body.|399x399px]]\n\nMcPherson was scheduled to hold a service that day; her mother Minnie Kennedy preached the sermon instead, saying at the end, \"Sister is with Jesus,\" sending parishioners into a tearful frenzy. [[Mourner]]s crowded Venice Beach and the commotion sparked days-long [[mass media|media]] coverage fueled in part by [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'' and a stirring poem by [[Upton Sinclair]] to commemorate the tragedy. Daily updates appeared in newspapers across the country and parishioners held day-and-night seaside [[vigil]]s. One parishioner drowned while searching for the body, and a diver died of [[Hypothermia#Water immersion|exposure]].\n\nKenneth G. Ormiston, the [[engineer]] for [[KXOL-FM|KFSG]], had taken other assignments around late December 1925 and left his job at the Temple.<ref>Cox, Raymond L. The Verdict is In, 1983. pp. 37\u201338.</ref>  Newspapers later linked McPherson and Ormiston, who was seen driving up the coast with an unidentified woman. Some believed McPherson and Ormiston, who was married, had become romantically involved and had run off together.\n\nMcPherson's children, Roberta Star Semple and Rolf McPherson, were scrutinized by suspicious news reporters trying to ascertain their degree of distraughtness. Roberta hid in the basement of her parsonage home as news reporters entered the building and began searching though McPherson's room and belongings looking for clues to her whereabouts.<ref>Epstein, pp. 295.</ref>  Rolf, who had been boarding in a remote farmhouse for the past three years, was besieged by reporters who heard a rumor he might have talked to his missing mother by telephone.<ref>Mavity, Nancy Barr \"Sister Aimee\" (Doubleday Doran, 1931), p. 103.</ref>\n\n===Sighting claims===\n[[File:ASM Edmonton.jpg|thumb|left|During the disappearance of Aimee Semple McPherson, from May 18 to June 23, 1926, there were many sighting claims. Canadian officials thought they had the evangelist, as attested to by three investigators, however, it turned out to be another woman.]]\nAfter her disappearance from the beach, many sightings of Aimee Semple McPherson were recorded.<ref>Hardy Trial, p. 1196.</ref> Immediately, there was a report of her driving away from the beach in her Angelus Temple uniform, as witnessed by a Culver City detective.<ref>Madera Tribune, Number 16, May 19, 1926, p. 1.</ref> However, this later was confirmed to be a parishioner in uniform: a dark cape and tie over a white nurse's dress, typical of what many female members wore.<ref>Cox, p. 15.</ref>  McPherson \"sightings\" were abundant, as many as 16 in different cities and other locations on the same day.<ref>Cox, p. 33-34.</ref>\n\nThe Angelus Temple received letters and calls claiming knowledge on the missing McPherson. One message stated McPherson was gone for a much needed rest and would be back July 16. Another, given by a spiritualist, indicated that while in a trance she had seen McPherson bound and apparently in distress in a cabin.<ref>''Reading Eagle,'' Saw Woman in Trance(Reading PA); July 18, 1926; p. 1.</ref>\n\nOn June 5, newspaper headlines announced McPherson had been found in Canada, as stated in a telegram message sent by authorities. The sender of the telegram knew McPherson from a revival meeting in Toronto, Canada. Tracked by three detectives, a woman reported to have been the missing evangelist was found in Edmonton, Alberta; she had arrived there in a Studebaker via Calgary, followed by another car. The woman checked into the Corona hotel and it was reported she was \"positively identified\" by the three operators as the revivalist. It was only after the woman was picked up by Canadian authorities and gave proof of her identity as someone else that the sighting report was rescinded on June 7.<ref>Madera Tribune, (United Press) Mrs. Semple McPherson is located at Edmonton by Canadian Authorities; Number 30, June 5, 1926; p. 1.</ref><ref>Madera Tribune,(United Press) Report Woman Seen in Canada Proves to Be False; Number 31, June 7, 1926; p. 1.</ref>  During the period of her disappearance, while there were \"various and voluminous claims,\" of McPherson sightings, none at all came from Carmel-by-the-Sea, a California town that would later dominate the headlines for such sightings.<ref>Hardy trial, p. 482.</ref>\n\n===Ransom demands===\n\nSeveral ransom notes and other similar communications were sent to the Temple, some of which were relayed to the police, who ultimately dismissed them as fraudulent. For a time, Mildred Kennedy, McPherson's mother, offered a $25,000<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">about US $315,000.00 in 2012 dollars</ref> reward for information leading to the return of her daughter.\n\nThe ransom demands included a handwritten note by the \"Revengers\" who wanted $500,000<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">about US $6.3 million in 2012.</ref> and another for $25,000<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> conveyed by a blind lawyer, Russell A.

Kennedy regarded the notes as hoaxes, believing her daughter dead.<ref>Cox, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> She set herself about the task of continuing to raise money for a needed church building expansion, which became part of an elaborate memorial service commemorating the evangelist's death. Tearfully, on June 20, Kennedy spoke somberly to the gathered parishioners: \"We do not believe that Sister's body will ever be recovered. Her young body was too precious to Jesus.\" Collection plates yielded $34,910.<ref>Independent Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Lindsey, David; Sister Aimee's Mysterious Disappearance July 28, 1974; p. 120.</ref>\n\n==Reappearance in Mexico and return to Los Angeles==\n\n[[File:LAPLRamon Teresa Jorge Gonzales.jpg|thumb|left|Ramon and Teresa Gonzales and their son, Jorge, who live in Agua Prieta, Mexico, and appeared in court to testify that Aimee Semple McPherson staggered into their yard and was found in a state of complete exhaustion following her asserted {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} hike through the desert.]]\n\nShortly thereafter, on June 23, McPherson stumbled out of the desert in [[Agua Prieta]], [[Sonora]], a [[Mexico|Mexican]] town across the border from [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]], [[Arizona]]. The Mexican couple she approached there thought she had died when McPherson collapsed in front of them. She stirred and the couple brought her inside and covered her with blankets.<ref>Cox, p. 70.</ref> She claimed she had been kidnapped, drugged, tortured, and held for ransom in a shack by two men and a woman, \"Steve,\" \"Rose,\" <ref>McPherson, Aimee Semple, In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927), p.16.

Note: Indictments were made against Steve Doe, Rose Doe, and John Doe</ref>  An hour after reviving her, the husband, R. R. Gonzales, alerted the leader of Agua Prieta, Presidente Ernesto Boubion, to see her. Boubion stated she grasped his wrist, trembled violently, and asked where she was. She looked ill and appeared agitated, and declined both food and drink. She was transported across the border to the Douglas, Arizona, police station and then the Douglas hospital. Her shoes were white with desert dust and her hands were covered with grime. A nurse picked some cactus spines from her legs and rubbed some preparation on a blistered toe. McPherson went on about protection for her 16-year-old daughter and warned her assailants had plans to make off with Mary Pickford and other celebrities.<ref>The Waco News-Tribune; Missing Woman Evangelist Escapes Captors; June 24, 1926 p. 2.</ref><ref>The San Bernardino County Sun; Evangelist's Version Clue Plot on Movie Stars is Told Friday, June 25, 1926; p. 1-2.</ref> At that time no one believed she was Aimee Semple McPherson, the missing Angelus Temple pastor. A reporter heard the claims and visited the hospital. Though she was emaciated and barely recognizable, the journalist said he knew her from covering past revival meetings.<ref>Cox, pp. 71\u201372, 85, 209\u2013211.</ref>  Once properly identified, her family and some Los Angeles authorities took a train to see her.\n\nHer statement taken in the Douglas Hospital explained that while on the beach near Los Angeles, a young couple approached and asked her to come pray for their sick child. When she went with them and looked in on the bundle in the back seat of an automobile, they shoved her into their car. At the same time a cloth was held over her face loaded with a sickly sweet substance, later speculated to be [[chloroform]] with an additive.[[File:Aimee Semple McPherson in DouglasAZHospital.jpg|thumbnail|right| After emerging from the Mexican desert, McPherson convalesces in a hospital with her family in Douglas, Arizona 1926.

On the far right Deputy District Attorney Joseph Ryan is alongside her son, Rolf McPherson.|399x399px]] After awakening, she was no longer clothed in her bathing suit and was wearing a dress. A woman named \"Rose,\" who displayed professional nursing skills, looked after her. Held for a time in what was a boarded up room in a house that appeared to be an urban area, she was later moved to the remote shack in Mexico. Trying to elicit some personal information to prove they had her, one of her captors burned McPherson's hand with his cigar, but felt bad about it and stopped. McPherson's statement gave details on how she escaped the desert shack while her assailants were out on errands. She cut her bonds on a metal can lid, a technique she later successfully demonstrated several times before skeptical reporters,<ref>Thomas, ''Vanishing Evangelist'', p. 278.</ref> and climbed out the shack's back window. Using a mountain to navigate, she made her way north. She told how she used her garments to shield herself from the afternoon sun and carefully stepped around any shaggy bushes in her path. In the evening, lights from a town guided her to its streets. Terrified by the unexpected savagery of nearby barking dogs behind a fence, she entered the yard of a Mexican couple, R. R. Gonzales and his wife.<ref>McPherson, Aimee Semple, ''In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life'' (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927) p. 265.</ref> Her story was transmitted and transcribed across telegraph and phone lines becoming front-page international news.\n\nOn the way back to Los Angeles, the train was stopped and boarded by two men who claimed to have earlier seen McPherson during the time she stated she was kidnapped. One man, realizing a mistaken identity, apologized and excused himself after seeing her. However, in a much publicized scene, the other individual stated he had seen her at a Tucson, Arizona street corner four weeks earlier, in May. By his own admission, he had never seen the evangelist in person, only by photograph. The woman he saw in the street wore a tight, low fitting hat shading her eyes and walked in different gait than McPherson used. Yet for him it was those obscured eyes that confirmed his identification. McPherson wrote he was her first experience with such \"identifications,\" others of which were even \"more absurd,\" and \"all were flung to the world in newspaper headlines.\" Later, this witness was discarded as his sighting came at a time when McPherson was accused by Los Angeles prosecutors to have instead been in Carmel-by-the Sea, California.<ref>Cox, p. 94.</ref><ref>McPherson, Aimee Semple, ''In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life'' (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927) p. 39.</ref>\n\nFollowing her return to [[Los Angeles]] from Douglas, McPherson was greeted at the train station by 30,000\u201350,000 people, more than for almost any other personage.<ref name=\"Melton, J.

Many Los Angeles area churches were also annoyed. The divorcee McPherson had settled in their town and many of their parishioners were now attending her church, with its elaborate sermons that, in their view, diminished the dignity of the Gospel. The Chamber of Commerce, together with Reverend [[Robert P. Shuler]] leading the Los Angeles Church Federation, and assisted by the press and others, became an informal alliance to determine if her disappearance was caused by other than a kidnapping.<ref name=\"Epstein, p. 301\">Epstein, p. 301.</ref><ref name=\"Sutton, pp. 120\u2013122\">Sutton, pp. 120\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn response to an increasing undercurrent of doubt, the leadership of the Angelus Temple debated whether to let the matter drop or push for vindication. McPherson welcomed the opportunity for more publicity, since she saw it as a way to expose more people to her vision of Jesus Christ. Her mother, Mildred Kennedy, cynically thought the controversy might get away from them and become disruptive to the Temple's activities. Judge Carlos Hardy, an influential friend of the Temple and McPherson, decided to go to court to present their complaint, over the stern objections of  Kennedy and lawyers hired for advice.\n\n==Grand jury inquiries==\n\nThere were several phases of  grand jury inquiries regarding Aimee Semple McPherson, all conducted by Los Angeles District Attorney Asa Keyes. The first inquiry was about charging McPherson's kidnappers, with indictments against Steve Doe, Rose Doe, and John Doe,<ref>Shuler, Robert, ''Fighting Bob Shuler of Los Angeles'' Dog Ear Publishing, 2012 p. 178.</ref> convening on July 8, 1926, and adjourning on July 20, 1926. However, it became immediately apparent the evangelist was being interrogated from a viewpoint of hostile skepticism. Prosecutor Asa Keyes insinuated she was a charlatan who was run out of various cities during her revivals. McPherson offered to show news clippings to the contrary, attesting to the success of her work and requests for return visits. Annoyed, Keyes continued, focusing on the belief the disappearance was plot to elicit money for a memorial fund commemorating McPherson's death or for promotional purposes. Her sanity was also questioned: perhaps she had simply wandered off suffering from amnesia.<ref>Spiritual Leaders Aimee Semple McPherson; CHBiographies, epub 2-3 Infobase Learning, July 18, 2013.</ref>  The first inquiry ended with a determination that there was not enough evidence to charge either alleged kidnappers or the McPherson group for fraud.\n\nThe second inquiry, amidst frenzied publicity, started on August 3 in response to new developments suggesting that rather than being held by kidnappers, McPherson was cohabitating with her former employee Kenneth Ormiston in the resort town of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The inquiry stalled due to lack of evidence and ended by mid-August. Later, when a defense witness, Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff, sided with the prosecution as a betrayed co-plotter, another grand jury inquiry was ordered to begin in late September. Testimony and evidence from Carmel-by-the Sea was reintroduced by the prosecution, together with their new witness. Their intent was show proof of a conspiracy by the McPherson party to manufacture evidence in bolstering her kidnapping story. McPherson's defense team, previously overshadowed by publicity favoring the prosecution, was able to comprehensively explain their side of the case.\n\nA jury trial was scheduled for January, 1927, to charge the evangelist, her mother and several other defendants with criminal conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice. If convicted, the counts added up to maximum prison time of 42 years.<ref name=\"Sutton, pp. 133\u2013134\">Sutton, pp. 133\u2013134.</ref><ref name=\"Epstein, p. 312\">Epstein, p. 312, NOTE: The charges were a criminal conspiracy to commit acts injurious to public morals, to prevent and [[obstruction of justice|obstruct justice]], and to prevent the due administration of the laws, and of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to commit the crime of subordination of perjury.</ref><ref>The People vs. Aimee Semple McPherson, et al., Case CR 29181, January 10, 1927; Superior Court of Los Angeles County, County records and Archives</ref>  Further statements and information were taken from various witnesses ahead of the projected trial through early January 1927.\n\n===Escape through the desert===\n\n[[File:LAPLPresidente Ernesto Boubion00021695.jpg|thumb|left|Presidente Ernesto Boubion of Agua Prieta, Mexico, as per his translator William Appel and Aimee Semple McPherson, attempted to solicit $5000 from the evangelist in exchange for his favorable opinion of her reported kidnapping story.<ref>Corsicana Daily Sun; July 17, 1926; p. 1.</ref>]]The first inquiry started on July 8, 1926, with reading McPherson's statement into the record. Mildred Kennedy broke down and sobbed during the reading, which took most of a day to enter. Testimony continued with what allegedly happened in Mexico, though the most comprehensive portions, especially from the defense, came later in October.\n\nMcPherson's disappearance was concurrent with Mexico transforming itself into a secular socialist state, with religious restrictions that led up to the [[Cristero War]] of 1926\u20131929. Mexican officials immediately expressed that McPherson could not have been illegally taken onto their land. Even as the woman in the Arizona hospital was identified as the missing evangelist, Consul General of Mexico, George A. Lubert, announced that McPherson could not have been taken across the border against her will.

However, new developments continued afterwards. The prosecution wanted to question H. C. Benedict about the contents of a blue steamer trunk purportedly belonging to Ormiston confiscated in September, but the landlord of the cottage died in mid-November. Apart from affidavits and messages, Kenneth Ormiston still had not given testimony. More importantly, Wiseman-Sielaff appeared to be giving new information concerning the conspiracy implicating McPherson and her circle of friends and acquaintances.\n\nBy late December, the prosecution determined their new star witness, Wiseman-Sielaff, could no longer be a considered a credible witness. Without her, District Attorney Asa Keyes considered other evidence insufficient to continue prosecuting the case. Keyes submitted a document to have the case dismissed, conveying that without Wiseman-Sielaff's testimony, the alleged conspiracy was impossible to prove. He added \"Reputable witnesses have testified sufficiently concerning both the Carmel incident and the return of Mrs. McPherson from her so-called kidnapping adventure to enable her to be judged in the only court which has jurisdiction \u2014the court of public opinion.\"<ref>Thomas, Vanishing Evangelist; p. 320</ref> ''The Examiner'' newspaper reported that [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|Los Angeles district attorney]] [[Asa Keyes]] had dropped all charges against McPherson and associated parties on January 10, 1927.<ref>Sutton, p. 136.

No mention of the $800,000 is given by biographers of McPherson to include Thomas, Blumhofer, Sutton, Cox, or Epstein. No evidence for the commonly quoted lower figure of $30,000 is found; details and the source of the rumor ambiguous.</ref><ref>Author Stephen J.

Praeger Pub Text, Westport, Conn., 1999).\n\nIn late 1928, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury began looking into the possibility that Keyes had been bribed to drop charges against McPherson. An investigation was started and Keyes was acquitted (Shaefer, Silvia Anne; ''Aimee Semple Mcpherson'', Infobase Publishing, New York, 2004; p. 71). A November 13 ''United Press'' dispatch from London quotes the evangelist as saying: \"I never paid a penny. The reason I was freed was that the woman who made the charges confessed she had lied and had been hired to tell the story. With her confession, I was automatically released.\"  Journalist Rodger M. Grace comments the reality was more complex: Keyes, because of inconsistencies in Wiseman-Sielaff\u2019s account, could not vouch for the truthfulness of her testimony, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Albert Lee Stephens Sr. dismissed the charges. {{cite web|author=Roger M.

Holmdahl, who fought extensively in earlier Latin American turmoil wars and was cleared by a Mexican judge as a suspect in the February 6, 1926 theft of [[Pancho Villa]]'s head, enigmatically replied regarding McPherson, \"Well, maybe I did and maybe I didn't.\"  In contrast, unless intoxicated, he always emphatically denied participating in a grave robbery that stole Villa's head.</ref>  Therefore, anyone could still accuse her of a hoax without fear of slander charges and frequently did so.

Ormiston, and Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff.  Dr. A. M.

Ormiston and Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff stood out as being the least questioned and the most questioned persons by the grand jury inquiry, each nevertheless receiving headlines and huge amounts of publicity. Ormiston shunned the spotlight and Wiseman-Sielaff sought it out, inserting herself into the McPherson grand jury inquiry at a time when it stalled and prosecutor Asa Keyes was ready to drop it.\n\n===Kenneth Ormiston===\n\n[[File:LAPLKenneth G Ormiston sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Kenneth G. Ormiston, former Angelus Temple radio operator.]]\nAs McPherson's accused lover who allegedly assisted in the kidnapping fraud, Kenneth G. Ormiston was a prominent defendant in the 1926 grand jury inquiry.  He had been McPherson's radio operator and was crucial in getting her programs on the air. He was described as about {{convert|5|ft|11|in|cm}} tall, bald, slender, and good-natured with a wonderful disposition.<ref>Beek, Joseph Allan; Secretary of the Senate; The Senate of the State of California Sitting as a High Court of Impeachment In the Matter of the Impeachment of Carlos S.

Around late December 1925, he left his job at the Angelus Temple, then disappeared, prompting his wife to report him missing in January, 1926. Some rumors placed him in Europe with McPherson, however, during that time, he called the Angelus Temple from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State in March where he was employed as a car salesman.<ref name=\"Epstein, p. 301\"/><ref>Hamilton Evening Journal October 16, 1926; p. 24,</ref>  McPherson's daughter, Roberta, joined her there in Europe to prevent further gossip.\n\nMcPherson's May 18 disappearance coincided with Ormiston taking possession of a cottage he rented for three months in a seaside resort town of Carmel-by-the Sea. Rumors developed his companion was the missing McPherson, and police sought Ormiston. He immediately turned himself into authorities on May 27, denying that he \"went into hiding,\" and stated his name connected to the evangelist was \"a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman.\" <ref>Thomas Vanishing, p. 31.</ref>  Though he did not mention Carmel to head off unwanted attention there, he gave details of his previous movements.<ref>Cox, pp. 37\u201338.</ref> Since his name was now inserted into the McPherson case, Ormiston was worried about being followed around.\n\nHis concerns materialized two days later. On the evening of May 29, near Santa Barbara, a reporter tracked Ormiston's blue Chrysler sedan coupe, and flagged it down. After examining the driver and his female passenger, the reporter determined while the man was Ormiston, he could not identify the woman, \"Miss X,\" as McPherson.<ref>Beek, Hardy Impeachment, p. 397.</ref> As the result of the incident, a Santa Barbara Morning Press article headline later read: ''Road Watched for Ormiston and Evangelist''.<ref>Beek, Hardy Impeachment, p. 407.</ref>[[File:LAPLKenneth G Ormiston Blue Chrysler Sedan.jpeg|thumb|Kenneth G.

In response to the intense news coverage of a half a dozen or more witnesses suddenly alleging they saw McPherson there, Prosecutor Asa Keyes launched another manhunt for Ormiston. McPherson herself pleaded through the papers for Ormiston to clear the matter up. Annoyed, Ormiston sent a letter from New York to Asa Keyes denouncing the treatment received from newspapers and officials as \u201cnasty publicity and subsequent persecution by self-styled investigators,\" and that he had no intention of appearing before the Los Angeles grand jury.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, United Press ''Ormiston Peeved, Will Not Appear,'' Number 213, July 20, 1926, p. 1.</ref> He released a lengthy statement to the police and several newspapers.

He desired not to complicate the situation since \"intrigue and hokum were as thick as San Francisco fog.\"  He maintained he was not at Carmel-by-the-Sea with Mrs. McPherson, stated he violated no conspiracy laws and was not afraid to face trial.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, Number 41, December 18, 1926 ''Ormiston is in Los Angeles to prove Innocence.

He determined other evidence at Carmel was too vague for a successful perjury prosecution against the defendants.<ref>Hardy impeachment; 886-887, p. 1123.</ref> An unexpected opportunity, though, invigorated the case when a defense witnesses appeared to flip. Keyes thought he now had a direct eyewitness account of the conspiracy conducted by McPherson, Kennedy, and Ormiston to defeat justice by manufacturing false evidence. The chief witness against McPherson was now Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff. Based on her testimony, Keyes ordered a new grand jury investigation.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, (United Press) McPherson case has New Phase, May Free Aimee Mrs. Wiseman, Witness For State Faces Perjury; Number 49, December 29, 1926, p. 1.</ref>\n\nLorraine Wiseman-Sielaff introduced herself to McPherson and declared she was in Carmel as a nurse for her twin sister who was Ormiston's mistress; because the twins somewhat physically resembled McPherson, they were being misidentified as the evangelist. McPherson embraced Wiseman-Sielaff as an important witness who would exonerate her, and for a time she was a guest at the Angelus Temple parsonage. Kenneth Ormiston also signed a letter around September 8 that his companion was a sister of Wiseman-Seilaff, confirming her initial story. Later, Wiseman-Sielaff's was caught for passing bad checks and blamed it on her twin sister.<ref>Mavity, Nancy Barr \"Sister Aimee;\" (Doubleday, Doran, Incorporated, 1931) p. 271.</ref> When her story became untenable, she requested that the Angelus Temple post her bail, but they refused. Wiseman-Sielaff then said McPherson paid her to tell that story about what happened at Carmel-by-the-Sea and assist in hiring someone to pose as \"Miss X.\"  She was charged as a defendant in the case in November because she admitted her alleged role as an alibi for McPherson at Carmel and sided with the prosecution for immunity.\n\n[[File:LAPL BabeDaniels withHusband00021719.jpg|thumb|Harry Melosh and his wife, \"Babe\" Daniels, who was another \"Miss X\" in the McPherson case.|324x324px]]\nAs the grand jury inquiry progressed, Wiseman-Sielaff implicated one of McPherson's lawyers, Roland Rich Woolley, for inappropriate conduct when they lived in another state where she said they went to school together. The accusations forced Woolley from the case. Eventually it was proven Wiseman-Sielaff lied about the relationship, the lawyer Woolley gave evidence he had not met Wiseman-Sielaff until August 15, 1926.<ref>Hardy Impeachment; p. 997.</ref>   According to Woolley who was visiting a judge in his office at [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] on August 15; Wiseman-Sielaff and Virla Kimball, her twin sister,  voluntarily appeared there and signed an affidavit attesting that she and her sister were at Carmel-by-the-Sea with Kenneth Ormiston.   A cab driver confirmed the presence of the two women there. It was purported by the defense Kimball might have been Ormiston's \"Miss X.\"  On May 19, the date Ormiston and the mystery woman appeared at the cottage, it was confirmed Kimball was at nearby [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] filing for divorce. She also admitted to being [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] on August 15; but was not in the judge's office, stating she did not sign any such affidavit and threatened to sue McPherson if she were drawn into \"this horrible case.\"<ref>''The Miami News''(Associated Press)October 21, 1926.</ref><ref>Mavity, pp. 273-274.</ref> Wiseman-Sielaff inserted yet another sister as \"Miss X\" into the inquiry, Rachel Wells of [[Philadelphia]], as the person who actually signed the affidavit.<ref>''Lawrence Journal-World'' (Associated Press)Says Mrs. Kimball Signed Affidavit; October 21, 1926; p. 1.</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, another woman came forward, Babe Daniels, 20; of Chicago, IL; stating she was \"Miss X\" at Carmel; giving some the impression the prosecution was now awash in \"Miss X's.\" Later, she claimed being in on McPherson plot working with Wiseman-Sielaff with the promise of never having to worry about money again.

However, when asked to produce the memorandum book for examination, Wiseman-Sielaff said she had destroyed the book.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, Defense Witness in Evangelist Case Begin to Appear, Other side of Mystery to have Chance to Present Case; Number 277, October 15, 1926; p. 1.</ref> Her testimony became more inconsistent as she was further queried in December.

All three were already rumored to have inappropriate connections to the local underworld, with Ryan receiving an affidavit regarding his role in helping to facilitate protection rackets by acquitting defendants.<ref name=\"Cox, p.126\">Cox, p. 126.</ref>  Vice in general was readily flourishing under Keyes and he legalized slot machines which was later rescinded by his successor.

The defense contended both Ryan and his father-in-law, Captain Herman Cline, neglected their duty by disregarding evidence unearthed by border authorities that substantiated the evangelist\u2019s version of her re-appearance.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, Number 286, Aimee Defense accuses Ryan of Neglect of Duty; October 26, 1926, p. 1.</ref> The declaration by W. A. Gabrielson, chief of police of Monterey, said that \"Mr. Ryan's conduct of this case was most unethical\" referring to the methods Ryan used, among them entering the cottage in Carmel-by-the-Sea; without a warrant, and without any local official present. Of particular interest among the seized pieces of evidence was a medicine bottle; because it was dated May 25, 1926 and inside the timeframe Ormiston and \"Miss X\" occupied the cottage. Again without warrant, demands were then made of the druggist and prescribing doctor about the medicine's user.<ref>Hardy trial, p. 444.</ref>  As it turned out, the bottle belonged to the landlord, H. C. Benedict, and contained a \"commonplace preparation.\"  Keyes, thought all the evidence obtained at Carmel-by-the-Sea was too vague for a successful prosecution for perjury and was ready to quit the case. Ryan met with his superior Prosecutor Keyes and presented his \"ace in the hole evidence\" for continuance at Carmel-by-the-Sea. What Ryan offered was in the form of a receipt for a telegram said by him to be in McPherson's handwriting, signed by her at the Carmel cottage with two related witness identifications.<ref name=\"Hardy trial p. 1122\">Hardy trial, p. 1122.</ref>\n\nWithout fingerprints, Keyes was unconvinced there was sufficient evidence; and early August, ordered witness subpoenas to be suspended along with any further investigation at Carmel-by-the Sea.<ref name=\"Hardy trial p. 1122\"/> However, Ryan went over the head of his superior, and publicly announced the mystery solved and the case over, that the kidnapping was a ruse.<ref>''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle''; Mystery solved; Deputy Satisfied Evangelist Arrived at Carmel Day After Alleged Abduction; July 27, 1926; p. 7.</ref>  It was then expected more would be done with the inquiry.

On August 22, Cline was jailed for drunk driving after running into another car with his police vehicle.<ref>Cox, p. 127.</ref>  Considering his role in the grand jury inquiry, that he should be found in such a condition during Prohibition, was especially disconcerting to the Angelus Temple. Their complaints forced the Los Angeles police department to act and Cline was removed from the case. A period author scolded the Temple for their reaction. Nancy Barr Mavity, an early McPherson biographer; wrote of the [[drunk driving]] incident \"an error not altogether unprecedented to members of the police departments as to other human beings.\"<ref>Mavity, p. 141.</ref>\n\n===District Attorney Asa Keyes ===\n[[File:LAPL AsaKeyesHearing00022002.jpg|thumb|Scene in Judge Blake's courtroom during the hearing of Aimee Semple McPherson.

He was once a featured speaker at the Angelus Temple and at the time Mildred Kennedy, McPherson's mother; considered him a fair and just man.<ref name=\"Cox, p. 197\"/> Overall, McPherson enjoyed a favorable relationship with law enforcement and after the 1926 grand jury investigations were over, police were directing destitute people to the Angelus Temple's commissary for help. That she should have become a target, as she saw it, of such an intense legal smear puzzled her, and she framed it in the context that the Los Angeles prosecution was being controlled by diabolical forces seeking to bring herself and the Angelus Temple to ruin.<ref>''The San Bernardino County Sun;'' July 10, 1926; p. 2.</ref>  Biographer Daniel Mark Epstein explained Keyes was a public servant, responding to the pressures of many in the Los Angeles constituency who thought McPherson was making their city a laughingstock.<ref>Epstein, p. 300-301.</ref>\n\nSources in the Temple as per Raymond Cox, his own opinion and those of her lawyers, was that Keyes sought to elevate himself as an invincible prosecutor.<ref>Cox, p. 8.</ref> Keyes conducted the grand jury inquiry in such a way that afforded the evangelist most detrimental public exposure possible, including releasing details of a prosecution witness's testimony to the press; while honoring the code of grand jury secrecy only when it came to the defense side.<ref>Cox, p. 169.</ref>  He was known for winning convictions, but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by California's state governor, Friend Richardson. The governor reminded prosecutor Keyes it was his duty to seek justice not convictions, as currently the prosecution office seemed more interested in making a record than they were in acquitting the innocent. Richardson understood pardons for the same district attorney could occur once or even twice under an administration but six times was inconceivable.<ref>The San Bernardino County Sun Saturday September 25, 1926, page 1.</ref> \n[[File:LAPL AsaKeys00028123.jpg|thumb|left|District Attorney Asa Keyes]]\n\nAfter months of testimony and investigation Keyes lacked evidence he so earnestly sought to successfully prosecute the McPherson party in a jury trial. Therefore, on January 1927, he asked for case dismissal. He said, referring to his own side, he was through with perjured testimony, fake evidence and ...he had been duped and a (juried) trial against McPherson would be a futile persecution.<ref>Sutton, p. 136.</ref> After so much media buildup, it was wondered by some what McPherson did to force the abandonment of the \"airtight\" case against her. Keyes himself came under scrutiny.\n\nAlternate theories circulated about the real reason for the dismissal. One story, purportedly from a secret FBI file, conveyed newspaper tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]], was blackmailed by the evangelist who threatened to publicize a story she heard about him murdering movie producer [[Thomas H. Ince]] in 1924; and for being in an adulterous affair with actress [[Marion Davies]]. Hearst, fearing that such stories could damage his reputation, then pressured Keyes to drop the case.<ref>Sutton, p. 139.</ref> These incidents, though were previously part of the public record. Thomas Ince reportedly died of by heart failure brought on by acute indigestion and already there was a run of news gossip concerning Hearst and speculated suspicious circumstances surrounding Ince's death.

In an interview, as released by a newspaper, he stated seeing three physicians leaving the Carmel cottage late one night. The names of the three doctors, prominent citizens of Carmel, were published. A defense lawyer stated this gave weight to rumor that the ten day visit was for an abortion. The news article created the belief the three prominent citizens of Carmel made an unprofessional call and participated in felonious conduct. The office records of a San Francisco physician suspected of being an abortionist were also ransacked by newspaper representatives. The defense chided the witness as an inexperienced youth giving a thoughtless and false statement. McPherson's near death medical operation in 1914, which prevented her from having more children, was already part of the public record. When challenged about the abortion claim with a request to pay for the medical exam to prove it, the newspaper which printed the story backed down.<ref>Hardy Impeachment, p. 444.</ref><ref name=\"Mavity, p. 144\"/><ref name=\"Epstein, p. 74\">Epstein, p. 74.</ref>\n\nProsecution witness retired engineer Ralph Hershey, was described in some papers as a star witness for the state, however, different testimony in court was given than what was reported he would give.

He was forced to stop his machine until they walked around.<ref>The Evening Independent (United News); September 23, 1926; p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen he got to court in September, however, his story did not include Ormiston or stopping his car. Hershey explained while driving, he saw a woman approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} away near a street corner wearing a tight, low hat. He later visited a friend and they agreed the woman was a local resident; who sold that friend his house. Hershey spelled the name of the local woman for the lawyer cross-examining him. Two and a half months later, after a newsman interviewed him, Hersey decided instead the woman was the evangelist. To confirm his identification, on August 8, he traveled to the Angelus Temple and at a distance of around {{convert|100|ft|m}}, he saw Mrs. McPherson.

It was passed on to the police and later discovered to be missing from their locked evidence files in October. The district attorney's office claimed the missing note was written in \"disguised handwriting\" to help support the plot of McPherson being kidnapped. Because he was in San Francisco on May 24 and 25; and the handwriting and language were those of an \"educated person,\" Kenneth Ormiston was the purported author and this claim was passed on to the press. Photstats previously taken of the note were available to the state; though, nothing in court was presented actually tying Ormiston to the document.<ref>Santa Ana Register(Santa Ana, California), $500,000 Letter Believed Stolen From Files of L.

On July 4, a typewriter placed in storage in a federal building could not be located when it was later sought to test its keys against a sampling of one of the ransom notes demanding $500,000 received by the Angelus Temple.

The much published grocery slips, found at the Carmel-by-the-Sea cottage and asserted by the prosecution to be in McPherson's handwriting; mysteriously disappeared from the courtroom in early August. They were last seen being examined by a juror who left the courtroom on a break.

L. Mencken |publisher=Ralphmag.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref> \n \nIn the McPherson case, [[H.&nbsp;L. Mencken]] observed the grand jury proceedings becoming quite public. A vocal critic of McPherson,<ref name=\"ralphmag1\"/> Mencken wrote of her, \"For years she toured the [[Bible Belt]] in a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], haranguing the morons nightly, under canvas. It was a depressing life, and its usufructs were scarcely more than three meals a day. The town [he refers to Los Angeles] has more morons in it than the whole State of [[Mississippi]], and thousands of them had nothing to do save gape at the movie dignitaries and go to revivals\".<ref name=\"ralphmag1\"/> Mencken had been sent to cover the trial and there was every expectation he would continue his searing critiques against the evangelist. Instead, he came away impressed with McPherson and disdainful of the unseemly nature of the prosecution.<ref>Sutton, pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nH. L. Mencken determined the evangelist was being persecuted by two powerful groups. The \"town clergy\" which included Rev. [[Robert P. Shuler]], disliked her, for among other things, poaching their \"customers\" and for the perceived sexual immorality associated with Pentecostalism. Her other category of enemies were \"the Babbits\", the power elite of California. McPherson's strong stand on Bible fundamentalism was not popular with them, especially after taking a stand during the 1925 Scopes trial which gave \"science a bloody nose.\" In addition McPherson was working to put a Bible in every public school classroom and to forbid the teaching of evolution. ''[[The Argonaut]]'', a San Francisco newspaper, warned these actions made her a threat to the entire state which could place \"California on intellectual parity with Mississippi and Tennessee.\" Mencken later wrote: \"The trial, indeed, was an orgy typical of the half-fabulous California courts. The very officers of justice denounced her riotously in the Hearst papers while it was in progress.\"<ref name=\"ralphmag1\"/>\n\n===Theories and rebuttals===\n\nThe Los Angeles prosecution office purported McPherson left the beach with Kenneth Ormiston and stayed with him at Carmel-by-the-Sea for 10 days. Because they were almost identified by a reporter who stopped their car, the two fled California at the end of May, holed up somewhere for most of June; then made their way through Arizona to Mexico where she was dropped off outside of Agua Prieta.\n\nTelegraph operator William Blevins supplanted this theory when he declared he identified McPherson from photographs. He compared handwriting from his logs to samples printed in the newspapers from the grocery slips found at the Carmel-by-the-Sea cottage yard. He said she came into his office at Gila Bend, Arizona, on June 15 and sent a message to Tucson, Arizona; saying an automobile had broken down and she was taking a train. The prosecution confirmed his findings, and subpoenaed two more local witnesses who claimed they saw the same woman; and announced it in the news.\n[[File:LAPLgroceryslips00028129.jpg|thumb|Two fragments of the much publicized controversial grocery slips which were found at the Carmel cottage of Kenneth G. Ormiston and the mysterious \"Miss X.\"  Printed in the newspapers, the prosecution thought they had matched the slips to Aimee Semple McPherson's handwriting traced to a telegraph log in Gila Bend, Arizona, at a time she claimed to have been held by kidnappers. Another woman, Gail X. Koontz, was discovered to have signed the log.]]\n\nThe defense had a surprise witness, one the angry prosecution tried to prevent from appearing as she was presented out of turn at the inquiry. Stymied by objections from the prosecuting attorney, she was effectively silenced until Judge Samuel R. Blake intervened and allowed her to speak. The wife of an airman stationed in the Philippines, Mrs. Gail X. Koontz, said it was she, and not the evangelist, who sent a telegram from Gila Bend to Tucson on June 15. After withdrawing their much publicized witnesses, the prosecution continued to offer theories. However, they had nothing to present in court to establish McPherson's whereabouts anytime during the three weeks prior to her reappearance at Douglas, Arizona.<ref>''Healdsburg Tribune'', Number 278, \"Prosecution seeks to prevent defense Witnesses Testimony\", October 16, 1926; p. 1.</ref><ref>''St. Petersburg Times''; October 7, 1926; p. 1.</ref><ref>''Santa Cruz Evening News''; October 16, 1926; p. 1.</ref>\n\nA commentary published in an Ohio newspaper explored the situation. It did not help the prosecution's case in their claim that Ormiston and McPherson had been madly in love since Ormiston was absent from Los Angeles five months prior to the evangelist's disappearance. Also, Ormiston was being divorced by his wife, the pair could have gotten married. That she would choose to jeopardize her 2 million-dollar establishment that took great effort to create and undermine her career as a credible religious leader of 30,000 faithful followers to travel about the coast disguised in googles and a cap made no sense. If such an excursion were desired, there were easier and alternative methods she could have used.<ref>''The Journal News'' (Hamilton, Ohio); November 13, 1926; p. 59.</ref>\n\nOther theories and [[innuendo]] were rampant on what actually occurred, and also without evidence to establish credibility: that she had run off with some other lover, had gone off to have an [[abortion]], was taking time to heal from [[plastic surgery]], or had staged a [[publicity stunt]].

McKinley who was trusted by the kidnappers because he was blind. In May and again in June, two men, Miller and Wilson, aliases for \"Steve\" and the unnamed assailant of the McPherson complaint, allegedly approached him then made an offer to return Aimee Semple McPherson for $25,000. They told him a rubber mask was briefly used on McPherson when taking her and the drug was laced with one quarter grain (16&nbsp;mg) of morphine insuring she was \"doped\" safely and quickly. They were given four questions passed to McKinley from Kennedy that only her daughter knew to prove the men actually had her. Mildred Kennedy also gave McKinley $1,000 to assist him in his work. A ransom note was relayed and given to the police who in disguise, visited a hotel lobby drop site as a precaution in case it was genuine. No results were forthcoming and the note dismissed as fraudulent. Another ransom note demanding $500,000 was sent to the Angelus Temple with two of the questions correctly answered. McPherson later recalled an incident from her captivity when two of the kidnappers returned annoyed from an errand at a hotel stating they recognized the detectives positioned there and left. She also said they asked her personal questions and once she realized what they were doing and refused to answer further. She thought as the $500,000 being asked for her return was way too much, the Temple did not have it. One of them then burned her with his cigar in an attempt to get the other two questions answered. They threatened to take a finger if their ransom note did not work. Some days later, McPherson escaped.\n\n''\n[[File:LAPLMorris McKinley00021705.jpg|thumb|left| Attorney R. A. McKinley and his secretary, Bernice Morris. The blind Long Beach attorney was killed in an automobile accident and had claimed to have been approached by the alleged McPherson kidnappers in a deal for ransom.|599x599px]]\n''\nAfter McPherson's return to Los Angeles, McKinley promised to obtain information which would prove to the court kidnappers had indeed held her during the disappearance. Since McKinley had a good reputation,<ref>Hardy Impeachment, p. 1078.</ref> Kennedy, McPherson, and Judge Carlos Hardy, continued to work with him. A car accident in August, though, claimed his life. McKinley's sudden death, Mildred Kennedy thought, was peculiar, occurring as it did just before he was ready to reveal some important piece of evidence. His death was considered a serious blow to McPherson's case. His secretary, Miss Bernice Morris, however, testified for the prosecution stating she did not believe there were any alleged kidnappers. She had respect for her late boss, Mr. McKinley, though on the stand was forced to consider either he was in on the plot to manufacture evidence or an unwitting dupe. The prosecution purported the McPherson party sent at least two persons posing as the kidnappers to fool McKinley and secure his testimony lending credibility to the kidnapping story. This theory, as one biographer, Nancy Barr Mavity pointed out, had serious issues since it introduced two extra persons into the scam increasing the likelihood of exposure.<ref>Mavity, p. 107-109.</ref>\n\nBernice Morris also stated she had a photo made up of persons posing as the kidnappers and disguised them based on McPherson description. McPherson was shown the image represented to her as an actual photo of her assailants. Allegedly, McPherson's reaction to it was as a genuine identification. Since only actors were in the image, Morris took it as admission McPherson was penetrating a fraud by identifying them as her captors. McPherson denied Morris' contention, the subjects in the photo were in heavy shadow and the expletive Morris claimed she used when seeing the photo, was one not known to have been said by the evangelist in times of surprise.<ref>The Waco News-Tribune; June 24, 1926; p. 2.</ref><ref>Hardy transcripts p. 732.</ref><ref>Lately, Thomas The Vanishing Evangelist: the Aimee Semple McPherson Kidnapping Affair (Viking Press, 1959) p. 26.</ref><ref name=\"Cox, pp. 17\u201318\"/><ref name=\"Epstein, pp. 295, 312\"/> Bernice Morris continued with other damaging testimony, however, the defense was only allowed by the judge to minimally cross examine her. To check her credibility, McPherson lawyers asked for the release of McKinley's transcribed statement, which was earlier given to the DA's office before his death. The lawyers wanted to determine if any of it confirmed his secretary's story, or even if his testimony matched what McKinley was telling the Temple about his work. Of particular interest to the defense was what the transcripts in question said about a trip McKinley and his secretary, Bernice Morris; made to San Francisco in mid-August to meet with one of the alleged kidnappers. The prosecution refused, stating those documents were irrelevant and the judge, Samuel R. Blake; said it was outside his power to compel their release.<ref>Cox, p. 206.</ref>\n\nAnother person, employee of the Southern Pacific Engineering Department on September 26, made a statement Miss Morris was actually Mrs. Bernice Morris Allcorn Simpson, implying she was involved in a homosexual relationship. Living with Morris and passed off as her sister, was an 18 year old teenager. A McPherson lawyer told of an anonymous call coming into his office about Morris being pressured by a Los Angeles detective. Unless she gave testimony disparaging of the evangelist, Morris' lesbian relationship would be publicly exposed. McPherson and her mother jointly declared their faith in McKinley's work and that Miss Morris was being coerced to say things she knew that were not true.<ref>Cox, 148-149.</ref>\n[[File:LAPL Murchison 00021985.jpg|thumb|right|Sergeant Alonzo Murchison of Douglas, Arizona, illustrating on a blackboard the events concerning Aimee Semple McPherson in the courtroom of Judge Samuel R. Blake on October 7, 1926|496x496px]]\n\nAccording to Judge Carlos Hardy, the police were doing little in looking for kidnappers; instead treating her story as false. Mildred Kennedy, therefore, hired the [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns Detective Agency]] to look for evidence supporting their side of the story. \nSince the manager of the agency, J.W. Buchanan, did not want to report to a woman, Judge Hardy handled the details of the investigation. Rumors about several sets of \"Steves\" and \"Roses\" associated in criminal activities quickly turned up. One initially promising lead came from a convict who overheard fellow prisoners talk about the kidnapping as an actual event and involving a specific Steve, Rose and Frank who indicated a lot of money could be made kidnapping and ransoming McPherson. However, that particular Rose was discovered to have been dead and Steve in prison prior to McPherson's disappearance. \"Frank\" was still at large.<ref>Hardy Impeachment, pp. 109, 2217.</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 1926, an ''El Paso Herald'' reporter asked [[Emil Lewis Holmdahl]], an American infantryman turned soldier of fortune, if he had been involved in the alleged kidnapping of famous California evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Holmdahl, who fought extensively in earlier Latin American turmoil wars and was cleared by a Mexican judge as a suspect in the February 6, 1926 theft of [[Pancho Villa]]'s head, enigmatically replied regarding McPherson, \"Well, maybe I did and maybe I didn't.\" In contrast, unless intoxicated, he always emphatically denied participating in a grave robbery that stole Villa's head.<ref>Meed, Douglas V. \"Soldier of Fortune--Adventuring in Latin America and Mexico with Emil Lewis Holmdahl,\" Halcyon Press Limited, 2003, p. 191.</ref>\n\nOn October 8, police sergeant of Douglas Arizona, Alonzo B.

The couple had registered frequently under the name of Mr. and Mrs. J. Stone at the Gladstone Hotel, in Douglas. \"Steve\" placed a car in a Douglas garage in June 16. The woman was identified as Rose McBridge, a nurse. A Los Angeles special investigator later believed Steve to be H. M.

Note: In 1929 the California state senate conducted an impeachment trial of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carlos S. Hardy for providing legal aid to McPherson, violating the rules of office. McPherson was called to testify, but little interest was shown in prosecuting Hardy. The same witnesses and other persons from the earlier 1926 grand jury trial appeared, and McPherson was again in the headlines, being investigated. The impeachment trial cost another $50,000 (about US $660,000 in 2012), presumably borne largely by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', with the exception of the $25,000 (about US $330,000 in 2012) taxpayer money it cost to print the 1,300 page trial transcript. McPherson had to endure the same humiliation she had endured in the 1926 trial, when the discussion was primarily about her hair, legs, and morals. Charges against Hardy were dropped and the state assembly instead called for Los Angeles prosecutors to reopen the case to criminally charge McPherson. The Los Angeles offices declined.</ref> Journalist Morrow Mayo noted it was the last chance in California to \"ruin that red-headed sorceress\", and \"she is free to serve the Lord until the Marines are called out.\" <ref>Sutton, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe tale was later satirized in a song performed by [[Pete Seeger]] called \"The Ballad of Aimee McPherson,\" with lyrics claiming the kidnapping had been unlikely because a hotel love nest revealed \"the dents in the mattress fitted Aimee's [[Buttocks|caboose]].\"\n\nThe [[Court of Historical Review and Appeal]] in San Francisco, which holds no legal authority, is made up of members of the bench who examine and retry historical cases and controversies. In April 1990, a decision was handed down regarding the matter of McPherson's kidnapping story. George T. Choppelas, the then presiding judge of the San Francisco Municipal Court, ruling for the Court of Historical Review, found the issues involved both serious and fascinating. He concluded that \"there was never any substantial evidence to show that her story was untrue. She may not have been a saint, but she certainly was no sinner, either.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-09/local/me-2159_1_sister-aimee |title=Faithful of 'Sister Aimee' Say Mock Court Has Redeemed Her - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=October 9, 1990 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Aimee Semple McPherson]]\n[[Category:Kidnappings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Kidnapped American people]]\n[[Category:Grand juries in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name             = Aimee Semple McPherson\n|image            = File:ASM Grover trim.jpg\n|image_size       = \n|caption          = Prior to her 1926 reported kidnapping, Aimee Semple McPherson was little known outside of Southern California.

She reappeared in Mexico five weeks later, stating she had escaped from kidnappers holding her for ransom there. Her disappearance, reappearance and subsequent court inquiries regarding the allegation that the kidnapping story was a hoax carried out to conceal a tryst with a lover precipitated a media frenzy that changed the course of McPherson's career.\n\n==Disappearance off Venice Beach==\n\nOn May 18, 1926, McPherson went with her secretary to Ocean Park Beach north of [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]] to swim. Soon after arriving, McPherson was nowhere to be found. It was thought she had drowned.\n[[File:LAPLMcPherson BeachDisappearance.jpg|thumb|Hosts of followers of Aimee Semple McPherson gathered on the beach at Ocean Park in 1926 when she was first believed to have drowned. Here they watch as the surf was being dragged in a hunt for her body.|399x399px]]\n\nMcPherson was scheduled to hold a service that day; her mother Minnie Kennedy preached the sermon instead, saying at the end, \"Sister is with Jesus,\" sending parishioners into a tearful frenzy. [[Mourner]]s crowded Venice Beach and the commotion sparked days-long [[mass media|media]] coverage fueled in part by [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'' and a stirring poem by [[Upton Sinclair]] to commemorate the tragedy. Daily updates appeared in newspapers across the country and parishioners held day-and-night seaside [[vigil]]s. One parishioner drowned while searching for the body, and a diver died of [[Hypothermia#Water immersion|exposure]].\n\nKenneth G. Ormiston, the [[engineer]] for [[KXOL-FM|KFSG]], had taken other assignments around late December 1925 and left his job at the Temple.<ref>Cox, Raymond L. The Verdict is In, 1983. pp. 37\u201338.</ref>  Newspapers later linked McPherson and Ormiston, who was seen driving up the coast with an unidentified woman. Some believed McPherson and Ormiston, who was married, had become romantically involved and had run off together.\n\nMcPherson's children, Roberta Star Semple and Rolf McPherson, were scrutinized by suspicious news reporters trying to ascertain their degree of distraughtness. Roberta hid in the basement of her parsonage home as news reporters entered the building and began searching though McPherson's room and belongings looking for clues to her whereabouts.<ref>Epstein, pp. 295.</ref>  Rolf, who had been boarding in a remote farmhouse for the past three years, was besieged by reporters who heard a rumor he might have talked to his missing mother by telephone.<ref>Mavity, Nancy Barr \"Sister Aimee\" (Doubleday Doran, 1931), p. 103.</ref>\n\n===Sighting claims===\n[[File:ASM Edmonton.jpg|thumb|left|During the disappearance of Aimee Semple McPherson, from May 18 to June 23, 1926, there were many sighting claims. Canadian officials thought they had the evangelist, as attested to by three investigators, however, it turned out to be another woman.]]\nAfter her disappearance from the beach, many sightings of Aimee Semple McPherson were recorded.<ref>Hardy Trial, p. 1196.</ref> Immediately, there was a report of her driving away from the beach in her Angelus Temple uniform, as witnessed by a Culver City detective.<ref>Madera Tribune, Number 16, May 19, 1926, p. 1.</ref> However, this later was confirmed to be a parishioner in uniform: a dark cape and tie over a white nurse's dress, typical of what many female members wore.<ref>Cox, p. 15.</ref>  McPherson \"sightings\" were abundant, as many as 16 in different cities and other locations on the same day.<ref>Cox, p. 33-34.</ref>\n\nThe Angelus Temple received letters and calls claiming knowledge on the missing McPherson. One message stated McPherson was gone for a much needed rest and would be back July 16. Another, given by a spiritualist, indicated that while in a trance she had seen McPherson bound and apparently in distress in a cabin.<ref>''Reading Eagle,'' Saw Woman in Trance(Reading PA); July 18, 1926; p. 1.</ref>\n\nOn June 5, newspaper headlines announced McPherson had been found in Canada, as stated in a telegram message sent by authorities. The sender of the telegram knew McPherson from a revival meeting in Toronto, Canada. Tracked by three detectives, a woman reported to have been the missing evangelist was found in Edmonton, Alberta; she had arrived there in a Studebaker via Calgary, followed by another car. The woman checked into the Corona hotel and it was reported she was \"positively identified\" by the three operators as the revivalist. It was only after the woman was picked up by Canadian authorities and gave proof of her identity as someone else that the sighting report was rescinded on June 7.<ref>Madera Tribune, (United Press) Mrs. Semple McPherson is located at Edmonton by Canadian Authorities; Number 30, June 5, 1926; p. 1.</ref><ref>Madera Tribune,(United Press) Report Woman Seen in Canada Proves to Be False; Number 31, June 7, 1926; p. 1.</ref>  During the period of her disappearance, while there were \"various and voluminous claims,\" of McPherson sightings, none at all came from Carmel-by-the-Sea, a California town that would later dominate the headlines for such sightings.<ref>Hardy trial, p. 482.</ref>\n\n===Ransom demands===\n\nSeveral ransom notes and other similar communications were sent to the Temple, some of which were relayed to the police, who ultimately dismissed them as fraudulent. For a time, Mildred Kennedy, McPherson's mother, offered a $25,000<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">about US $315,000.00 in 2012 dollars</ref> reward for information leading to the return of her daughter.\n\nThe ransom demands included a handwritten note by the \"Revengers\" who wanted $500,000<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">about US $6.3 million in 2012.</ref> and another for $25,000<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> conveyed by a blind lawyer, Russell A.

Kennedy regarded the notes as hoaxes, believing her daughter dead.<ref>Cox, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> She set herself about the task of continuing to raise money for a needed church building expansion, which became part of an elaborate memorial service commemorating the evangelist's death.

Gonzales, alerted the leader of Agua Prieta, Presidente Ernesto Boubion, to see her. Boubion stated she grasped his wrist, trembled violently, and asked where she was. She looked ill and appeared agitated, and declined both food and drink. She was transported across the border to the Douglas, Arizona, police station and then the Douglas hospital. Her shoes were white with desert dust and her hands were covered with grime. A nurse picked some cactus spines from her legs and rubbed some preparation on a blistered toe. McPherson went on about protection for her 16-year-old daughter and warned her assailants had plans to make off with Mary Pickford and other celebrities.<ref>The Waco News-Tribune; Missing Woman Evangelist Escapes Captors; June 24, 1926 p. 2.</ref><ref>The San Bernardino County Sun; Evangelist's Version Clue Plot on Movie Stars is Told Friday, June 25, 1926; p. 1-2.</ref> At that time no one believed she was Aimee Semple McPherson, the missing Angelus Temple pastor.

When she went with them and looked in on the bundle in the back seat of an automobile, they shoved her into their car. At the same time a cloth was held over her face loaded with a sickly sweet substance, later speculated to be [[chloroform]] with an additive.[[File:Aimee Semple McPherson in DouglasAZHospital.jpg|thumbnail|right| After emerging from the Mexican desert, McPherson convalesces in a hospital with her family in Douglas, Arizona 1926.

A woman named \"Rose,\" who displayed professional nursing skills, looked after her. Held for a time in what was a boarded up room in a house that appeared to be an urban area, she was later moved to the remote shack in Mexico. Trying to elicit some personal information to prove they had her, one of her captors burned McPherson's hand with his cigar, but felt bad about it and stopped. McPherson's statement gave details on how she escaped the desert shack while her assailants were out on errands. She cut her bonds on a metal can lid, a technique she later successfully demonstrated several times before skeptical reporters,<ref>Thomas, ''Vanishing Evangelist'', p. 278.</ref> and climbed out the shack's back window. Using a mountain to navigate, she made her way north. She told how she used her garments to shield herself from the afternoon sun and carefully stepped around any shaggy bushes in her path. In the evening, lights from a town guided her to its streets. Terrified by the unexpected savagery of nearby barking dogs behind a fence, she entered the yard of a Mexican couple, R. R. Gonzales and his wife.<ref>McPherson, Aimee Semple, ''In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life'' (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927) p. 265.</ref> Her story was transmitted and transcribed across telegraph and phone lines becoming front-page international news.\n\nOn the way back to Los Angeles, the train was stopped and boarded by two men who claimed to have earlier seen McPherson during the time she stated she was kidnapped. One man, realizing a mistaken identity, apologized and excused himself after seeing her. However, in a much publicized scene, the other individual stated he had seen her at a Tucson, Arizona street corner four weeks earlier, in May. By his own admission, he had never seen the evangelist in person, only by photograph. The woman he saw in the street wore a tight, low fitting hat shading her eyes and walked in different gait than McPherson used. Yet for him it was those obscured eyes that confirmed his identification. McPherson wrote he was her first experience with such \"identifications,\" others of which were even \"more absurd,\" and \"all were flung to the world in newspaper headlines.\" Later, this witness was discarded as his sighting came at a time when McPherson was accused by Los Angeles prosecutors to have instead been in Carmel-by-the Sea, California.<ref>Cox, p. 94.</ref><ref>McPherson, Aimee Semple, ''In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life'' (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927) p. 39.</ref>\n\nFollowing her return to [[Los Angeles]] from Douglas, McPherson was greeted at the train station by 30,000\u201350,000 people, more than for almost any other personage.<ref name=\"Melton, J.

Many Los Angeles area churches were also annoyed. The divorcee McPherson had settled in their town and many of their parishioners were now attending her church, with its elaborate sermons that, in their view, diminished the dignity of the Gospel. The Chamber of Commerce, together with Reverend [[Robert P. Shuler]] leading the Los Angeles Church Federation, and assisted by the press and others, became an informal alliance to determine if her disappearance was caused by other than a kidnapping.<ref name=\"Epstein, p. 301\">Epstein, p. 301.</ref><ref name=\"Sutton, pp. 120\u2013122\">Sutton, pp. 120\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn response to an increasing undercurrent of doubt, the leadership of the Angelus Temple debated whether to let the matter drop or push for vindication. McPherson welcomed the opportunity for more publicity, since she saw it as a way to expose more people to her vision of Jesus Christ. Her mother, Mildred Kennedy, cynically thought the controversy might get away from them and become disruptive to the Temple's activities. Judge Carlos Hardy, an influential friend of the Temple and McPherson, decided to go to court to present their complaint, over the stern objections of  Kennedy and lawyers hired for advice.\n\n==Grand jury inquiries==\n\nThere were several phases of  grand jury inquiries regarding Aimee Semple McPherson, all conducted by Los Angeles District Attorney Asa Keyes. The first inquiry was about charging McPherson's kidnappers, with indictments against Steve Doe, Rose Doe, and John Doe,<ref>Shuler, Robert, ''Fighting Bob Shuler of Los Angeles'' Dog Ear Publishing, 2012 p. 178.</ref> convening on July 8, 1926, and adjourning on July 20, 1926. However, it became immediately apparent the evangelist was being interrogated from a viewpoint of hostile skepticism. Prosecutor Asa Keyes insinuated she was a charlatan who was run out of various cities during her revivals. McPherson offered to show news clippings to the contrary, attesting to the success of her work and requests for return visits. Annoyed, Keyes continued, focusing on the belief the disappearance was plot to elicit money for a memorial fund commemorating McPherson's death or for promotional purposes. Her sanity was also questioned: perhaps she had simply wandered off suffering from amnesia.<ref>Spiritual Leaders Aimee Semple McPherson; CHBiographies, epub 2-3 Infobase Learning, July 18, 2013.</ref>  The first inquiry ended with a determination that there was not enough evidence to charge either alleged kidnappers or the McPherson group for fraud.\n\nThe second inquiry, amidst frenzied publicity, started on August 3 in response to new developments suggesting that rather than being held by kidnappers, McPherson was cohabitating with her former employee Kenneth Ormiston in the resort town of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The inquiry stalled due to lack of evidence and ended by mid-August. Later, when a defense witness, Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff, sided with the prosecution as a betrayed co-plotter, another grand jury inquiry was ordered to begin in late September. Testimony and evidence from Carmel-by-the Sea was reintroduced by the prosecution, together with their new witness. Their intent was show proof of a conspiracy by the McPherson party to manufacture evidence in bolstering her kidnapping story. McPherson's defense team, previously overshadowed by publicity favoring the prosecution, was able to comprehensively explain their side of the case.\n\nA jury trial was scheduled for January, 1927, to charge the evangelist, her mother and several other defendants with criminal conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice. If convicted, the counts added up to maximum prison time of 42 years.<ref name=\"Sutton, pp. 133\u2013134\">Sutton, pp. 133\u2013134.</ref><ref name=\"Epstein, p. 312\">Epstein, p. 312, NOTE: The charges were a criminal conspiracy to commit acts injurious to public morals, to prevent and [[obstruction of justice|obstruct justice]], and to prevent the due administration of the laws, and of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to commit the crime of subordination of perjury.</ref><ref>The People vs. Aimee Semple McPherson, et al., Case CR 29181, January 10, 1927; Superior Court of Los Angeles County, County records and Archives</ref>  Further statements and information were taken from various witnesses ahead of the projected trial through early January 1927.\n\n===Escape through the desert===\n\n[[File:LAPLPresidente Ernesto Boubion00021695.jpg|thumb|left|Presidente Ernesto Boubion of Agua Prieta, Mexico, as per his translator William Appel and Aimee Semple McPherson, attempted to solicit $5000 from the evangelist in exchange for his favorable opinion of her reported kidnapping story.<ref>Corsicana Daily Sun; July 17, 1926; p. 1.</ref>]]The first inquiry started on July 8, 1926, with reading McPherson's statement into the record. Mildred Kennedy broke down and sobbed during the reading, which took most of a day to enter. Testimony continued with what allegedly happened in Mexico, though the most comprehensive portions, especially from the defense, came later in October.\n\nMcPherson's disappearance was concurrent with Mexico transforming itself into a secular socialist state, with religious restrictions that led up to the [[Cristero War]] of 1926\u20131929. Mexican officials immediately expressed that McPherson could not have been illegally taken onto their land. Even as the woman in the Arizona hospital was identified as the missing evangelist, Consul General of Mexico, George A. Lubert, announced that McPherson could not have been taken across the border against her will. He stressed the impossibility of smuggling a person across the border since it was patrolled with a \"strict watch\" by both nations.\n\nGovernor Abelardo Rodriguiz told the Associated Press he had assigned special police to all border towns immediately after the evangelist's disappearance and was positive she could not have been carried by force across the border. He was certain she had not been in either Mexicali or in any other part of Lower California since her disappearance May 18.<ref>The Scranton Republican; June 24, 1926; p. 2.</ref><ref>Mavity, p. 138.</ref> However, persons and objects being moved illegally between the US and Mexico was a known problem, with smugglers crossing guns along the length of the border.<ref>D\u00edaz, George T.

When McPherson returned to Mexico in early July 1926 to assist in looking for signs of her kidnappers, the Presidente wanted to see her privately. With his translator as the only other person in the room, Boubion took her aside, saying individuals were willing to pay him $5000 to cast doubt on her story, though he would back her statement if she paid him the money instead. McPherson wrote:\n\n{{cquote|<big>Here was a man making a proposition that if he was not paid so many American dollars, he would give a written statement to the effect that my experience never happened.... It was not the last time...that an unscrupulous person wanted to exact a toll to keep from lying. I walked out of the cafe hardly dignifying the swarthy plotter with an answer.

The prosecution invited the evangelist to visit Carmel, conveying that if she had nothing to hide, she should present herself to the witnesses for a proper identification.

On November 3, Judge Samuel R. Blake was to try the evangelist, her mother and several other defendants in a jury trial case in Los Angeles, set for mid-January 1927.

However, new developments continued afterwards. The prosecution wanted to question H. C. Benedict about the contents of a blue steamer trunk purportedly belonging to Ormiston confiscated in September, but the landlord of the cottage died in mid-November. Apart from affidavits and messages, Kenneth Ormiston still had not given testimony. More importantly, Wiseman-Sielaff appeared to be giving new information concerning the conspiracy implicating McPherson and her circle of friends and acquaintances.\n\nBy late December, the prosecution determined their new star witness, Wiseman-Sielaff, could no longer be a considered a credible witness. Without her, District Attorney Asa Keyes considered other evidence insufficient to continue prosecuting the case. Keyes submitted a document to have the case dismissed, conveying that without Wiseman-Sielaff's testimony, the alleged conspiracy was impossible to prove. He added \"Reputable witnesses have testified sufficiently concerning both the Carmel incident and the return of Mrs. McPherson from her so-called kidnapping adventure to enable her to be judged in the only court which has jurisdiction \u2014the court of public opinion.\"<ref>Thomas, Vanishing Evangelist; p. 320</ref> ''The Examiner'' newspaper reported that [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|Los Angeles district attorney]] [[Asa Keyes]] had dropped all charges against McPherson and associated parties on January 10, 1927.<ref>Sutton, p. 136.

No mention of the $800,000 is given by biographers of McPherson to include Thomas, Blumhofer, Sutton, Cox, or Epstein. No evidence for the commonly quoted lower figure of $30,000 is found; details and the source of the rumor ambiguous.</ref><ref>Author Stephen J.

Praeger Pub Text, Westport, Conn., 1999).\n\nIn late 1928, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury began looking into the possibility that Keyes had been bribed to drop charges against McPherson. An investigation was started and Keyes was acquitted (Shaefer, Silvia Anne; ''Aimee Semple Mcpherson'', Infobase Publishing, New York, 2004; p. 71). A November 13 ''United Press'' dispatch from London quotes the evangelist as saying: \"I never paid a penny. The reason I was freed was that the woman who made the charges confessed she had lied and had been hired to tell the story. With her confession, I was automatically released.\"  Journalist Rodger M. Grace comments the reality was more complex: Keyes, because of inconsistencies in Wiseman-Sielaff\u2019s account, could not vouch for the truthfulness of her testimony, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Albert Lee Stephens Sr. dismissed the charges. {{cite web|author=Roger M.

Holmdahl, who fought extensively in earlier Latin American turmoil wars and was cleared by a Mexican judge as a suspect in the February 6, 1926 theft of [[Pancho Villa]]'s head, enigmatically replied regarding McPherson, \"Well, maybe I did and maybe I didn't.\"  In contrast, unless intoxicated, he always emphatically denied participating in a grave robbery that stole Villa's head.</ref>  Therefore, anyone could still accuse her of a hoax without fear of slander charges and frequently did so.

On the evening of May 29, near Santa Barbara, a reporter tracked Ormiston's blue Chrysler sedan coupe, and flagged it down. After examining the driver and his female passenger, the reporter determined while the man was Ormiston, he could not identify the woman, \"Miss X,\" as McPherson.<ref>Beek, Hardy Impeachment, p. 397.</ref> As the result of the incident, a Santa Barbara Morning Press article headline later read: ''Road Watched for Ormiston and Evangelist''.<ref>Beek, Hardy Impeachment, p. 407.</ref>[[File:LAPLKenneth G Ormiston Blue Chrysler Sedan.jpeg|thumb|Kenneth G.

In response to the intense news coverage of a half a dozen or more witnesses suddenly alleging they saw McPherson there, Prosecutor Asa Keyes launched another manhunt for Ormiston. McPherson herself pleaded through the papers for Ormiston to clear the matter up. Annoyed, Ormiston sent a letter from New York to Asa Keyes denouncing the treatment received from newspapers and officials as \u201cnasty publicity and subsequent persecution by self-styled investigators,\" and that he had no intention of appearing before the Los Angeles grand jury.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, United Press ''Ormiston Peeved, Will Not Appear,'' Number 213, July 20, 1926, p. 1.</ref> He released a lengthy statement to the police and several newspapers.

Affably, amidst the flashbulbs of photographers, Ormiston accepted his served warrant. His bond was set at $2,500.<ref>Thomas, Vanishing, p. 315.</ref>\n\nOrmiston declined to answer any questions from the numerous reporters, stepped into Keyes office and typed out his statement. He desired not to complicate the situation since \"intrigue and hokum were as thick as San Francisco fog.\"  He maintained he was not at Carmel-by-the-Sea with Mrs. McPherson, stated he violated no conspiracy laws and was not afraid to face trial.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, Number 41, December 18, 1926 ''Ormiston is in Los Angeles to prove Innocence.

He determined other evidence at Carmel was too vague for a successful perjury prosecution against the defendants.<ref>Hardy impeachment; 886-887, p. 1123.</ref> An unexpected opportunity, though, invigorated the case when a defense witnesses appeared to flip. Keyes thought he now had a direct eyewitness account of the conspiracy conducted by McPherson, Kennedy, and Ormiston to defeat justice by manufacturing false evidence. The chief witness against McPherson was now Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff. Based on her testimony, Keyes ordered a new grand jury investigation.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, (United Press) McPherson case has New Phase, May Free Aimee Mrs. Wiseman, Witness For State Faces Perjury; Number 49, December 29, 1926, p. 1.</ref>\n\nLorraine Wiseman-Sielaff introduced herself to McPherson and declared she was in Carmel as a nurse for her twin sister who was Ormiston's mistress; because the twins somewhat physically resembled McPherson, they were being misidentified as the evangelist. McPherson embraced Wiseman-Sielaff as an important witness who would exonerate her, and for a time she was a guest at the Angelus Temple parsonage. Kenneth Ormiston also signed a letter around September 8 that his companion was a sister of Wiseman-Seilaff, confirming her initial story. Later, Wiseman-Sielaff's was caught for passing bad checks and blamed it on her twin sister.<ref>Mavity, Nancy Barr \"Sister Aimee;\" (Doubleday, Doran, Incorporated, 1931) p. 271.</ref> When her story became untenable, she requested that the Angelus Temple post her bail, but they refused. Wiseman-Sielaff then said McPherson paid her to tell that story about what happened at Carmel-by-the-Sea and assist in hiring someone to pose as \"Miss X.\"  She was charged as a defendant in the case in November because she admitted her alleged role as an alibi for McPherson at Carmel and sided with the prosecution for immunity.\n\n[[File:LAPL BabeDaniels withHusband00021719.jpg|thumb|Harry Melosh and his wife, \"Babe\" Daniels, who was another \"Miss X\" in the McPherson case.|324x324px]]\nAs the grand jury inquiry progressed, Wiseman-Sielaff implicated one of McPherson's lawyers, Roland Rich Woolley, for inappropriate conduct when they lived in another state where she said they went to school together. The accusations forced Woolley from the case. Eventually it was proven Wiseman-Sielaff lied about the relationship, the lawyer Woolley gave evidence he had not met Wiseman-Sielaff until August 15, 1926.<ref>Hardy Impeachment; p. 997.</ref>   According to Woolley who was visiting a judge in his office at [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] on August 15; Wiseman-Sielaff and Virla Kimball, her twin sister,  voluntarily appeared there and signed an affidavit attesting that she and her sister were at Carmel-by-the-Sea with Kenneth Ormiston.   A cab driver confirmed the presence of the two women there. It was purported by the defense Kimball might have been Ormiston's \"Miss X.\"  On May 19, the date Ormiston and the mystery woman appeared at the cottage, it was confirmed Kimball was at nearby [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] filing for divorce. She also admitted to being [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] on August 15; but was not in the judge's office, stating she did not sign any such affidavit and threatened to sue McPherson if she were drawn into \"this horrible case.\"<ref>''The Miami News''(Associated Press)October 21, 1926.</ref><ref>Mavity, pp. 273-274.</ref> Wiseman-Sielaff inserted yet another sister as \"Miss X\" into the inquiry, Rachel Wells of [[Philadelphia]], as the person who actually signed the affidavit.<ref>''Lawrence Journal-World'' (Associated Press)Says Mrs. Kimball Signed Affidavit; October 21, 1926; p. 1.</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, another woman came forward, Babe Daniels, 20; of Chicago, IL; stating she was \"Miss X\" at Carmel; giving some the impression the prosecution was now awash in \"Miss X's.\" Later, she claimed being in on McPherson plot working with Wiseman-Sielaff with the promise of never having to worry about money again. Prosecutor Keyes rejected Daniels' story \"as a tissue of lies\" and cut her loose with a stern rebuke to anyone else attempting such a fraud would be exposed by his office.\"<ref>Oakland Tribune, September 27, 1926 p. 3.</ref><ref>The Cornell Daily Sun, Volume 47, Number 5, September 25, 1926, p. 1.</ref> Criticism erupted and a news columnist wrote:<ref name=\"San Bernardino Sun 1926\"/>\n\n{{cquote|<big>Why not prosecute all perjurers, instead of devoting all his attention to one whom every attendant circumstance suggests isn't a perjurer at all, but simply telling the truth and making the prosecution ridiculous?</big>}}\n\nWiseman-Sielaff declared she made a note in her memorandum book regarding money sent, on behalf of McPherson, to Rachel Wells on August 4. However, when asked to produce the memorandum book for examination, Wiseman-Sielaff said she had destroyed the book.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, Defense Witness in Evangelist Case Begin to Appear, Other side of Mystery to have Chance to Present Case; Number 277, October 15, 1926; p. 1.</ref> Her testimony became more inconsistent as she was further queried in December.

All three were already rumored to have inappropriate connections to the local underworld, with Ryan receiving an affidavit regarding his role in helping to facilitate protection rackets by acquitting defendants.<ref name=\"Cox, p.126\">Cox, p. 126.</ref>  Vice in general was readily flourishing under Keyes and he legalized slot machines which was later rescinded by his successor.

Cross stated the shoes looked polished and cleaned up from when he first saw them.]]\nIn the Douglas hospital, as he helped to question the convalescing evangelist, Assistant Deputy District Attorney Joseph Ryan enthusiastically professed his faith in McPherson's story. He even said he could make the desert trip without scuffing or marking his commissary shoes.<ref>Thomas, ''Vanishing Evangelist,'' p. 125.</ref><ref>Cox, p. 68.</ref> Later, in Los Angeles, Ryan testified though, he knew McPherson was a \"fake and a hypocrite\" the first time he saw her in the hospital.<ref>Cox, Raymond, p. 83,</ref> Ryan was assistant to District Attorney Asa Keyes, and essentially did much of the legwork in building the case against McPherson. The defense contended both Ryan and his father-in-law, Captain Herman Cline, neglected their duty by disregarding evidence unearthed by border authorities that substantiated the evangelist\u2019s version of her re-appearance.<ref>Healdsburg Tribune, Number 286, Aimee Defense accuses Ryan of Neglect of Duty; October 26, 1926, p. 1.</ref> The declaration by W. A. Gabrielson, chief of police of Monterey, said that \"Mr. Ryan's conduct of this case was most unethical\" referring to the methods Ryan used, among them entering the cottage in Carmel-by-the-Sea; without a warrant, and without any local official present. Of particular interest among the seized pieces of evidence was a medicine bottle; because it was dated May 25, 1926 and inside the timeframe Ormiston and \"Miss X\" occupied the cottage. Again without warrant, demands were then made of the druggist and prescribing doctor about the medicine's user.<ref>Hardy trial, p. 444.</ref>  As it turned out, the bottle belonged to the landlord, H. C. Benedict, and contained a \"commonplace preparation.\"  Keyes, thought all the evidence obtained at Carmel-by-the-Sea was too vague for a successful prosecution for perjury and was ready to quit the case. Ryan met with his superior Prosecutor Keyes and presented his \"ace in the hole evidence\" for continuance at Carmel-by-the-Sea. What Ryan offered was in the form of a receipt for a telegram said by him to be in McPherson's handwriting, signed by her at the Carmel cottage with two related witness identifications.<ref name=\"Hardy trial p. 1122\">Hardy trial, p. 1122.</ref>\n\nWithout fingerprints, Keyes was unconvinced there was sufficient evidence; and early August, ordered witness subpoenas to be suspended along with any further investigation at Carmel-by-the Sea.<ref name=\"Hardy trial p. 1122\"/> However, Ryan went over the head of his superior, and publicly announced the mystery solved and the case over, that the kidnapping was a ruse.<ref>''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle''; Mystery solved; Deputy Satisfied Evangelist Arrived at Carmel Day After Alleged Abduction; July 27, 1926; p. 7.</ref>  It was then expected more would be done with the inquiry.

On August 22, Cline was jailed for drunk driving after running into another car with his police vehicle.<ref>Cox, p. 127.</ref>  Considering his role in the grand jury inquiry, that he should be found in such a condition during Prohibition, was especially disconcerting to the Angelus Temple. Their complaints forced the Los Angeles police department to act and Cline was removed from the case. A period author scolded the Temple for their reaction. Nancy Barr Mavity, an early McPherson biographer; wrote of the [[drunk driving]] incident \"an error not altogether unprecedented to members of the police departments as to other human beings.\"<ref>Mavity, p. 141.</ref>\n\n===District Attorney Asa Keyes ===\n[[File:LAPL AsaKeyesHearing00022002.jpg|thumb|Scene in Judge Blake's courtroom during the hearing of Aimee Semple McPherson.

He was once a featured speaker at the Angelus Temple and at the time Mildred Kennedy, McPherson's mother; considered him a fair and just man.<ref name=\"Cox, p. 197\"/> Overall, McPherson enjoyed a favorable relationship with law enforcement and after the 1926 grand jury investigations were over, police were directing destitute people to the Angelus Temple's commissary for help. That she should have become a target, as she saw it, of such an intense legal smear puzzled her, and she framed it in the context that the Los Angeles prosecution was being controlled by diabolical forces seeking to bring herself and the Angelus Temple to ruin.<ref>''The San Bernardino County Sun;'' July 10, 1926; p. 2.</ref>  Biographer Daniel Mark Epstein explained Keyes was a public servant, responding to the pressures of many in the Los Angeles constituency who thought McPherson was making their city a laughingstock.<ref>Epstein, p. 300-301.</ref>\n\nSources in the Temple as per Raymond Cox, his own opinion and those of her lawyers, was that Keyes sought to elevate himself as an invincible prosecutor.<ref>Cox, p. 8.</ref> Keyes conducted the grand jury inquiry in such a way that afforded the evangelist most detrimental public exposure possible, including releasing details of a prosecution witness's testimony to the press; while honoring the code of grand jury secrecy only when it came to the defense side.<ref>Cox, p. 169.</ref>  He was known for winning convictions, but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by California's state governor, Friend Richardson. The governor reminded prosecutor Keyes it was his duty to seek justice not convictions, as currently the prosecution office seemed more interested in making a record than they were in acquitting the innocent. Richardson understood pardons for the same district attorney could occur once or even twice under an administration but six times was inconceivable.<ref>The San Bernardino County Sun Saturday September 25, 1926, page 1.</ref> \n[[File:LAPL AsaKeys00028123.jpg|thumb|left|District Attorney Asa Keyes]]\n\nAfter months of testimony and investigation Keyes lacked evidence he so earnestly sought to successfully prosecute the McPherson party in a jury trial. Therefore, on January 1927, he asked for case dismissal. He said, referring to his own side, he was through with perjured testimony, fake evidence and ...he had been duped and a (juried) trial against McPherson would be a futile persecution.<ref>Sutton, p. 136.</ref> After so much media buildup, it was wondered by some what McPherson did to force the abandonment of the \"airtight\" case against her. Keyes himself came under scrutiny.\n\nAlternate theories circulated about the real reason for the dismissal. One story, purportedly from a secret FBI file, conveyed newspaper tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]], was blackmailed by the evangelist who threatened to publicize a story she heard about him murdering movie producer [[Thomas H. Ince]] in 1924; and for being in an adulterous affair with actress [[Marion Davies]]. Hearst, fearing that such stories could damage his reputation, then pressured Keyes to drop the case.<ref>Sutton, p. 139.</ref> These incidents, though were previously part of the public record. Thomas Ince reportedly died of by heart failure brought on by acute indigestion and already there was a run of news gossip concerning Hearst and speculated suspicious circumstances surrounding Ince's death. Davies was a companion to Hearst since 1917; previously enduring publicized scandals about it. Moreover, such scheming was contrary to McPherson's previously known behavior as attested to by others. Guido Orlando a promoter who made [[Greta Garbo]] a legend, wrote of McPherson: \"She was not a bigot, she did not pry into people's private lives,... She was in all the time I knew her incapable of malice toward anyone.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.americanpopularculture.com/archive/film/hearst_davies_2.htm |title = Film in American Popular Culture}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/44966%7C106932/Marion-Davies/ |title = Overview for Marion Davies}}</ref><ref>New York Times, December 4, 1924 as per Swanberg, W.

To maintain excited, continued public interest, she speculated, the newspapers let her original account give way to rain torrents of \"new spice and thrill\" stories about her being elsewhere \"with that one or another one.\"  It did not matter if the material was disproved or wildly contradictory. No correction or apology was given for the previous story as another, even more outrageous tale, took its place.<ref>McPherson, Aimee Semple, ''In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life'' (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927) p. 54.</ref>\n\nA newspaper editorial crossed the boundaries of publication decency for U.S. Postal Inspectors when 75 year old Abraham.

In an interview, as released by a newspaper, he stated seeing three physicians leaving the Carmel cottage late one night. The names of the three doctors, prominent citizens of Carmel, were published. A defense lawyer stated this gave weight to rumor that the ten day visit was for an abortion. The news article created the belief the three prominent citizens of Carmel made an unprofessional call and participated in felonious conduct. The office records of a San Francisco physician suspected of being an abortionist were also ransacked by newspaper representatives. The defense chided the witness as an inexperienced youth giving a thoughtless and false statement. McPherson's near death medical operation in 1914, which prevented her from having more children, was already part of the public record. When challenged about the abortion claim with a request to pay for the medical exam to prove it, the newspaper which printed the story backed down.<ref>Hardy Impeachment, p. 444.</ref><ref name=\"Mavity, p. 144\"/><ref name=\"Epstein, p. 74\">Epstein, p. 74.</ref>\n\nProsecution witness retired engineer Ralph Hershey, was described in some papers as a star witness for the state, however, different testimony in court was given than what was reported he would give.

He was forced to stop his machine until they walked around.<ref>The Evening Independent (United News); September 23, 1926; p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen he got to court in September, however, his story did not include Ormiston or stopping his car. Hershey explained while driving, he saw a woman approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} away near a street corner wearing a tight, low hat. He later visited a friend and they agreed the woman was a local resident; who sold that friend his house. Hershey spelled the name of the local woman for the lawyer cross-examining him. Two and a half months later, after a newsman interviewed him, Hersey decided instead the woman was the evangelist. To confirm his identification, on August 8, he traveled to the Angelus Temple and at a distance of around {{convert|100|ft|m}}, he saw Mrs. McPherson. Hersey explained it was the large, open, brilliant eyes which clenched the identification for him.

Constable Ash maintained the press withheld important facts from the public and even gave deliberate misinformation regarding the evangelist's kidnapping story.

It was passed on to the police and later discovered to be missing from their locked evidence files in October. The district attorney's office claimed the missing note was written in \"disguised handwriting\" to help support the plot of McPherson being kidnapped. Because he was in San Francisco on May 24 and 25; and the handwriting and language were those of an \"educated person,\" Kenneth Ormiston was the purported author and this claim was passed on to the press. Photstats previously taken of the note were available to the state; though, nothing in court was presented actually tying Ormiston to the document.<ref>Santa Ana Register(Santa Ana, California), $500,000 Letter Believed Stolen From Files of L.

On July 4, a typewriter placed in storage in a federal building could not be located when it was later sought to test its keys against a sampling of one of the ransom notes demanding $500,000 received by the Angelus Temple.

The much published grocery slips, found at the Carmel-by-the-Sea cottage and asserted by the prosecution to be in McPherson's handwriting; mysteriously disappeared from the courtroom in early August. They were last seen being examined by a juror who left the courtroom on a break.

L. Mencken |publisher=Ralphmag.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref> \n \nIn the McPherson case, [[H.&nbsp;L. Mencken]] observed the grand jury proceedings becoming quite public. A vocal critic of McPherson,<ref name=\"ralphmag1\"/> Mencken wrote of her, \"For years she toured the [[Bible Belt]] in a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], haranguing the morons nightly, under canvas. It was a depressing life, and its usufructs were scarcely more than three meals a day. The town [he refers to Los Angeles] has more morons in it than the whole State of [[Mississippi]], and thousands of them had nothing to do save gape at the movie dignitaries and go to revivals\".<ref name=\"ralphmag1\"/> Mencken had been sent to cover the trial and there was every expectation he would continue his searing critiques against the evangelist. Instead, he came away impressed with McPherson and disdainful of the unseemly nature of the prosecution.<ref>Sutton, pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nH. L. Mencken determined the evangelist was being persecuted by two powerful groups. The \"town clergy\" which included Rev. [[Robert P. Shuler]], disliked her, for among other things, poaching their \"customers\" and for the perceived sexual immorality associated with Pentecostalism. Her other category of enemies were \"the Babbits\", the power elite of California. McPherson's strong stand on Bible fundamentalism was not popular with them, especially after taking a stand during the 1925 Scopes trial which gave \"science a bloody nose.\" In addition McPherson was working to put a Bible in every public school classroom and to forbid the teaching of evolution. ''[[The Argonaut]]'', a San Francisco newspaper, warned these actions made her a threat to the entire state which could place \"California on intellectual parity with Mississippi and Tennessee.\" Mencken later wrote: \"The trial, indeed, was an orgy typical of the half-fabulous California courts. The very officers of justice denounced her riotously in the Hearst papers while it was in progress.\"<ref name=\"ralphmag1\"/>\n\n===Theories and rebuttals===\n\nThe Los Angeles prosecution office purported McPherson left the beach with Kenneth Ormiston and stayed with him at Carmel-by-the-Sea for 10 days. Because they were almost identified by a reporter who stopped their car, the two fled California at the end of May, holed up somewhere for most of June; then made their way through Arizona to Mexico where she was dropped off outside of Agua Prieta.\n\nTelegraph operator William Blevins supplanted this theory when he declared he identified McPherson from photographs. He compared handwriting from his logs to samples printed in the newspapers from the grocery slips found at the Carmel-by-the-Sea cottage yard. He said she came into his office at Gila Bend, Arizona, on June 15 and sent a message to Tucson, Arizona; saying an automobile had broken down and she was taking a train. The prosecution confirmed his findings, and subpoenaed two more local witnesses who claimed they saw the same woman; and announced it in the news.\n[[File:LAPLgroceryslips00028129.jpg|thumb|Two fragments of the much publicized controversial grocery slips which were found at the Carmel cottage of Kenneth G. Ormiston and the mysterious \"Miss X.\"  Printed in the newspapers, the prosecution thought they had matched the slips to Aimee Semple McPherson's handwriting traced to a telegraph log in Gila Bend, Arizona, at a time she claimed to have been held by kidnappers. Another woman, Gail X. Koontz, was discovered to have signed the log.]]\n\nThe defense had a surprise witness, one the angry prosecution tried to prevent from appearing as she was presented out of turn at the inquiry. Stymied by objections from the prosecuting attorney, she was effectively silenced until Judge Samuel R. Blake intervened and allowed her to speak. The wife of an airman stationed in the Philippines, Mrs. Gail X. Koontz, said it was she, and not the evangelist, who sent a telegram from Gila Bend to Tucson on June 15. After withdrawing their much publicized witnesses, the prosecution continued to offer theories. However, they had nothing to present in court to establish McPherson's whereabouts anytime during the three weeks prior to her reappearance at Douglas, Arizona.<ref>''Healdsburg Tribune'', Number 278, \"Prosecution seeks to prevent defense Witnesses Testimony\", October 16, 1926; p. 1.</ref><ref>''St. Petersburg Times''; October 7, 1926; p. 1.</ref><ref>''Santa Cruz Evening News''; October 16, 1926; p. 1.</ref>\n\nA commentary published in an Ohio newspaper explored the situation. It did not help the prosecution's case in their claim that Ormiston and McPherson had been madly in love since Ormiston was absent from Los Angeles five months prior to the evangelist's disappearance. Also, Ormiston was being divorced by his wife, the pair could have gotten married. That she would choose to jeopardize her 2 million-dollar establishment that took great effort to create and undermine her career as a credible religious leader of 30,000 faithful followers to travel about the coast disguised in googles and a cap made no sense. If such an excursion were desired, there were easier and alternative methods she could have used.<ref>''The Journal News'' (Hamilton, Ohio); November 13, 1926; p. 59.</ref>\n\nOther theories and [[innuendo]] were rampant on what actually occurred, and also without evidence to establish credibility: that she had run off with some other lover, had gone off to have an [[abortion]], was taking time to heal from [[plastic surgery]], or had staged a [[publicity stunt]].

McKinley who was trusted by the kidnappers because he was blind. In May and again in June, two men, Miller and Wilson, aliases for \"Steve\" and the unnamed assailant of the McPherson complaint, allegedly approached him then made an offer to return Aimee Semple McPherson for $25,000. They told him a rubber mask was briefly used on McPherson when taking her and the drug was laced with one quarter grain (16&nbsp;mg) of morphine insuring she was \"doped\" safely and quickly. They were given four questions passed to McKinley from Kennedy that only her daughter knew to prove the men actually had her. Mildred Kennedy also gave McKinley $1,000 to assist him in his work. A ransom note was relayed and given to the police who in disguise, visited a hotel lobby drop site as a precaution in case it was genuine. No results were forthcoming and the note dismissed as fraudulent. Another ransom note demanding $500,000 was sent to the Angelus Temple with two of the questions correctly answered. McPherson later recalled an incident from her captivity when two of the kidnappers returned annoyed from an errand at a hotel stating they recognized the detectives positioned there and left. She also said they asked her personal questions and once she realized what they were doing and refused to answer further. She thought as the $500,000 being asked for her return was way too much, the Temple did not have it. One of them then burned her with his cigar in an attempt to get the other two questions answered. They threatened to take a finger if their ransom note did not work. Some days later, McPherson escaped.\n\n''\n[[File:LAPLMorris McKinley00021705.jpg|thumb|left| Attorney R. A. McKinley and his secretary, Bernice Morris. The blind Long Beach attorney was killed in an automobile accident and had claimed to have been approached by the alleged McPherson kidnappers in a deal for ransom.|599x599px]]\n''\nAfter McPherson's return to Los Angeles, McKinley promised to obtain information which would prove to the court kidnappers had indeed held her during the disappearance. Since McKinley had a good reputation,<ref>Hardy Impeachment, p. 1078.</ref> Kennedy, McPherson, and Judge Carlos Hardy, continued to work with him. A car accident in August, though, claimed his life. McKinley's sudden death, Mildred Kennedy thought, was peculiar, occurring as it did just before he was ready to reveal some important piece of evidence. His death was considered a serious blow to McPherson's case. His secretary, Miss Bernice Morris, however, testified for the prosecution stating she did not believe there were any alleged kidnappers. She had respect for her late boss, Mr. McKinley, though on the stand was forced to consider either he was in on the plot to manufacture evidence or an unwitting dupe. The prosecution purported the McPherson party sent at least two persons posing as the kidnappers to fool McKinley and secure his testimony lending credibility to the kidnapping story. This theory, as one biographer, Nancy Barr Mavity pointed out, had serious issues since it introduced two extra persons into the scam increasing the likelihood of exposure.<ref>Mavity, p. 107-109.</ref>\n\nBernice Morris also stated she had a photo made up of persons posing as the kidnappers and disguised them based on McPherson description. McPherson was shown the image represented to her as an actual photo of her assailants. Allegedly, McPherson's reaction to it was as a genuine identification. Since only actors were in the image, Morris took it as admission McPherson was penetrating a fraud by identifying them as her captors. McPherson denied Morris' contention, the subjects in the photo were in heavy shadow and the expletive Morris claimed she used when seeing the photo, was one not known to have been said by the evangelist in times of surprise.<ref>The Waco News-Tribune; June 24, 1926; p. 2.</ref><ref>Hardy transcripts p. 732.</ref><ref>Lately, Thomas The Vanishing Evangelist: the Aimee Semple McPherson Kidnapping Affair (Viking Press, 1959) p. 26.</ref><ref name=\"Cox, pp. 17\u201318\"/><ref name=\"Epstein, pp. 295, 312\"/> Bernice Morris continued with other damaging testimony, however, the defense was only allowed by the judge to minimally cross examine her. To check her credibility, McPherson lawyers asked for the release of McKinley's transcribed statement, which was earlier given to the DA's office before his death. The lawyers wanted to determine if any of it confirmed his secretary's story, or even if his testimony matched what McKinley was telling the Temple about his work. Of particular interest to the defense was what the transcripts in question said about a trip McKinley and his secretary, Bernice Morris; made to San Francisco in mid-August to meet with one of the alleged kidnappers. The prosecution refused, stating those documents were irrelevant and the judge, Samuel R. Blake; said it was outside his power to compel their release.<ref>Cox, p. 206.</ref>\n\nAnother person, employee of the Southern Pacific Engineering Department on September 26, made a statement Miss Morris was actually Mrs. Bernice Morris Allcorn Simpson, implying she was involved in a homosexual relationship. Living with Morris and passed off as her sister, was an 18 year old teenager. A McPherson lawyer told of an anonymous call coming into his office about Morris being pressured by a Los Angeles detective. Unless she gave testimony disparaging of the evangelist, Morris' lesbian relationship would be publicly exposed. McPherson and her mother jointly declared their faith in McKinley's work and that Miss Morris was being coerced to say things she knew that were not true.<ref>Cox, 148-149.</ref>\n[[File:LAPL Murchison 00021985.jpg|thumb|right|Sergeant Alonzo Murchison of Douglas, Arizona, illustrating on a blackboard the events concerning Aimee Semple McPherson in the courtroom of Judge Samuel R. Blake on October 7, 1926|496x496px]]\n\nAccording to Judge Carlos Hardy, the police were doing little in looking for kidnappers; instead treating her story as false. Mildred Kennedy, therefore, hired the [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns Detective Agency]] to look for evidence supporting their side of the story. \nSince the manager of the agency, J.W. Buchanan, did not want to report to a woman, Judge Hardy handled the details of the investigation. Rumors about several sets of \"Steves\" and \"Roses\" associated in criminal activities quickly turned up. One initially promising lead came from a convict who overheard fellow prisoners talk about the kidnapping as an actual event and involving a specific Steve, Rose and Frank who indicated a lot of money could be made kidnapping and ransoming McPherson. However, that particular Rose was discovered to have been dead and Steve in prison prior to McPherson's disappearance. \"Frank\" was still at large.<ref>Hardy Impeachment, pp. 109, 2217.</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 1926, an ''El Paso Herald'' reporter asked [[Emil Lewis Holmdahl]], an American infantryman turned soldier of fortune, if he had been involved in the alleged kidnapping of famous California evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Holmdahl, who fought extensively in earlier Latin American turmoil wars and was cleared by a Mexican judge as a suspect in the February 6, 1926 theft of [[Pancho Villa]]'s head, enigmatically replied regarding McPherson, \"Well, maybe I did and maybe I didn't.\" In contrast, unless intoxicated, he always emphatically denied participating in a grave robbery that stole Villa's head.<ref>Meed, Douglas V. \"Soldier of Fortune--Adventuring in Latin America and Mexico with Emil Lewis Holmdahl,\" Halcyon Press Limited, 2003, p. 191.</ref>\n\nOn October 8, police sergeant of Douglas Arizona, Alonzo B. Murchison, was questioned by the defense counsel about a report he submitted tending to substantiate the existence of \"Steve\" and \"Rose,\" two of the alleged kidnappers McPherson described. The couple had registered frequently under the name of Mr. and Mrs. J. Stone at the Gladstone Hotel, in Douglas. \"Steve\" placed a car in a Douglas garage in June 16. The woman was identified as Rose McBridge, a nurse. A Los Angeles special investigator later believed Steve to be H. M. Hughes; and found a couple of their description staying at a ranch in Wellton, Arizona.<ref>''Berkeley Daily Gazette'' \"Rose\" and \"Steve,\" Evidence found (United Press) October 8, 1926; pp, 1, 13.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe 1926 grand jury case, the largest of its kind in California, had hundreds of reporters and agencies looking for discrediting evidence against McPherson.

Note: In 1929 the California state senate conducted an impeachment trial of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carlos S. Hardy for providing legal aid to McPherson, violating the rules of office. McPherson was called to testify, but little interest was shown in prosecuting Hardy. The same witnesses and other persons from the earlier 1926 grand jury trial appeared, and McPherson was again in the headlines, being investigated. The impeachment trial cost another $50,000 (about US $660,000 in 2012), presumably borne largely by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', with the exception of the $25,000 (about US $330,000 in 2012) taxpayer money it cost to print the 1,300 page trial transcript. McPherson had to endure the same humiliation she had endured in the 1926 trial, when the discussion was primarily about her hair, legs, and morals. Charges against Hardy were dropped and the state assembly instead called for Los Angeles prosecutors to reopen the case to criminally charge McPherson. The Los Angeles offices declined.</ref> Journalist Morrow Mayo noted it was the last chance in California to \"ruin that red-headed sorceress\", and \"she is free to serve the Lord until the Marines are called out.\" <ref>Sutton, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe tale was later satirized in a song performed by [[Pete Seeger]] called \"The Ballad of Aimee McPherson,\" with lyrics claiming the kidnapping had been unlikely because a hotel love nest revealed \"the dents in the mattress fitted Aimee's [[Buttocks|caboose]].\"\n\nThe [[Court of Historical Review and Appeal]] in San Francisco, which holds no legal authority, is made up of members of the bench who examine and retry historical cases and controversies. In April 1990, a decision was handed down regarding the matter of McPherson's kidnapping story. George T. Choppelas, the then presiding judge of the San Francisco Municipal Court, ruling for the Court of Historical Review, found the issues involved both serious and fascinating. He concluded that \"there was never any substantial evidence to show that her story was untrue.

Prior to that, all Ukrainian Catholics had been under the jurisdiction of the local Roman ordinary. In 1924, the status of the ordinariate was elevated to that of [[exarchate]], known as the ''Apostolic Exarchate of United States of America, Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Ukrainian)''.  The Exarchate was then elevated to the status of Archeparchy by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950.
