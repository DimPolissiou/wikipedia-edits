By the DBR4's world championship debut at the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]], it had become outdated and struggled for pace against its competitors, with [[Carroll Shelby]] and [[Roy Salvadori]] qualifying 10th and 13th respectively out of 15.<ref name=\"DBR4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/17/Aston-Martin-DBR4.html|title=Aston Martin DBR4|website=ultimatecarpage.com|date=18 March 2016|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://database.motorsportmagazine.com/database/races/1959-dutch-grand-prix|title=1959 Dutch Grand Prix|website=motorsportmagazine.com|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Salvadori retired from the race in the early laps with an engine failure, with Shelby's car suffering the same fate later in the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1959/55/dutch-grand-prix-a-brm-victory-at-last|title=1959 Dutch Grand Prix race report: Bonnier makes his mark|author=Denis Jenkinson|website=motorsportmagazine.com|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe team's next entry came at the [[1959 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] where Salvadori surprised by qualifying in 2nd place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr080.html|title=British GP, 1959|website=grandprix.com|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Early in the race, one of Shelby's [[ignition magneto|ignition magnetos]] failed, harming his car's pace.
