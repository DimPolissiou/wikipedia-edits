The university offers undergraduate and [[graduate degrees]], including [[Doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree]]s and [[Online degree|online masters]] as well.\n\nThe university was founded in 1829 and is the tenth largest private university in the country in terms of full-time students. It is internationally known for its science, computer, engineering, and art programs, as well as for the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]], a leading deaf-education institution that provides educational opportunities to more than 1000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students. RIT is known for its Co-op program that gives students professional and industrial experience. It has the fourth oldest and one of the largest Co-op programs in the world.\n\nRIT student population is approximately 19,000 students, about 16,000 undergraduate and 3000 graduate. Demographically, students attend from all 50 states in the United States and from more than 100 countries around the world. The university has more than 4000 active faculty and staff members who engage with the students in a wide range of academic activities and research projects. It also has branches abroad, its global campuses, located in China, Croatia, United Arab Emirates ([[Dubai]]), and Kosovo.\n\nThirteen RIT alumni and faculty members have been recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rit.edu/about-rit#key-facts| title = Key facts about RIT|website=rit.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe university began as a result of an 1891 merger between '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um''', a [[literary society]] founded in 1829 by [[Nathaniel Rochester|Colonel Nathaniel Rochester]] and associates, and '''The Mechanics Institute''', a Rochester school of practical [[Vocational education|technical training]] for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including [[Henry Lomb|Captain Henry Lomb]], co-founder of [[Bausch & Lomb]]. The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}). Its art department was originally located in the [[Bevier Memorial Building]]. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the [[New York (state)|New York]] Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, an unanticipated donation of $3.27&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3270000|1961|r=0}}}} today) from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new {{convert|1300|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus several miles south along the east bank of the [[Genesee River]] in suburban [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]]. Upon completion in 1968, the university moved to the new suburban campus, where it resides today.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=Dane R.|title=Rochester Institute of Technology: Industrial Development and Educational Innovation in an American City, 1829\u20132006|year=2007|publisher=RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press|isbn=978-1-933360-23-2}}</ref><ref name=\"rit_timeline\">{{cite web | url=http://www2.rit.edu/175/timeline.html | title=RIT Timeline | author=Rochester Institute of Technology | accessdate=December 26, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226103733/http://www2.rit.edu/175/timeline.html | archive-date=February 26, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, RIT was selected by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] to be the site of the newly founded [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]] (NTID).<ref>{{Cite news | title=ROCHESTER TO GET U.S. DEAF COLLEGE | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 15, 1966 | page=22  }}</ref> NTID admitted its first students in 1968, concurrent with RIT's transition to the Henrietta campus.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Marschark | first = Marc | last2 = Lang | first2 = Harry G. | year = 2002 | title = Educating Deaf Students: From Research to Practice | location = [[New York City]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | page = 35 | isbn = 978-0-19-512139-1 | oclc = 45668968 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, RIT took over [[Eisenhower College]], a liberal arts college located in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].

This property is largely covered with woodland and fresh-water [[swamp]] making it a very diverse [[wetland]] which is home to a number of somewhat rare plant species. The campus comprises 237 buildings and 5.1&nbsp;million square feet (474,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of building space.

More recent additions to the campus have diversified the architecture while still incorporating the traditional brick colors.

On the academic side of the walkway is a courtyard, known as the Infinity Quad due to a striking polished stainless steel sculpture (by Jose' de Rivera, 1968, 19'\u00d78'\u00d72{{frac|1|2}}') of a continuous ribbon-like [[M\u00f6bius strip]] (commonly referred to as the infinity loop because if the sun hits the strip at a certain angle it will cast a shadow in the shape of an infinity symbol on the ground) in the middle of it; on the residence hall side is a [[sundial]] and a clock. These symbols represent time to infinity.{{dubious|date=August 2015}} The Quarter Mile is actually {{convert|0.41|mi|km}} long when measured between the mobius sculpture and the sundial.

The university offers undergraduate and [[graduate degrees]], including [[Doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree]]s and [[Online degree|online masters]] as well.\n\nThe university was founded in 1829 and is the tenth largest private university in the country in terms of full-time students. It is internationally known for its science, computer, engineering, and art programs, as well as for the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]], a leading deaf-education institution that provides educational opportunities to more than 1000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students. RIT is known for its Co-op program that gives students professional and industrial experience. It has the fourth oldest and one of the largest Co-op programs in the world.\n\nRIT student population is approximately 19,000 students, about 16,000 undergraduate and 3000 graduate. Demographically, students attend from all 50 states in the United States and from more than 100 countries around the world. The university has more than 4000 active faculty and staff members who engage with the students in a wide range of academic activities and research projects. It also has branches abroad, its global campuses, located in China, Croatia, United Arab Emirates ([[Dubai]]), and Kosovo.\n\nThirteen RIT alumni and faculty members have been recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rit.edu/about-rit#key-facts| title = Key facts about RIT|website=rit.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe university began as a result of an 1891 merger between '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um''', a [[literary society]] founded in 1829 by [[Nathaniel Rochester|Colonel Nathaniel Rochester]] and associates, and '''The Mechanics Institute''', a Rochester school of practical [[Vocational education|technical training]] for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including [[Henry Lomb|Captain Henry Lomb]], co-founder of [[Bausch & Lomb]]. The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}). Its art department was originally located in the [[Bevier Memorial Building]]. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the [[New York (state)|New York]] Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, an unanticipated donation of $3.27&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3270000|1961|r=0}}}} today) from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new {{convert|1300|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus several miles south along the east bank of the [[Genesee River]] in suburban [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]].
