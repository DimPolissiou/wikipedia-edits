She was [[Queen regent|regent]] of Spain during her husband's long travels in Europe during 1529-1533, 1535-1536 and 1538-1539. \n\nBorn to [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and [[Maria of Aragon]], Isabella was the granddaughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Throughout her life, many compared her to her grandmother for her intelligence, character and determination in politics. Her personal motto was \"aut Caesar aut nihil\" ('either Cesar or nothing'). It was thanks to her governorships that Spain was able to remain independent of imperial policies.<ref>S. Jansen: The Monstrous Regiment of Women: Female Rulers in Early Modern Europe, 2002</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nIsabella was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on October 24, 1503 and named after her maternal grandmother and [[Isabella of Asturias|aunt]], who had been her father's first wife. She was the second child and eldest daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]]. Isabella was second-in-line to the throne until the birth of her brother [[Luis, Duke of Beja|Luis]] in 1506.\n\nIsabella was educated under the supervision of her mother and her governess, [[Elvira de Mendoza]]. She would progressively become an intelligent young woman, learning [[politics]], [[mathematics]], the languages of [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], [[Renaissance]] classics, and the Christian doctrine. In addition to all this, she was possessed a vast library composed of works for prayer and more mundane works which were of her taste, especially on [[cavalry]].\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the oldest daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, Isabella was a rather attractive candidate for marriage. Her mother left in her will, and in a clear message to her husband, the desire that the 14 years-old Isabella should marry only a king or the legitimate son of kings. The ideal candidate for Isabella's husband was her first cousin [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], son of Maria's sister, [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Philip I of Castile]]. A marriage would bring a strong alliance between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, in accordance with the wishes of their grandparents, Isabella and Ferdinand: It would facilitate to continue the exploration of the oceans without incurring clashes, as Portugal was the only naval power that could question Spain's supremacy in the Atlantic. As Charles was sovereign of multiple kingdoms, Spain needed allies and it was necessary that Portugal (Christendom's richest kingdom) fall under its orbit and not of France, which had happened in the [[War of Castilian Succession]]. Moreover, the nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood from the Iberian peninsula, just like Isabella.\n\nHowever, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice, instead sending his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father in 1518. Charles's Flemish advisors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], later convinced him to relegate the Portuguese alliance to the background and replace it with an alliance with England. In 1521, Charles became engaged to his other first cousin [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]], who was sixteen years younger than Charles and still a child. Their engagement sought to undo an alliance between England and France, articulated by the ambitious Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Many in Portugal took Isabella's rejection as an offence, but Isabella remained determined and hopeful that she would marry her powerful cousin: The choice was that she would marry only Charles or she would enter a convent.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could wait no longer for Mary Tudor to get older, as he was determined to have legitimate children. His engagement was called off, the alliance with England was abandoned, and Charles finally sought to marry Isabella. There were many more advantages - she was closer to him in age (she was only three years his junior), fluent in Spanish, and offered a handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds, which was more than enough to solve many of his economic and financial problems brought on by the [[Italian War of 1521-26]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=James D.|title=Emperor Charles V, Impresario of War : campaign strategy, international finance, and domestic politics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=9780521814317|page=114|edition=}}</ref> The negotiations and marriage contract for an alliance with Portugal were made - Isabella would marry Charles and her brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]].\n\n==Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Spain==\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Marriage and Honeymoon===\nIn January 1526, Isabella travelled to Spain. Upon her arrival, she met a by the [[Duke of Calabria]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] and the [[Duke of B\u00e9jar]] at the Spanish-Portuguese border. They escorted her to [[Seville]], where she was to wait for Charkes for a week. Their wedding took place that very same day just after midnight on 11 March in the Palace of [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacQuarrie|first=Kim|title=The Last Days of the Incas|url=https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1416539352|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq/page/35 35]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=A Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain, and Readers at Home: Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108037534|page=258}}</ref> \n\nAlthough their marriage was originally a political arrangement, Isabella captivated her husband with her charm and beauty. Following their wedding, the couple spent a long honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] and records show that during their honeymoon \"when [Charles and Isabella] are together, although there are many people around, they do not notice anyone else; they talk and laugh, and nothing else distracts them.\"{{quote needs citation|date=August 2018}} Charkes ordered the seeds of a Persian flower, that had never been seen before in Spain, to be planted in the gardens of the Alhambra. The seeds eventually grew into the red carnation and Isabella was so delighted by the new flower that her husband ordered thousands more to be planted in her honour. The red carnation later became Spain's [[floral emblem]].\n\n===Regency===\n[[File:Isabel de Portugal, Pompeo Leoni.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze statue of Empress Isabella by [[Leone Leoni]], 1550-1555, that was commissioned by Charles V, on display at the [[El Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIsabella proved to be a very competent politician when she served as [[List of Spanish regents|regent of Spain]] during her husband's absences due to political affairs and [[wars]] abroad between 1529\u20131532 and 1535\u20131539. She attended meetings of the governing councils, consulted with the ministers, and eventually\ntook a more active role in the policy-making process. The Emperor was impressed with many of her accomplishments and decisions.\n\nAll the documentation of the time indicates{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} that Isabella was a profound connoisseur of the problems of the peninsular kingdoms, defending intransigently the good common to particular interests. At the external level, her sensible actions were decisive in the defence of the coasts of the peninsula and of [[North Africa]], those [[investment|invested]] by [[piracy]].\n\nDuring her time as regent, Isabella traveled a lot around Spain, defending the royal power and the monarch's supreme authority. She traveled regularly in the autumn between [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Valladolid]], Seville, [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]]. To deal with important matters of the empire, Charles and Isabella wrote to each other regularly. Sometimes, the Emperor didn't write for months, to the point that the Empress \"scolded\" him in one letter, saying that at least, she would write \"every twenty days.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Life at Court===\nWhen she heard that her husband was about to return, Isabella sent receptions with large parties. However, the time she was alone with her children, [[ladies-in-waiting]], and counselors of the court, she had a simpler life.\n\nIsabella ensured that their children's educations, especially that of her son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], were very completed. She even personally taught them her native language, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n==Health and Death==\n{{cns|date=August 2018|text=Isabella suffered from [[tertian fever]]s, which became chronic later in her life. She also suffered several times from malaria, causing her health to be very fragile. Due to the very hot weather of Toledo and Seville, she spent the summers in the milder [[Avila, Spain|Avila]] because she suffered several times from illness. She had a total of seven pregnancies, out of which five were successful, and suffered two miscarriages. Her husband's absences caused her great loneliness, which some historians believe further weakened her delicate health.|reason=}} There is also speculation that Isabella may have suffered from consumption and its effects debilited her further. A contemporary described her not long before her death: \"The Empress is the greatest pity in the world; she is so thin as to not resemble a person.\"\n\nIn 1539, Isabella became pregnant for the seventh time, but in the third month of the pregnancy she contracted another fever that caused antenatal complications and gave birth to a stillborn son. She died two weeks later on 1 May 1539 at the age of 35.<ref>Geoffrey Parker (2014), ''Imprudent King: A New Life of Philip II'', New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 12. {{ISBN|9780300196535}}</ref> The Emperor was left so devastated by his wife's death that he couldn't bring himself to accompany her body to the [[Royal Chapel of Granada]], the burial place of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. Instead, he instructed their son Philip to accompany his mother's body with [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda]]. When Borgia conveyed Isabella's remains and saw the effects of [[decomposition]] on the beautiful empress, he decided to \"never again serve a mortal master\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After his own wife's death in 1541, Borgia retired from court and became a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn the aftermath, Charles locked himself up in a monastery for two months, where he prayed and mourned for his wife alone, but never recovered from Isabella's death; he never remarried and dressed in black for the rest of his life. He died on 21 September 1558, holding in his hand the cross that his wife had been holding when she died.\n\n===Post-mortem Tributes and Reburials===\n[[File:La Gloria (Tiziano).jpg|thumb|right|Titian's ''La Gloria'', one of the several paintings commissioned by Charles V in memory of his wife Isabella]]\nIn memory of Isabella, Charles commissioned several tributes through art and music, beginning in 1540 when he commissioned the Flemish composer [[Thomas Crecquillon]] to compose new music in honour of the Empress. Crecquillon composed his ''Missa Mort m'a priv\u00e9'' as a memorial to Isabella, which expresses the Emperor's grief and great wish for a heavenly reunion with his beloved wife.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography/thomas-crecquillon-missa-mort-ma-prive-motets-and-chansons/|title= Thomas Crecquillon: Missa 'Mort m\u2019a priv\u00e9', motets and chansons|last=Ham |first=Martin |date=2006 |website= The Brabant Ensemble| access-date=23 October 2018}}\n</ref> Another musical tribute to Isabella is ''Carole cur defles Isabellam'' that was composed in 1545 by the Franco-Flemish composer [[Nicolas Payen]].\n\nIn 1543, Charles commissioned his favourite painter [[Titian]] to paint posthumous portraits of Isabella by using earlier ones of her as his model. Titian painted several portraits of the Empress, which included his ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal|Portrait of The Empress Isabel of Portugal]]'' and ''[[La Gloria (Titian)|La Gloria]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-glory/66149817-6f88-4e5f-a09a-81f63a84d145|title= The Glory.  1551 \u2013 1554.

Charles kept these portraits with him whenever he travelled and after he retired to the [[Monastery of Yuste]] in 1555.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-empress-isabel-of-portugal/d4eddf35-c76c-4c11-8f2b-099f7b71d696|title= The Empress Isabel of Portugal|website= Museo del Prado (Prado Museum)| access-date=23 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cenotafio de Carlos I de Espa\u00f1a y su familia.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella at the Basilica in El Escorial]]\nIn 1574, the body of Empress Isabella was transferred by her son Philip II to the [[El Escorial|Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], where she was originally interred into a small vault along with her husband directly underneath the altar of the Royal Chapel. This was done in accordance with Charles's last will and testament, in which he left a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he and Isabella would be reburied together side by side, \"half-body under the altar and half under the priest's feet\". They remained in the Royal Chapel while the famous Basilica of the Monastery and the Royal Crypt were still under construction.\n\nIn 1654, after the Basilica and Royal Crypt were finally completed during the reign of their great-grandson [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the remains of Charles and Isabella were moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings, which lies directly under the Basilica.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delacuadra.net/escorial/textos/1997c-a-panteo.pdf |title=A-Panteo.Pdf |date= |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]] and Charles's sisters, [[Eleanor of Austria]] and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Maria of Hungary]], behind them. Exactly adjacent to them on the opposite side of the Basilica are effigies of their son Philip with three of his wives and their ill-fated grandson, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]].\n\n==Issue==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Name !! style=\"width:100px;\"| Portrait !!

She was [[Queen regent|regent]] of Spain during her husband's long travels in Europe during 1529-1533, 1535-1536 and 1538-1539. \n\nBorn to [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and [[Maria of Aragon]], Isabella was the granddaughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Throughout her life, many compared her to her grandmother for her intelligence, character and determination in politics. Her personal motto was \"aut Caesar aut nihil\" ('either Cesar or nothing'). It was thanks to her governorships that Spain was able to remain independent of imperial policies.<ref>S. Jansen: The Monstrous Regiment of Women: Female Rulers in Early Modern Europe, 2002</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nIsabella was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on October 24, 1503 and named after her maternal grandmother and [[Isabella of Asturias|aunt]], who had been her father's first wife. She was the second child and eldest daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]]. Isabella was second-in-line to the throne until the birth of her brother [[Luis, Duke of Beja|Luis]] in 1506.\n\nIsabella was educated under the supervision of her mother and her governess, [[Elvira de Mendoza]]. She would progressively become an intelligent young woman, learning [[politics]], [[mathematics]], the languages of [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], [[Renaissance]] classics, and the Christian doctrine. In addition to all this, she was possessed a vast library composed of works for prayer and more mundane works which were of her taste, especially on [[cavalry]].\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the oldest daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, Isabella was a rather attractive candidate for marriage. Her mother left in her will, and in a clear message to her husband, the desire that the 14 years-old Isabella should marry only a king or the legitimate son of kings. The ideal candidate for Isabella's husband was her first cousin [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], son of Maria's sister, [[Joanna of Castile]], and [[Philip I of Castile]]. A marriage would bring a strong alliance between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, in accordance with the wishes of their grandparents, Isabella and Ferdinand: It would facilitate to continue the exploration of the oceans without incurring clashes, as Portugal was the only naval power that could question Spain's supremacy in the Atlantic. As Charles was sovereign of multiple kingdoms, Spain needed allies and it was necessary that Portugal (Christendom's richest kingdom) fall under its orbit and not of France, which had happened in the [[War of Castilian Succession]]. Moreover, the nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood from the Iberian peninsula, just like Isabella.\n\nHowever, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice, instead sending his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father in 1518. Charles's Flemish advisors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], later convinced him to relegate the Portuguese alliance to the background and replace it with an alliance with England. In 1521, Charles became engaged to his other first cousin [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]], who was sixteen years younger than Charles and still a child. Their engagement sought to undo an alliance between England and France, articulated by the ambitious Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. Many in Portugal took Isabella's rejection as an offence, but Isabella remained determined and hopeful that she would marry her powerful cousin: The choice was that she would marry only Charles or she would enter a convent.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could wait no longer for Mary Tudor to get older, as he was determined to have legitimate children. His engagement was called off, the alliance with England was abandoned, and Charles finally sought to marry Isabella. There were many more advantages - she was closer to him in age (she was only three years his junior), fluent in Spanish, and offered a handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds, which was more than enough to solve many of his economic and financial problems brought on by the [[Italian War of 1521-26]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=James D.|title=Emperor Charles V, Impresario of War : campaign strategy, international finance, and domestic politics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=9780521814317|page=114|edition=}}</ref> The negotiations and marriage contract for an alliance with Portugal were made - Isabella would marry Charles and her brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]].\n\n==Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Spain==\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Marriage and Honeymoon===\nIn January 1526, Isabella travelled to Spain. Upon her arrival, she met a by the [[Duke of Calabria]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] and the [[Duke of B\u00e9jar]] at the Spanish-Portuguese border. They escorted her to [[Seville]], where she was to wait for Charkes for a week. Their wedding took place that very same day just after midnight on 11 March in the Palace of [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacQuarrie|first=Kim|title=The Last Days of the Incas|url=https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1416539352|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastdaysofincas00macq/page/35 35]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=A Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain, and Readers at Home: Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108037534|page=258}}</ref> \n\nAlthough their marriage was originally a political arrangement, Isabella captivated her husband with her charm and beauty. Following their wedding, the couple spent a long honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] and records show that during their honeymoon \"when [Charles and Isabella] are together, although there are many people around, they do not notice anyone else; they talk and laugh, and nothing else distracts them.\"{{quote needs citation|date=August 2018}} Charkes ordered the seeds of a Persian flower, that had never been seen before in Spain, to be planted in the gardens of the Alhambra. The seeds eventually grew into the red carnation and Isabella was so delighted by the new flower that her husband ordered thousands more to be planted in her honour. The red carnation later became Spain's [[floral emblem]].\n\n===Regency===\n[[File:Isabel de Portugal, Pompeo Leoni.jpg|thumb|left|The bronze statue of Empress Isabella by [[Leone Leoni]], 1550-1555, that was commissioned by Charles V, on display at the [[El Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]].]]\n\nIsabella proved to be a very competent politician when she served as [[List of Spanish regents|regent of Spain]] during her husband's absences due to political affairs and [[wars]] abroad between 1529\u20131532 and 1535\u20131539. She attended meetings of the governing councils, consulted with the ministers, and eventually\ntook a more active role in the policy-making process. The Emperor was impressed with many of her accomplishments and decisions.\n\nAll the documentation of the time indicates{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} that Isabella was a profound connoisseur of the problems of the peninsular kingdoms, defending intransigently the good common to particular interests. At the external level, her sensible actions were decisive in the defence of the coasts of the peninsula and of [[North Africa]], those [[investment|invested]] by [[piracy]].\n\nDuring her time as regent, Isabella traveled a lot around Spain, defending the royal power and the monarch's supreme authority. She traveled regularly in the autumn between [[Toledo]], [[Valladolid]], Seville, [[Barcelona]] and [[Majorca]]. To deal with important matters of the empire, Charles and Isabella wrote to each other regularly. Sometimes, the Emperor didn't write for months, to the point that the Empress \"scolded\" him in one letter, saying that at least, she would write \"every twenty days.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Life at Court===\nWhen she heard that her husband was about to return, Isabella sent receptions with large parties. However, the time she was alone with her children, [[ladies-in-waiting]], and counselors of the court, she had a simpler life.\n\nIsabella ensured that their children's educations, especially that of her son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], were very completed. She even personally taught them her native language, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\n==Health and Death==\n{{cns|date=August 2018|text=Isabella suffered from [[tertian fever]]s, which became chronic later in her life. She also suffered several times from malaria, causing her health to be very fragile. Due to the very hot weather of Toledo and Seville, she spent the summers in the milder [[Avila, Spain|Avila]] because she suffered several times from illness. She had a total of seven pregnancies, out of which five were successful, and suffered two miscarriages. Her husband's absences caused her great loneliness, which some historians believe further weakened her delicate health.|reason=}} There is also speculation that Isabella may have suffered from consumption and its effects debilited her further. A contemporary described her not long before her death: \"The Empress is the greatest pity in the world; she is so thin as to not resemble a person.\"\n\nIn 1539, Isabella became pregnant for the seventh time, but in the third month of the pregnancy she contracted another fever that caused antenatal complications and gave birth to a stillborn son. She died two weeks later on 1 May 1539 at the age of 35.<ref>Geoffrey Parker (2014), ''Imprudent King: A New Life of Philip II'', New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 12. {{ISBN|9780300196535}}</ref> The Emperor was left so devastated by his wife's death that he couldn't bring himself to accompany her body to the [[Royal Chapel of Granada]], the burial place of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. Instead, he instructed their son Philip to accompany his mother's body with [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda]]. When Borgia conveyed Isabella's remains and saw the effects of [[decomposition]] on the beautiful empress, he decided to \"never again serve a mortal master\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After his own wife's death in 1541, Borgia retired from court and became a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn the aftermath, Charles locked himself up in a monastery for two months, where he prayed and mourned for his wife alone, but never recovered from Isabella's death; he never remarried and dressed in black for the rest of his life. He died on 21 September 1558, holding in his hand the cross that his wife had been holding when she died.\n\n===Post-mortem Tributes and Reburials===\n[[File:La Gloria (Tiziano).jpg|thumb|right|Titian's ''La Gloria'', one of the several paintings commissioned by Charles V in memory of his wife Isabella]]\nIn memory of Isabella, Charles commissioned several tributes through art and music, beginning in 1540 when he commissioned the Flemish composer [[Thomas Crecquillon]] to compose new music in honour of the Empress. Crecquillon composed his ''Missa Mort m'a priv\u00e9'' as a memorial to Isabella, which expresses the Emperor's grief and great wish for a heavenly reunion with his beloved wife.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brabantensemble.com/discography/thomas-crecquillon-missa-mort-ma-prive-motets-and-chansons/|title= Thomas Crecquillon: Missa 'Mort m\u2019a priv\u00e9', motets and chansons|last=Ham |first=Martin |date=2006 |website= The Brabant Ensemble| access-date=23 October 2018}}\n</ref> Another musical tribute to Isabella is ''Carole cur defles Isabellam'' that was composed in 1545 by the Franco-Flemish composer [[Nicolas Payen]].\n\nIn 1543, Charles commissioned his favourite painter [[Titian]] to paint posthumous portraits of Isabella by using earlier ones of her as his model. Titian painted several portraits of the Empress, which included his ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal|Portrait of The Empress Isabel of Portugal]]'' and ''[[La Gloria (Titian)|La Gloria]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-glory/66149817-6f88-4e5f-a09a-81f63a84d145|title= The Glory.  1551 \u2013 1554.

This was done in accordance with Charles's last will and testament, in which he left a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he and Isabella would be reburied together side by side, \"half-body under the altar and half under the priest's feet\". They remained in the Royal Chapel while the famous Basilica of the Monastery and the Royal Crypt were still under construction.\n\nIn 1654, after the Basilica and Royal Crypt were finally completed during the reign of their great-grandson [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the remains of Charles and Isabella were moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings, which lies directly under the Basilica.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delacuadra.net/escorial/textos/1997c-a-panteo.pdf |title=A-Panteo.Pdf |date= |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]] and Charles's sisters, [[Eleanor of Austria]] and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Maria of Hungary]], behind them.

The series stars [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ned (Pushing Daisies)|Ned]], a pie-maker with the ability to bring dead things back to life with his touch, an ability that comes with stipulations. Together with his formerly deceased childhood crush [[Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles|Chuck]] ([[Anna Friel]]), private investigator [[Emerson Cod]] ([[Chi McBride]]) and co-worker [[Olive Snook]] ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), Ned uses his abilities to solve murder cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/zap-review-pushingdaisies,0,953387.story|title=TV Review: 'Pushing Daisies'|author=Daniel Fienberg|date=October 3, 2007|work=Zap2It|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> The cast also includes [[Ellen Greene]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]] and [[Field Cate]], with [[Jim Dale]] acting as narrator.\n\nTouted as a \"[[Forensic science|forensic]] [[fairy tale]]\", the series is known for its unusual visual style, eccentric [[Production designer|production design]], quirky characters, fast-paced dialogue and grotesque situations. The series often uses [[wordplay]], [[metaphor]] and [[double entendre]], while Jim Dale's narration is very similar to that of a fairytale.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim and won numerous awards. The series received 17 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, with seven wins, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]] for [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]] for Kristin Chenoweth.

If something is revived for more than one minute, a similar \"life value\" in the vicinity drops dead as a form of balance. If he touches the revived person or thing a second time, they die permanently.\n\nAs a child, he brings back his mother when she dies of an [[aneurysm]]. This causes the death of the father of his neighbor and [[childhood sweetheart]], [[Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles]] ([[Anna Friel]]). That night, Ned's mother falls dead permanently when she kisses him goodnight. Chuck's [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] aunts, [[List of Pushing Daisies characters#Lily and Vivian Charles|Vivian and Lily]] ([[Ellen Greene]] and [[Swoosie Kurtz]], respectively), move in to care for her and Ned is sent by his father to a [[boarding school]], separating the children.\n\nNed becomes a pie-maker and opens a restaurant called The Pie Hole. He is aided by waitress [[Olive Snook]] ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), who pines for him. The restaurant is failing financially when [[private investigator]] [[Emerson Cod]] ([[Chi McBride]]) accidentally discovers Ned's powers and offers a proposal: Ned will temporarily bring murder victims back to life, allowing Emerson to inquire about the circumstances of their death, quickly solve the case, and split the reward money with him.\n\nThe scheme succeeds without issue until they learn that Chuck, whom Ned has not seen since childhood, was murdered. Ned revives her, but he cannot bring himself to let her die permanently. Ned and Chuck fall in love again, and although they can never touch each other, she moves into his home. Chuck joins Ned and Emerson in investigating deaths for reward money, beginning with her own murder.\n\nOver the course of the series, Emerson searches for his missing daughter who was taken away by her mother, a [[Confidence trick|con woman]]. After meeting a publisher of [[pop-up book]]s, he is inspired to create and publish his own pop-up book, hoping that his daughter will read the book and find her way back to him. Chuck struggles to keep the secret of her revival from Vivian and Lily, and Vivian and Lily slowly accept the death of their niece. It is discovered that Chuck is Lily's daughter from an infidelity with Chuck's father while he was engaged to Vivian. Ned revives Chuck's father to ask him questions, and Chuck tricks Ned into thinking he touched her father a second time so that she can keep her father in her life. Chuck's father and Ned have an antagonistic relationship, and Chuck's father asks her to travel the world with him. When she tells him she would rather remain in town, he leaves alone.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that Emerson's daughter returns to him, Chuck is able to let her mother Lily and aunt Vivian know she is alive, and Olive has fallen in love with Ned's friend and opens The Intrepid Cow, a restaurant dedicated to [[macaroni and cheese]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main article|List of Pushing Daisies characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ned (Pushing Daisies)|Ned]], also known as \"The Piemaker\", the owner of the Pie Hole restaurant who has the power to bring back dead people.\n* [[Anna Friel]] as [[Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles]], Ned's childhood sweetheart, murdered by sex snakes, but brought back to life by Ned.\n* [[Chi McBride]] as [[Emerson Cod]], a private investigator and Ned's business partner.\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as [[Olive Snook]], the Pie Hole waitress who is obsessed and hopelessly in love with Ned.\n* [[Ellen Greene]] as [[Vivian Charles]], Chuck's [[agoraphobic]] aunt.\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Lily Charles]], Chuck's other agoraphobic aunt (and birth mother).\n* [[Jim Dale]] as the [[Narrator (Pushing Daisies)|narrator]] of the series.\n* [[Field Cate]] as Young Ned (season 2; recurring season 1), who appears in flashbacks.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as the Coroner, the man in charge of the morgue where most of the murder victims' bodies are stored.\n* [[Sammi Hanratty]] as Young Chuck, who appears in flashbacks.\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Dwight Dixon, a mysterious man connected to both Ned's father and Chuck's father.\n* [[David Arquette]] as Randy Mann, a taxidermist and client of the Pie Hole who is in love with Olive.\n* Nicholas Khayyat as Eugene Mulchandani, Ned's childhood friend who appears in flashbacks.\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Mother Superior, in charge of the [[monastery]] where Olive spends the first episodes of season two.\n* [[Leyna Nguyen]] as a newscaster for Channel 9.\n* [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]] as Simone Hundin, originally a murder suspect in season one, who becomes Emerson Cod's love interest.\n* Jon Eric Price (season one) and [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] (season two) as Ned's father\n* [[Ra\u00fal Esparza]] as Alfredo Aldarisio, a traveling homeopathic antidepressant salesman.\n* [[Josh Randall]] as Charles Charles, Chuck's father.

Circular background shapes, circular windows, and framing shots within circles was a theme seen consistently throughout the series. Symmetry is a common theme used in the visual style, and characters are often framed in windows, doors, or background props. A heavy use of patterns within a location was often used, where a similar pattern would be used in almost the entire location\u2014the wallpaper, window blinds, bedsheets, pillows, furniture, and even clothing, such as Olive's apartment. The series would often use top-down perspectives and over-head shots would showcase its overall visual style. Regardless of the fact that the show focuses on murder investigations, the morgue is painted in candy-cane stripes and many outfits worn by the characters are vibrantly colored, bright, and cheery (for example, Olive's work uniforms alternate between bright orange and lime-green pinstriped dresses, and Emerson is often seen wearing shades of purple).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/296961/design_appreciation_the_sets_of_pushing_daisies.html|title=Design Appreciation: the sets of Pushing Daisies|author=Gaye Birch|date=August 3, 2009|work=Den of Geek!|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Only Ned consistently wears black.\n\nCGI is prominent in the series, with much use of [[chroma key|blue screen]] technology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/filmandvideo/searchlist/8583.html|title=Pushing More Daisies in Less Time|author=Bryant Frazer|date=September 27, 2007|work=Film & Video|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}</ref> (the shop window, similar set pieces and outdoor scenery outside often cast a blue halo tinge) and 3D set-extensions (streets, grass and landscape, the pie shop fa\u00e7ade).

Emerson drives a mid-1960s [[Lincoln Continental]] with [[suicide doors]] in new condition. Ned is seen driving an old, like-new [[Mercedes-Benz W108]].

Together with his formerly deceased childhood crush [[Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles|Chuck]] ([[Anna Friel]]), private investigator [[Emerson Cod]] ([[Chi McBride]]) and co-worker [[Olive Snook]] ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), Ned uses his abilities to solve murder cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/zap-review-pushingdaisies,0,953387.story|title=TV Review: 'Pushing Daisies'|author=Daniel Fienberg|date=October 3, 2007|work=Zap2It|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> The cast also includes [[Ellen Greene]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]] and [[Field Cate]], with [[Jim Dale]] acting as narrator.\n\nTouted as a \"[[Forensic science|forensic]] [[fairy tale]]\", the series is known for its unusual visual style, eccentric [[Production designer|production design]], quirky characters, fast-paced dialogue and grotesque situations. The series often uses [[wordplay]], [[metaphor]] and [[double entendre]], while Jim Dale's narration is very similar to that of a fairytale.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim and won numerous awards. The series received 17 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, with seven wins, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]] for [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]] for Kristin Chenoweth.

If something is revived for more than one minute, a similar \"life value\" in the vicinity drops dead as a form of balance. If he touches the revived person or thing a second time, they die permanently.\n\nAs a child, he brings back his mother when she dies of an [[aneurysm]]. This causes the death of the father of his neighbor and [[childhood sweetheart]], [[Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles]] ([[Anna Friel]]). That night, Ned's mother falls dead permanently when she kisses him goodnight. Chuck's [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] aunts, [[List of Pushing Daisies characters#Lily and Vivian Charles|Vivian and Lily]] ([[Ellen Greene]] and [[Swoosie Kurtz]], respectively), move in to care for her and Ned is sent by his father to a [[boarding school]], separating the children.\n\nNed becomes a pie-maker and opens a restaurant called The Pie Hole. He is aided by waitress [[Olive Snook]] ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), who pines for him. The restaurant is failing financially when [[private investigator]] [[Emerson Cod]] ([[Chi McBride]]) accidentally discovers Ned's powers and offers a proposal: Ned will temporarily bring murder victims back to life, allowing Emerson to inquire about the circumstances of their death, quickly solve the case, and split the reward money with him.\n\nThe scheme succeeds without issue until they learn that Chuck, whom Ned has not seen since childhood, was murdered. Ned revives her, but he cannot bring himself to let her die permanently. Ned and Chuck fall in love again, and although they can never touch each other, she moves into his home. Chuck joins Ned and Emerson in investigating deaths for reward money, beginning with her own murder.\n\nOver the course of the series, Emerson searches for his missing daughter who was taken away by her mother, a [[Confidence trick|con woman]]. After meeting a publisher of [[pop-up book]]s, he is inspired to create and publish his own pop-up book, hoping that his daughter will read the book and find her way back to him. Chuck struggles to keep the secret of her revival from Vivian and Lily, and Vivian and Lily slowly accept the death of their niece. It is discovered that Chuck is Lily's daughter from an infidelity with Chuck's father while he was engaged to Vivian. Ned revives Chuck's father to ask him questions, and Chuck tricks Ned into thinking he touched her father a second time so that she can keep her father in her life. Chuck's father and Ned have an antagonistic relationship, and Chuck's father asks her to travel the world with him. When she tells him she would rather remain in town, he leaves alone.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that Emerson's daughter returns to him, Chuck is able to let her mother Lily and aunt Vivian know she is alive, and Olive has fallen in love with Ned's friend and opens The Intrepid Cow, a restaurant dedicated to [[macaroni and cheese]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main article|List of Pushing Daisies characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ned (Pushing Daisies)|Ned]], also known as \"The Piemaker\", the owner of the Pie Hole restaurant who has the power to bring back dead people.\n* [[Anna Friel]] as [[Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles]], Ned's childhood sweetheart, murdered, but brought back to life by Ned.\n* [[Chi McBride]] as [[Emerson Cod]], a private investigator and Ned's business partner.\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as [[Olive Snook]], the Pie Hole waitress who is obsessed and hopelessly in love with Ned.\n* [[Ellen Greene]] as [[Vivian Charles]], Chuck's [[agoraphobic]] aunt.\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Lily Charles]], Chuck's other agoraphobic aunt (and birth mother).\n* [[Jim Dale]] as the [[Narrator (Pushing Daisies)|narrator]] of the series.\n* [[Field Cate]] as Young Ned (season 2; recurring season 1), who appears in flashbacks.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as the Coroner, the man in charge of the morgue where most of the murder victims' bodies are stored.\n* [[Sammi Hanratty]] as Young Chuck, who appears in flashbacks.\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Dwight Dixon, a mysterious man connected to both Ned's father and Chuck's father.\n* [[David Arquette]] as Randy Mann, a taxidermist and client of the Pie Hole who is in love with Olive.\n* Nicholas Khayyat as Eugene Mulchandani, Ned's childhood friend who appears in flashbacks.\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Mother Superior, in charge of the [[monastery]] where Olive spends the first episodes of season two.\n* [[Leyna Nguyen]] as a newscaster for Channel 9.\n* [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]] as Simone Hundin, originally a murder suspect in season one, who becomes Emerson Cod's love interest.\n* Jon Eric Price (season one) and [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] (season two) as Ned's father\n* [[Ra\u00fal Esparza]] as Alfredo Aldarisio, a traveling homeopathic antidepressant salesman.\n* [[Josh Randall]] as Charles Charles, Chuck's father.

Circular background shapes, circular windows, and framing shots within circles was a theme seen consistently throughout the series. Symmetry is a common theme used in the visual style, and characters are often framed in windows, doors, or background props. A heavy use of patterns within a location was often used, where a similar pattern would be used in almost the entire location\u2014the wallpaper, window blinds, bedsheets, pillows, furniture, and even clothing, such as Olive's apartment. The series would often use top-down perspectives and over-head shots would showcase its overall visual style. Regardless of the fact that the show focuses on murder investigations, the morgue is painted in candy-cane stripes and many outfits worn by the characters are vibrantly colored, bright, and cheery (for example, Olive's work uniforms alternate between bright orange and lime-green pinstriped dresses, and Emerson is often seen wearing shades of purple).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/296961/design_appreciation_the_sets_of_pushing_daisies.html|title=Design Appreciation: the sets of Pushing Daisies|author=Gaye Birch|date=August 3, 2009|work=Den of Geek!|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Only Ned consistently wears black.\n\nCGI is prominent in the series, with much use of [[chroma key|blue screen]] technology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/filmandvideo/searchlist/8583.html|title=Pushing More Daisies in Less Time|author=Bryant Frazer|date=September 27, 2007|work=Film & Video|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}</ref> (the shop window, similar set pieces and outdoor scenery outside often cast a blue halo tinge) and 3D set-extensions (streets, grass and landscape, the pie shop fa\u00e7ade).

With about 5,000 inhabitants, it is among the state's smaller towns. It is also the seat of the [[Freinsheim (Verbandsgemeinde)|like-named ''Verbandsgemeinde'']], a kind of collective municipality.\n\n== Geography ==\nFreinsheim lies in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] at the eastern edge of the [[Palatinate forest]], roughly 20&nbsp;km west of [[Ludwigshafen]] between [[Bad D\u00fcrkheim]] (about 6&nbsp;km to the southwest) and [[Gr\u00fcnstadt]] near the [[German Wine Route]]. Within town limits rises the Fuchsbach.\n\n== History ==\nAs established by various [[Archaeology|archaeological]] finds, Freinsheim's municipal area has been continuously settled by human beings for roughly 5,000 years. An organized community likely existed beginning in the 6th century, as witnessed by the discovery of a [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] linear graveyard. Freinsheim had its first documentary mention in 773 in the Wei\u00dfenburg Monastery's records (this place is now [[Wissembourg]] in [[Alsace]], [[France]]).\n\nIn the 15th century, Freinsheim passed to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], under whose care the existing fortifications were completed. The town wall's most recent building work is the ''\u00e4u\u00dferes Eisentor'' (\u201couter iron gate\u201d), finished in 1514. In 1689, Freinsheim sustained heavy destruction in the [[Nine Years' War]] (known in Germany as the ''Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg'', or War of the Palatine Succession); only foundations were left standing. In the 18th century came reconstruction. Administrative functions within the Electorate of the Palatinate (such as the institution of an ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Unteramt]]'') helped bring about an economic upswing. After the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], Freinsheim passed to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] along with the rest of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] on the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank. Until 1818, Freinsheim belonged to a ''[[Ganerbschaft]]'' (joint inheritance), which comprised the [[House of Leiningen|Leiningen]] villages of Leistadt, [[Herxheim am Berg]] and [[Kallstadt]] as well as the Electorate of the Palatinate villages of Freinsheim and [[Weisenheim am Sand]].<ref name=\"gan\">[http://www.archivdatenbank.lha-rlp.de/speyer/a/a.06/e6/fb/akten/3260/ Akten beim Landeshauptarchiv Speyer]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nA small number of immigrants are known to have moved from Freinsheim to [[Pennsylvania]] in the 18th century, including [[Henry Antes]], a leader of the [[Moravian Church]].<ref name=AntesNom>{{cite web|last=Noble|first=Timothy M.|title=Henry Antes House|url={{NHLS url|id=75001657}}|work=National Historic Landmark Nomination|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=February 17, 2014|year=1991}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], Freinsheim belonged to the newly founded [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It has been seat of the ''[[Verbandsgemeinde]]'' since 1972. With effect from 23 June 1979, given its historical importance, the Rhineland-Palatinate ''Landtag'' bestowed the title ''Stadt'' (\u201ctown\u201d) upon Freinsheim.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat auf [http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/3320201900.html wahlen.rlp.de]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n| || [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || [[Free Voters|FWG]] || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 8 || 5 || 2 || 5 || 20 seats \n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2004 || 8 || 7 || 1 || 4 || 20 seats \n|}\n\n=== Mayors ===\nMatthias Weber (FWG) was elected Stadtb\u00fcrgermeister in June 2016. He is the successor of J\u00fcrgen Oberholz (FWG).<ref>http://www.rheinpfalz.de/lokal/artikel/freinsheim-weber-wird-neuer-buergermeister/</ref>\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Per fess azure a demi-lion rampant sinister Or armed, langued and crowned gules and argent an uppercase letter F of the third between two bunches of grapes in fess of the first.\n\nThe crowned lion symbolizes the historical connection with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], since this [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] was that state's emblem (although it is halved here), while the F is, of course, the town's initial. The two bunches of blue grapes stand for the local [[winegrowing]], which began quite early on with [[red wine]] varieties, which nowadays take up almost half of the cultivated vineyard area within the town.\n\nThe town's earliest seal comes from the early 15th century, and shows the arms borne by the local fiefholders, the Lords of Meckenheim. However, the current arms are based on the town's second seal, dating from 1446. Some versions since that time have shown roses instead of the grapes that appear now.\n\nHistorically, the [[Palatine Lion]] should be shown on a sable (black) field. When these arms were granted, though, the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s were not the traditional Palatine ones, but rather the Bavarian ones, as the town was part of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] at the time.\n\nThe arms have been borne since 1845.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/f/freinshe.htm Description and explanation of Freinsheim's arms]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Freinsheim Wappen am Rathaus.jpg|Town coat of arms\nFile:Hissflagge Freinsheim.svg|Town flag\nFile:Banner Freinsheim.svg|Town \"Banner\" (vertical flag for hoisting from a horizontal pole)\n</gallery>\n\n=== ''Verbandsgemeinde'' ===\nAs seat of the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Freinsheim, Freinsheim is home to its administration. Belonging to the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' are the municipalities of [[Bobenheim am Berg]], [[Dackenheim]], [[Erpolzheim]], [[Herxheim am Berg]], [[Kallstadt]], [[Weisenheim am Berg]] and [[Weisenheim am Sand]].\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\nFreinsheim fosters partnerships with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Marcigny]], [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Buttst\u00e4dt]], [[S\u00f6mmerda (district)|S\u00f6mmerda]], [[Thuringia]]\n\n== Culture and sightseeing==\n\n=== Literature prize ===\nIn memory of one of Freinsheim's most important citizens, the ''Hermann-Sinsheimer-Preis'' has been awarded since 1983. Prizewinners thus far have been, among others, [[Siegfried Lenz]], [[Hilde Domin]], Carola Stern, [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]] and [[Marion Gr\u00e4fin D\u00f6nhoff]].\n\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Freinsheim BW 17.jpg|thumb|The ''Eisentor'' in the town wall]]\n[[File:Freinsheim BW 16.jpg|thumb|Part of the town wall]]\n\n==== Town wall ====\nA particularity of Freinsheim is the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] town wall with its towers and gates, which has been almost wholly preserved and is roughly 1&nbsp;300&nbsp;m long. It forms the basis of the town's historical appearance. Worthiest of note is the outer gate at the ''Eisentor'' (\u201cIron Gate\u201d) with its flanking towers and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] coat of arms. The heart of the town is extraordinarily well restored.\n\n==== Protestant parish church ====\nThe old main church of Freinsheim was, until its destruction in 1689, probably a Late Gothic hall church. Today it has a flat ceiling. The lower floor of the tower is still [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]].\n\n==== Former castle ====\nThe moated castle, which was held by the Electorate of the Palatinate beginning in 1471, lies outside the town wall. The round moat is still filled with water today. The main building standing today is a private house from the early 19th century.\n\n==== Wayside shrine ====\nIn the vineyards on the road to Ungstein stands a Late Gothic [[Wayside shrine|''Bildstock'']] with a Crucifixion group in a frame with a pointed arch. It bears the name ''Schwarzes Kreuz'' (\u201cBlack Cross\u201d), after which one of Freinsheim's wineries has named itself.\n\n==== West tower ====\nThe Romanesque ''Westturm'' at the mountain graveyard south of and somewhat outside the town is a former entrance tower to the likewise Romanesque Chapel of Our Lady on the Mountain. Forms on the west portal suggest an origin in the mid 11th century. The original roofing is no longer present.<ref>Lit.: Eduard Finke, DIE ROMANISCHEN KIRCHT\u00dcRME IN DER PFALZ, Mainz 1994</ref>\n\n=== Regular events ===\n\n==== ''Rotweinwanderweg'' ====\nThe ''Rotweinwanderweg'' (\u201cRed Wine Trail\u201d) is held on the fourth weekend in January. It opens on the Friday at dusk with a torchlight hike on which log torches (''Schwedenfeuer'') are made. On the Saturday and Sunday, the hiking takes place in the daytime, during which local winemakers along the trail through the vineyards around Freinsheim offer hikers selected red wines and dishes to go with them.\n\n==== ''Freinsheimer Altstadtfest'' ====\nEach year on the first weekend in June, the Freinsheim Old Town Festival is held. Its motto is ''Wein und Kultur auf historischen Pl\u00e4tzen'' (\u201cWine and culture on historic squares\u201d). In this, the town of Freinsheim places much importance on sophisticated cultural performances, which are then presented at the marketplace, the ''Retzerhof'' or the ''Saarhof''. As a rule, the festival lasts from Friday to Sunday.\n\n==== ''Stadtmauerfest'' ====\nThe Town Wall Festival held on the third weekend in July in the historic gate is among the region's biggest wine festivals.\n\n==== ''Kulinarischer Weinwanderweg'' ====\nThe Culinary Wine Trail is held on the fourth weekend in September, running through the town's vineyards. Winemakers and gastronomical businesses offer traditional Palatine cooking, Mediterranean dishes, wine and [[Federweisser]].\n\n==== ''Weihnachtsmarkt'' ====\nThe Christmas Market on the four weekends in Advent attracts visitors with its Nativity scene, in which living animals are used.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n=== Economy ===\nAlthough [[winegrowing]] has been edging fruitgrowing out as the town's main agricultural endeavour since the mid 20th century, the town is nevertheless still the seat of one of Germany's great fruit juice producers. Today, Freinsheim is among the [[Palatinate (wine region)|Palatinate]]\u2019s biggest winegrowing centres. Because of the historic Old Town, meanwhile, [[tourism]] has also grown into an important economic factor.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[Freinsheim station]] is at the junction of the ''[[Palatine Northern Railway]]'' ([[Bad D\u00fcrkheim]]\u2013[[Gr\u00fcnstadt]]) and the Freinsheim\u2013Frankenthal [[railway]] line, affording direct links towards [[Neustadt Central Station|Neustadt]], [[Frankenthal Central Station|Frankenthal]] and, by way of [[Gr\u00fcnstadt station|Gr\u00fcnstadt]], to [[Monsheim station|Monsheim]] or [[Ramsen, Rhineland-Palatinate|Ramsen]].\n\nFrom both Neustadt and Frankenthal run long-distance links towards Mannheim, Saarbr\u00fccken and [[Mainz]].\n\nOver the nearby ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 271, Freinsheim is linked to the [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 6|A&nbsp;6]] ([[Mannheim]]\u2013[[Saarbr\u00fccken]]), [[Bundesautobahn 61|A&nbsp;61]] ([[Koblenz]]\u2013[[Speyer]]) and [[Bundesautobahn 65|A&nbsp;65]] ([[Ludwigshafen]]\u2013[[Karlsruhe]]).\n\nExcept on the main thoroughfares (''Landesstra\u00dfen'', or State Roads), the whole town is either a 30&nbsp;km/h zone or a zone with traffic-calming measures in place.\n\n== Famous people ==\n\n=== Sons and daughters of the town ===\n[[File:Philipp Lorenz Geiger.jpg|thumb|150px|Philipp Lorenz Geiger]]\n* [[Jacob Gottfried Weber]] (1779\u20131839), trained jurist, was a musician at the Mannheim Conservatory.\n* [[Philipp Lorenz Geiger]] (1785\u20131836), chemist and pharmacist\n* Philipp Tillmann (1809\u2013died after 1881), politician\n* [[Philipp Merkle]] (1811\u20131899), German-American Freethinker and preacher\n* Hermann Sinsheimer (1883\u20131950), journalist and jurist, was editor-in-chief of [[Simplicissimus]]; in his honour Freinsheim awards the ''Hermann-Sinsheimer-Preis''.

With about 5,000 inhabitants, it is among the state's smaller towns. It is also the seat of the [[Freinsheim (Verbandsgemeinde)|like-named ''Verbandsgemeinde'']], a kind of collective municipality.\n\n== Geography ==\nFreinsheim lies in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] at the eastern edge of the [[Palatinate forest]], roughly 20&nbsp;km west of [[Ludwigshafen]] between [[Bad D\u00fcrkheim]] (about 6&nbsp;km to the southwest) and [[Gr\u00fcnstadt]] near the [[German Wine Route]]. Within town limits rises the Fuchsbach.\n\n== History ==\nAs established by various [[Archaeology|archaeological]] finds, Freinsheim's municipal area has been continuously settled by human beings for roughly 5,000 years. An organized community likely existed beginning in the 6th century, as witnessed by the discovery of a [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] linear graveyard. Freinsheim had its first documentary mention in 773 in the Wei\u00dfenburg Monastery's records (this place is now [[Wissembourg]] in [[Alsace]], [[France]]).\n\nIn the 15th century, Freinsheim passed to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], under whose care the existing fortifications were completed. The town wall's most recent building work is the ''\u00e4u\u00dferes Eisentor'' (\u201couter iron gate\u201d), finished in 1514. In 1689, Freinsheim sustained heavy destruction in the [[Nine Years' War]] (known in Germany as the ''Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg'', or War of the Palatine Succession); only foundations were left standing. In the 18th century came reconstruction. Administrative functions within the Electorate of the Palatinate (such as the institution of an ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Unteramt]]'') helped bring about an economic upswing. After the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], Freinsheim passed to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] along with the rest of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] on the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank. Until 1818, Freinsheim belonged to a ''[[Ganerbschaft]]'' (joint inheritance), which comprised the [[House of Leiningen|Leiningen]] villages of Leistadt, [[Herxheim am Berg]] and [[Kallstadt]] as well as the Electorate of the Palatinate villages of Freinsheim and [[Weisenheim am Sand]].<ref name=\"gan\">[http://www.archivdatenbank.lha-rlp.de/speyer/a/a.06/e6/fb/akten/3260/ Akten beim Landeshauptarchiv Speyer]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nA small number of immigrants are known to have moved from Freinsheim to [[Pennsylvania]] in the 18th century, including [[Henry Antes]], a leader of the [[Moravian Church]].<ref name=AntesNom>{{cite web|last=Noble|first=Timothy M.|title=Henry Antes House|url={{NHLS url|id=75001657}}|work=National Historic Landmark Nomination|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=February 17, 2014|year=1991}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], Freinsheim belonged to the newly founded [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It has been seat of the ''[[Verbandsgemeinde]]'' since 1972. With effect from 23 June 1979, given its historical importance, the Rhineland-Palatinate ''Landtag'' bestowed the title ''Stadt'' (\u201ctown\u201d) upon Freinsheim.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat auf [http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/3320201900.html wahlen.rlp.de]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n| || [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || [[Free Voters|FWG]] || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 8 || 5 || 2 || 5 || 20 seats \n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2004 || 8 || 7 || 1 || 4 || 20 seats \n|}\n\n=== Mayors ===\nMatthias Weber (FWG) was elected Stadtb\u00fcrgermeister in June 2016. He is the successor of J\u00fcrgen Oberholz (FWG).<ref>http://www.rheinpfalz.de/lokal/artikel/freinsheim-weber-wird-neuer-buergermeister/</ref>\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Per fess azure a demi-lion rampant sinister Or armed, langued and crowned gules and argent an uppercase letter F of the third between two bunches of grapes in fess of the first.\n\nThe crowned lion symbolizes the historical connection with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], since this [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] was that state's emblem (although it is halved here), while the F is, of course, the town's initial. The two bunches of blue grapes stand for the local [[winegrowing]], which began quite early on with [[red wine]] varieties, which nowadays take up almost half of the cultivated vineyard area within the town.\n\nThe town's earliest seal comes from the early 15th century, and shows the arms borne by the local fiefholders, the Lords of Meckenheim. However, the current arms are based on the town's second seal, dating from 1446. Some versions since that time have shown roses instead of the grapes that appear now.\n\nHistorically, the [[Palatine Lion]] should be shown on a sable (black) field. When these arms were granted, though, the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s were not the traditional Palatine ones, but rather the Bavarian ones, as the town was part of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] at the time.\n\nThe arms have been borne since 1845.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/f/freinshe.htm Description and explanation of Freinsheim's arms]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Freinsheim Wappen am Rathaus.jpg|Town coat of arms\nFile:Hissflagge Freinsheim.svg|Town flag\nFile:Banner Freinsheim.svg|Town \"Banner\" (vertical flag for hoisting from a horizontal pole)\n</gallery>\n\n=== ''Verbandsgemeinde'' ===\nAs seat of the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Freinsheim, Freinsheim is home to its administration. Belonging to the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' are the municipalities of [[Bobenheim am Berg]], [[Dackenheim]], [[Erpolzheim]], [[Herxheim am Berg]], [[Kallstadt]], [[Weisenheim am Berg]] and [[Weisenheim am Sand]].\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\nFreinsheim fosters partnerships with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Marcigny]], [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Buttst\u00e4dt]], [[S\u00f6mmerda (district)|S\u00f6mmerda]], [[Thuringia]]\n\n== Culture and sightseeing==\n\n=== Literature prize ===\nIn memory of one of Freinsheim's most important citizens, the ''Hermann-Sinsheimer-Preis'' has been awarded since 1983. Prizewinners thus far have been, among others, [[Siegfried Lenz]], [[Hilde Domin]], Carola Stern, [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]] and [[Marion Gr\u00e4fin D\u00f6nhoff]].\n\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Freinsheim BW 17.jpg|thumb|The ''Eisentor'' in the town wall]]\n[[File:Freinsheim BW 16.jpg|thumb|Part of the town wall]]\n\n==== Town wall ====\nA particularity of Freinsheim is the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] town wall with its towers and gates, which has been almost wholly preserved and is roughly 1&nbsp;300&nbsp;m long. It forms the basis of the town's historical appearance. Worthiest of note is the outer gate at the ''Eisentor'' (\u201cIron Gate\u201d) with its flanking towers and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] coat of arms. The heart of the town is extraordinarily well restored.\n\n==== Protestant parish church ====\nThe old main church of Freinsheim was, until its destruction in 1689, probably a Late Gothic hall church. Today it has a flat ceiling. The lower floor of the tower is still [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]].\n\n==== Former castle ====\nThe moated castle, which was held by the Electorate of the Palatinate beginning in 1471, lies outside the town wall.

The film stars [[James Karen]] as Michael Kenneth Marshall, a young medical student who goes through medical training at Columbia and Cornell.

This case inspires him to enroll in the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] and pursue a career in public health. While studying at Johns Hopkins, Marshall helps battle an outbreak of diphtheria in [[Baltimore]], which confirms to him his chosen vocation.\n\nThe film was made by the [[United States Information Agency|United States Information Service]] for use by the U.S. State Department.

With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived [[vertebrates]]. A captive individual lived at least 170&nbsp;years.

On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with \"saddleback\" shells and long necks. [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] observations of these differences on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] in 1835, contributed to the [[Evolution|development of his theory of evolution]].\n\nTortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by [[overexploitation]] of the species for meat and oil, [[Habitat destruction|habitat clearance]] for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. 10 species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species (''[[Chelonoidis abingdonii]]'') had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed [[Lonesome George]] until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, all surviving species are classified as \"threatened\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Early classification===\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], around 1570.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=P.D. |title=Gal\u00e1pagos: the islands that changed the world |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2006 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-300-12230-5}}</ref> The islands were named \"Insulae de los Galopegos\" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.<ref name=Pritchard1996P17>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Michael Hume | title = Gal\u00e1pagos, a natural history | publisher = University of Calgary Press | location = Calgary | year = 1993 | page = [https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 1] | isbn = 978-1-895176-07-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 }}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The first navigation chart showing the individual islands was drawn up by the pirate [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1684.

It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species (''C. becki'') while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (''C. guentheri'') and therefore form the species ''C. vandenburghi'' (Alcedo) and ''C. microphyes'' (Darwin).<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\">{{cite journal|author1=Ciofi, Claudio |author2=Wilson, Gregory A. |author3=Beheregaray, Luciano B. |author4=Marquez, Cruz |author5=Gibbs, James P. |author6=Tapia, Washington |author7=Snell, Howard L. |author8=Caccone, Adalgisa |author9=Powell, Jeffrey R. |year=2006|title=Phylogeographic history and gene flow among giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises on southern Isabela Island |journal= Genetics| volume =172|issue=3|pages=1727\u20131744|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.047860|pmid=16387883|pmc=1456292}}</ref> The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (''C. vicina'') is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/> Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/>\n\n;Floreana Island\nPhylogenetic analysis may help to \"resurrect\" the extinct species of Floreana (''C. nigra'') \u2013 a species known only from [[subfossil]] remains.<ref name='S1986'>{{cite journal |last=Steadman |first=David W. |year=1986 |title=Holocene vertebrate fossils from Isla Floreana, Gal\u00e1pagos |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=413 |pages=1\u2013103 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.413 |issue=413 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2092bae7e25dcbc19d0ac33de03210b0672e8d57 }}</ref> Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela,<ref name='Poulakakis 2008'/> resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands,<ref name=Pritchard1996P65>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=65}}</ref> or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load.<ref name='B1889'/> Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring.

Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.\n\nIn 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinz\u00f3n Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinz\u00f3n sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, [[Island Conservation]], Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinz\u00f3n tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinz\u00f3n tortoise nests on the island and the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinz\u00f3n Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinz\u00f3n and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.islandconservation.org/pinzon-island/|title=Pinz\u00f3n Island, Gal\u00e1pagos \u2013 Island Conservation|work=Island Conservation|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n;Espa\u00f1ola\n\nOn the southern island of Espa\u00f1ola, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females.  The tortoises apparently were not encountering one another, so no reproduction was occurring.  Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated.

With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived [[vertebrates]]. A captive individual lived at least 170&nbsp;years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish ''[[wiktionary:gal\u00e1pago#Spanish|gal\u00e1pago]]'', meaning \"tortoise\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/GALAPAGO.HTM |title=On the Origin of <s>Species</s> 'Gal\u00e1pago' |last1=Woram |first1=John |date= n.d.|website=Las Encantadas: Human and Cartographic History of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands |publisher=Rockville Press, Inc. |access-date=21 September 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[Turtle shell|Shell]] size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with \"saddleback\" shells and long necks. [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] observations of these differences on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] in 1835, contributed to the [[Evolution|development of his theory of evolution]].\n\nTortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by [[overexploitation]] of the species for meat and oil, [[Habitat destruction|habitat clearance]] for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. 10 species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species (''[[Chelonoidis abingdonii]]'') had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed [[Lonesome George]] until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, all surviving species are classified as \"threatened\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Early classification===\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], around 1570.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=P.D. |title=Gal\u00e1pagos: the islands that changed the world |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2006 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-300-12230-5}}</ref> The islands were named \"Insulae de los Galopegos\" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.<ref name=Pritchard1996P17>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Michael Hume | title = Gal\u00e1pagos, a natural history | publisher = University of Calgary Press | location = Calgary | year = 1993 | page = [https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 1] | isbn = 978-1-895176-07-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 }}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The first navigation chart showing the individual islands was drawn up by the pirate [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1684.

It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species (''C. becki'') while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (''C. guentheri'') and therefore form the species ''C. vandenburghi'' (Alcedo) and ''C. microphyes'' (Darwin).<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\">{{cite journal|author1=Ciofi, Claudio |author2=Wilson, Gregory A. |author3=Beheregaray, Luciano B. |author4=Marquez, Cruz |author5=Gibbs, James P. |author6=Tapia, Washington |author7=Snell, Howard L. |author8=Caccone, Adalgisa |author9=Powell, Jeffrey R. |year=2006|title=Phylogeographic history and gene flow among giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises on southern Isabela Island |journal= Genetics| volume =172|issue=3|pages=1727\u20131744|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.047860|pmid=16387883|pmc=1456292}}</ref> The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (''C. vicina'') is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/> Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/>\n\n;Floreana Island\nPhylogenetic analysis may help to \"resurrect\" the extinct species of Floreana (''C. nigra'') \u2013 a species known only from [[subfossil]] remains.<ref name='S1986'>{{cite journal |last=Steadman |first=David W. |year=1986 |title=Holocene vertebrate fossils from Isla Floreana, Gal\u00e1pagos |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=413 |pages=1\u2013103 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.413 |issue=413 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2092bae7e25dcbc19d0ac33de03210b0672e8d57 }}</ref> Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela,<ref name='Poulakakis 2008'/> resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands,<ref name=Pritchard1996P65>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=65}}</ref> or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load.<ref name='B1889'/> Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring.

Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.\n\nIn 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinz\u00f3n Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinz\u00f3n sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, [[Island Conservation]], Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinz\u00f3n tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinz\u00f3n tortoise nests on the island and the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinz\u00f3n Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinz\u00f3n and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.islandconservation.org/pinzon-island/|title=Pinz\u00f3n Island, Gal\u00e1pagos \u2013 Island Conservation|work=Island Conservation|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n;Espa\u00f1ola\n\nOn the southern island of Espa\u00f1ola, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females.

Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated.

Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using \"Judas\" goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the \"Judas\" and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. Goats were removed from Pinta Island after a 30-year eradication campaign, the largest removal of an insular goat population using ground-based methods. Over 41,000 goats were removed during the initial hunting effort (1971\u201382).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell|first1=Karl |last2=Donlan|first2=C.

Its goal is to assist the Galapagos National Park to effectively conserve giant tortoises by conducting cutting-edge applied science, and developing an inspirational tortoise-based outreach and education programme. Since 2009, the project team have been analysing the movements of giant tortoises by tracking them via satellite tags. As of November 2014, the team have tagged 83 tortoises from four species on three islands. They have established that giant tortoises conduct migrations up and down volcanoes, primarily in response to seasonal changes in the availability and quality of vegetation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gianttortoise.org/tortoise_site_oct_2013_004.htm |publisher=Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme |title=GTMEP: What We Do |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210061653/http://gianttortoise.org/tortoise_site_oct_2013_004.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015  }}</ref> In 2015 they will start to track the movements of hatchling and juvenile tortoises, supported by the UK's [[Galapagos Conservation Trust]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://galapagosconservation.org.uk/ |publisher= <!-- Galapagos Conservation Trust --> |title= Galapagos Conservation Trust |accessdate=2014-12-23}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Reptiles}}\n* [[List of species of Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]\n* [[Gal\u00e1pagos wildlife]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Anchor|CITEREFChambers2004}}{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=A sheltered life: the unexpected history of the giant tortoise |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-6528-1}}\n* {{Anchor|CITEREFDarwin1839}}{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=2009 |origyear=1839 |title=Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

She also was named a 2000 Parade Magazine First Team All-American in 2000 and the Arizona Player of the Century by the Arizona Republic.  She participated in the 2000 [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association#WBCA High School All-America Game|WBCA High School All-America Game]] where she scored fourteen points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/>\n\nIn addition, Powell during her high school years earned all-region selection in both tennis and track, won the state badminton singles championships in 1997, 1999 and 2000, won the state discus title in 2000, and was an Arizona 5A doubles runner-up in tennis in 2000.\n\n==College==\nPowell played the [[Basketball#Positions|forward position]] for [[Stanford University]] women's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball team. During her tenure there, she broke many school records, was named an All-American three times, and won numerous awards. She majored in [[urban development|urban studies]].\n\nShe was the first women's basketball player in the history of what is now the [[Pac-12 Conference]] to have achieved multiple [[triple-double]] games (that is, 10 totals or more in three different statistical categories) during the same season. Powell has since been joined by two other players: [[Brittany Boyd]] of [[California Golden Bears women's basketball|California]], who recorded two triple-doubles in the 2014\u201315 season, and [[Sabrina Ionescu]] of [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]], who had multiple triple-doubles in all four of her college seasons (four in 2016\u201317, six in 2017\u201318, and eight in both 2018\u201319 and 2019\u201320).<ref name=\"NCAA records\">{{Cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_basketball_RB/2020/Triple-Doubles.pdf |title=Division I Women's Basketball Triple-Doubles History |work=2019\u201320 NCAA Women's Basketball Records |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |date=2019 |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/28162685/the-ultimate-guide-oregon-women-basketball-star-sabrina-ionescu |title=The ultimate guide to Oregon women's basketball star Sabrina Ionescu |website=ESPN.com |date=February 24, 2020 |accessdate=February 24, 2020}}</ref> Powell and Ionescu are also the only NCAA Division I women's players to have recorded multiple triple-doubles in the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]]; Powell had two consecutive triple-doubles in 2002, while Ionescu had one each in 2018 and 2019.<ref name=\"NCAA records\"/>\n\n==Coaching==\nPowell spent one season, 2013-14, at Gonzaga as an assistant coach for coach [[Kelly Graves]]. After Graves accepted the head coaching position for the [[University of Oregon]], Powell took the assistant coach position at Oregon for three years. The 2016-2017 season was the most successful under Powell's assistant coaching career; it included a top-five recruiting class in 2016, headlined by Ionescu; a run to the Elite 8 in the 2017 NCAA Tournament; winning 6 out of 23 games against Top 25 opponents; and finishing the season at #16. \n\nIn April 2017, Powell accepted the head coaching position at Grand Canyon University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gculopes.com/coaches.aspx?rc=931&path=wbball|title=GCU Women's Basketball: Nicole Powell|publisher=GCULopes.com|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Stanford statistics===\nSource<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careerplayer|title=NCAA Statistics|website=web1.ncaa.org|access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Year\n|Team\n|GP\n|Points\n|FG%\n|3P%\n|FT%\n|RPG\n|APG\n|SPG\n|BPG\n|PPG\n|-\n|2001-02\n|Stanford\n|'''35'''\n|581\n|'''49.0%'''\n|'''42.0%'''\n|82.6%\n|9.3\n|'''6.3'''\n|1.6\n|0.3\n|16.6\n|-\n|2002-03\n|Stanford\n|23\n|432\n|48.1%\n|40.4%\n|'''87.5%'''\n|9.3\n|3.8\n|1.8\n|'''0.6'''\n|18.8\n|-\n|2003-04\n|Stanford\n|31\n|'''627'''\n|42.9%\n|36.0%\n|85.6%\n|'''11.2'''\n|4.1\n|'''1.9'''\n|0.5\n|'''20.2'''\n|-\n|Career\n|\n|89\n|1640\n|46.3%\n|39.3%\n|85.1%\n|10.0\n|4.9\n|1.8\n|0.5\n|18.4\n|}\n\n==WNBA career==\nPowell was picked No. 3 overall by the [[Charlotte Sting]] in the 2004 [[WNBA Draft]]. She was used by the Sting as a utility player, appearing in 31 games.\n\nOn March 3, 2005, she was traded to the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] in a multi-player deal. The trade greatly aided the Monarchs in the 2005 season while Powell enjoyed a breakout year and eventually was named the recipient of that year's [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|WNBA's Most Improved Player award]]. She played a pivotal role in the Monarchs' 2005 [[WNBA Finals]] victory over the [[Connecticut Sun]].\n\nAlthough the Monarchs struggled in subsequent years, Powell's statistics continued to improve.  In 2009, with several of her teammates hobbled by injuries, Powell averaged 16.7 points per game and was the best free throw shooter in the WNBA with 97.9% of attempts made.  She also participated in the 2009 WNBA All-Star Game, where she scored 21 points off the bench.\n\nThe Monarchs ceased operations following their 2009 season.  The New York Liberty selected Nicole Powell with the first pick in the ensuing dispersal draft.  She was traded to the Tulsa Shock before the 2013 season and signed with the Seattle Storm before the 2014 season.\n\n==USA Basketball==\nPowell was a member of the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|USA Women's U18]] team which won the gold medal at the FIBA Americas Championship in [[Mar Del Plata]], [[Argentina]]. The event was held in July 2000, when the USA team defeated Cuba to win the championship. Powell averaged 8.2 points per game and led the team in rebounding with 6.4 per game.<ref name=\"2000 U18\"/>\n\nPowell was named to the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|USA Women's U19]] team which represented the USA in the 2001 U19 World's Championship, held in [[Brno, Czech Republic]] in July 2001. Powell scored 7.0 points per game, led the team in rebounding with 6.3 per game to help the USA team to a 6\u20131 record and the bronze medal.<ref name=\"2001 U19\"/>\n\nIn 2003, Powell helped the United States women's national basketball team win a [[silver medal]] at the [[Pan American Games]] in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]].<ref name=\"2003 Pan Am\"/> She also helped national teams win a [[bronze medal]] (in the [[Czech Republic]]) and a [[gold medal]] (in [[Argentina]]) at two other international tournaments.\n\n==International career==\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010 WNBA off-season, Powell contributed to Fenerbah\u00e7e's victories each year in the Turkish women's basketball league championship.  In 2007\u20132008 she played for CSKA Moscow in Russia, in 2006\u20132007 for Perfumerias Halcon Avenida in Spain, in 2005\u20132006 for Fenerbah\u00e7e for the first time, also winning the country's championship, and 2004\u20132005 Basket Spezia in Italy.

basketball coach who is currently the head women\u2019s basketball coach at [[UC Riverside Highlanders women's basketball|University of California, Riverside]]. As a player, she had a standout collegiate career at [[Stanford University]], Powell had an 11-year [[WNBA]] career most notably with the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] where she was an All-Star and won a WNBA Championship. Powell also played professionally overseas for [[Fenerbah\u00e7e Women's Basketball|Fenerbah\u00e7e Istanbul]].<ref name=\"fenerbahce\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swishappeal.com/2017/4/8/15226846/sources-grand-canyon-hires-nicole-powell-ncaaw|title=Sources: Lopes to hire Oregon assistant Nicole Powell|date=April 8, 2017|website=Swish Appeal|access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref> Powell had previously served on the coaching staffs at Gonzaga, Oregon, and Grand Canyon before being named the head coach of UC Riverside in March 2020.\n\n==High school==\nBorn in [[Sierra Vista, Arizona]], Powell played for [[Mountain Pointe High School]] in Phoenix, where she was named a [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American. She also was named a 2000 Parade Magazine First Team All-American in 2000 and the Arizona Player of the Century by the Arizona Republic.  She participated in the 2000 [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association#WBCA High School All-America Game|WBCA High School All-America Game]] where she scored fourteen points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/>\n\nIn addition, Powell during her high school years earned all-region selection in both tennis and track, won the state badminton singles championships in 1997, 1999 and 2000, won the state discus title in 2000, and was an Arizona 5A doubles runner-up in tennis in 2000.\n\n==College==\nPowell played the [[Basketball#Positions|forward position]] for [[Stanford University]] women's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball team. During her tenure there, she broke many school records, was named an All-American three times, and won numerous awards. She majored in [[urban development|urban studies]].\n\nShe was the first women's basketball player in the history of what is now the [[Pac-12 Conference]] to have achieved multiple [[triple-double]] games (that is, 10 totals or more in three different statistical categories) during the same season. Powell has since been joined by two other players: [[Brittany Boyd]] of [[California Golden Bears women's basketball|California]], who recorded two triple-doubles in the 2014\u201315 season, and [[Sabrina Ionescu]] of [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]], who has had multiple triple-doubles in all four of her college seasons (four in 2016\u201317, six in 2017\u201318, eight in both 2018\u201319 and 2019\u201320).<ref name=\"NCAA records\">{{Cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_basketball_RB/2020/Triple-Doubles.pdf |title=Division I Women's Basketball Triple-Doubles History |work=2019\u201320 NCAA Women's Basketball Records |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |date=2019 |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/28162685/the-ultimate-guide-oregon-women-basketball-star-sabrina-ionescu |title=The ultimate guide to Oregon women's basketball star Sabrina Ionescu |website=ESPN.com |date=February 24, 2020 |accessdate=February 24, 2020}}</ref> Powell and Ionescu are also the only NCAA Division I women's players to have recorded multiple triple-doubles in the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]]; Powell had two consecutive triple-doubles in 2002, while Ionescu had one each in 2018 and 2019.<ref name=\"NCAA records\"/>\n\n==Coaching==\nPowell spent one season, 2013-14, at Gonzaga as an assistant coach for coach [[Kelly Graves]]. After Graves accepted the head coaching position for the [[University of Oregon]], Powell took the assistant coach position at Oregon for three years. The 2016-2017 season was the most successful under Powell's assistant coaching career; it included a top-five recruiting class in 2016, headlined by Ionescu; a run to the Elite 8 in the 2017 NCAA Tournament; winning 6 out of 23 games against Top 25 opponents; and finishing the season at #16. \n\nIn April 2017, Powell accepted the head coaching position at Grand Canyon University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gculopes.com/coaches.aspx?rc=931&path=wbball|title=GCU Women's Basketball: Nicole Powell|publisher=GCULopes.com|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Stanford statistics===\nSource<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careerplayer|title=NCAA Statistics|website=web1.ncaa.org|access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Year\n|Team\n|GP\n|Points\n|FG%\n|3P%\n|FT%\n|RPG\n|APG\n|SPG\n|BPG\n|PPG\n|-\n|2001-02\n|Stanford\n|'''35'''\n|581\n|'''49.0%'''\n|'''42.0%'''\n|82.6%\n|9.3\n|'''6.3'''\n|1.6\n|0.3\n|16.6\n|-\n|2002-03\n|Stanford\n|23\n|432\n|48.1%\n|40.4%\n|'''87.5%'''\n|9.3\n|3.8\n|1.8\n|'''0.6'''\n|18.8\n|-\n|2003-04\n|Stanford\n|31\n|'''627'''\n|42.9%\n|36.0%\n|85.6%\n|'''11.2'''\n|4.1\n|'''1.9'''\n|0.5\n|'''20.2'''\n|-\n|Career\n|\n|89\n|1640\n|46.3%\n|39.3%\n|85.1%\n|10.0\n|4.9\n|1.8\n|0.5\n|18.4\n|}\n\n==WNBA career==\nPowell was picked No. 3 overall by the [[Charlotte Sting]] in the 2004 [[WNBA Draft]]. She was used by the Sting as a utility player, appearing in 31 games.\n\nOn March 3, 2005, she was traded to the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] in a multi-player deal. The trade greatly aided the Monarchs in the 2005 season while Powell enjoyed a breakout year and eventually was named the recipient of that year's [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|WNBA's Most Improved Player award]]. She played a pivotal role in the Monarchs' 2005 [[WNBA Finals]] victory over the [[Connecticut Sun]].\n\nAlthough the Monarchs struggled in subsequent years, Powell's statistics continued to improve.  In 2009, with several of her teammates hobbled by injuries, Powell averaged 16.7 points per game and was the best free throw shooter in the WNBA with 97.9% of attempts made.  She also participated in the 2009 WNBA All-Star Game, where she scored 21 points off the bench.\n\nThe Monarchs ceased operations following their 2009 season.  The New York Liberty selected Nicole Powell with the first pick in the ensuing dispersal draft.  She was traded to the Tulsa Shock before the 2013 season and signed with the Seattle Storm before the 2014 season.\n\n==USA Basketball==\nPowell was a member of the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|USA Women's U18]] team which won the gold medal at the FIBA Americas Championship in [[Mar Del Plata]], [[Argentina]].

In 2007\u20132008 she played for CSKA Moscow in Russia, in 2006\u20132007 for Perfumerias Halcon Avenida in Spain, in 2005\u20132006 for Fenerbah\u00e7e for the first time, also winning the country's championship, and 2004\u20132005 Basket Spezia in Italy.
