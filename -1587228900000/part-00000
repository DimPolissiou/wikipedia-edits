If you want episode-by-episode details, create an episode list.-->\n\n===Episode 1-166===\nTwin sisters Vani and Rani ([[Raadhika]]), after the loss of their parents are brought up by their paternal uncle, Manikkam ([[Ravikumar]]). Vani aspires to become a lawyer, therefore Rani sacrifices her education so that Manikkam will make Vani a lawyer. Over the years, Vani passes out as a successful Lawyer and marries Bhoominathan ([[Venu Arvind]]), a granite businessman, while Rani marries Bhoominathan's stepbrother, Swaminathan ([[Babloo Prithiveeraj]]), a popular restaurant owner. Meanwhile, Manikkam's son, Manohar (Sivaji Manohar) falls in love with Bhoominathan's sister, Jyothi (Premi Venkat) and elopes with her, where Rani is forced to marry, earning Vaani and Rani the wrath of both their uncle and their mother-in-law, Angayarkanni ([[Shanthi Williams]]), while Vani refuses to speak with Rani thereafter.\n\n===Episode 167-433===\nOver the years, Vani and Bhoominathan turn out to be very successful, while Rani and Swaminathan are not too successful since all of Swaminathan's business turn out to be failures. However, they all live together in the same house. Vani has two sons, Surya Narayanan (Arun Kumar Rajan), an unemployed and childlike lawyer and Gautham (Vignesh Kumar), the college guy, while Rani has three children, Saravanan (Maanas Chavali), Selvi (Niranjani Asok) and Thenmozhi (Neha). Problems continue to erupt in the house due to Bhoominathan's ego against his stepbrother, while the entrance of Angayarkanni, who is jealous of Vani and Rani's close relationship despite Vani's refusal to ever directly address Rani, further worsens the problems, by conspiring against them and trying to separate them. Meanwhile, Selvi falls in love and under dire circumstances, marries Rajesh (Guhan Shanmugam) with only Vani as a chance witness, causing a rift in the family, and their eventual separation, resulting in Vani and Rani to get separated. However, Bhoominathan later realises his faults, turns over a new leaf and sends his mother away and tries to get the family together.\n\n===Episode 434-1200===\nThey get together but live in separate houses. However, problems continue to haunt them in the form of a vengeful Angayarkanni and Jyothi and Kadhir, a local don who has his vengeance against Saravanan. Gautham threatens Kadhir to leave his family alone. After many incidentes and obstacles Gautham marries Pooja to rescue Saravanan from Kadhir. Kadhir turns into a good man after Pooja's marriage. While Jyothi's daughter Poongodi (Mahalakshmi) is involved in a love triangle between Karthi (Rajkumar), and Saravanan. Selvi also faces numerous problems through her father in law, Kaali (Baboos), Alamelu and Shenbagam (Sumangali and Shreedevi), Shiva (Jai Ram) and Geetha, and later on through Kaali's daughter, Malathy (Minnal Deepa). Surya marries Dimple. She hates Vani and does everything against her mother-in-law. Surya and also Dimple wanted to divorce each other several times, but at the end, Vani was able to bring back them together. Gautham becomes a police man and investigates a murder that took place in a quarry which was owned by a doctor known as GP (Tarun Master). GP is also a big business magnate who controls the Indian medicine mafia activity and his son Arya (Fawaz Zayani) was a big criminal dealing in international illegal organ mafia activities. Then due to rage of Gautham killing Arya, GP vows to destroy Vaani's family and that will lead Pooja's uncle Kathir to revenge GP by mysteriously killing GP's henchmen and trying to destroy his businesses and his criminal network. GP tried killing Kathir but finally got arrested by Gautham. Saravanan marries Pavithra (Shruthi Shanmuga Priya).\n\n=== Episode 1200 - 1743 ===\n\nRivalry started between Vani and Akilandeswari ([[Mamilla Shailaja Priya]]) because of Surya's relationship with her daughter Janani (Priya) during college days. They had a daughter named Riya. Janani was murdered by Sudhakar, Akilandeswari's brother but he made Vani as the victim. So, Akilandeswari wanted to take revenge against Vani and Rani family. Meanwhile in Australia, Swaminathan had a relationship with kokila who actually died. Her jealous aunt Krishnaveni ([[Nalini (actress)|Nalini]]) wanted to amuse his wealth which was given by kokila's dad, with the help of Jessy who looks like kokila. Rani saved the wealth. After a  sequence of events, Thenu fell down from a hill top and lost her memories. She rescued by Chandrika ([[Madhuvanti Arun]]) and her brother. Chandrika treats her like own daughter Bhavani who died by jumping from the hill and she never wanted to give back Thenu to Rani. Akilandeswari helped her and started blackmailing Rani and forced her smuggle drugs but finally with the help of Rani and Vani, Thenu regained her memory. Then Akilandeswari and Sudhakar started a new plan with the help of Neela and Sanjay. Neela blackmails Saravanan and Surya in one way to take money from them and Sanjay takes Bhomminathan's company with the help of Sudhakar and creates a confusion between Swaminathan and Bhoominathan. Meanwhile Angayarkanni was murdered by Sanjay and made Swaminathan as the victim. Bhoominathan and Jyothi believed that Swami is the person who murdered their mother and a fight occurs between Bhoominathan and Swaminathan. After some turns of events, Sanjay plans to murder Swaminathan and Rani. At that time the evidence that Sanjay was the murder of Angayarkanni which was kept in a doll is taken away by Riya and finally the evidence reaches Swaminathan and Rani. Both of them blackmail Sanjay by telling him that they have given poison and Swaminathan brings back Bhoominathan's company to him and it is proved that Sanjay is the actual murderer. Hence, Bhoominathan and Swaminathan reunite with each other. But Akhilandeshwari tries to kill Vaani by an lorry accident. Raani comes to know about this plan and she goes in disguise of Vaani. Lorry hits Rani and she is admitted in hospital. At the climax Akiladeshwari came to know about Sudhakar being the murderer of Janani with the help of Gautham. Here ,after hearing the situation of Raani, Vani faints. After some emotional affection between the sisters, their health improves. Akilandeshwari is arrested by Gautham before that she apologizes for all of her mistakes to both Vani and Rani. Then the family lives happily thereafter.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{cleanup|section|date=November 2019|reason=Section is not consistent with [[WP:TVCAST]].

Vani aspires to become a lawyer, therefore Rani sacrifices her education so that Manikkam will make Vani a lawyer. Over the years, Vani passes out as a successful Lawyer and gets married to Bhoominathan ([[Venu Arvind]]), a granite businessman, while Rani gets married to Bhoominathan's stepbrother, Swaminathan ([[Babloo Prithiveeraj]]), a popular restaurant owner. Meanwhile, Manikkam's son, Manohar (Sivaji Manohar) falls in love with Bhoominathan's sister, Jyothi (Premi Venkat) and elopes with her, where Rani is forced to marry, which causes several problems, and results in Vaani and Rani earning the wrath of both their uncle and their mother-in-law, Angayarkanni ([[Shanthi Williams]]), while Vani refuses to speak with Rani thereafter.\n\n===Episode 167-433===\nOver the years, Vani and Bhoominathan turn out to be very successful, while Rani and Swaminathan are not too successful since all of Swaminathan's business turn out to be failures. However, they all live together in the same house. Vani has two sons, Surya Narayanan (Arun Kumar Rajan), an unemployed and childlike lawyer and Gautham (Vignesh Kumar), the college guy, while Rani has three children, Saravanan (Maanas Chavali), Selvi (Niranjani Asok) and Thenmozhi (Neha). Problems continue to erupt in the house due to Bhoominathan's ego against his stepbrother, while the entrance of Angayarkanni, who is jealous of Vani and Rani's close relationship despite Vani's refusal to ever directly address Rani, further worsens the problems, by conspiring against them and trying to separate them. Meanwhile, Selvi falls in love and under dire circumstances, marries Rajesh (Guhan Shanmugam) with only Vani as a chance witness, causing a rift in the family, and their eventual separation, resulting in Vani and Rani to get separated. However, Bhoominathan later realises his faults, turns over a new leaf and sends his mother away and tries to get the family together.\n\n===Episode 434-1200===\nThey get together but live in separate houses. However, problems continue to haunt them in the form of a vengeful Angayarkanni and Jyothi and Kadhir, a local don who has his vengeance against Saravanan. Gautham threatens Kadhir to leave his family alone. After many incidentes and obstacles Gautham marries Pooja to rescue Saravanan from Kadhir. Kadhir turns into a good man after Pooja's marriage. While Jyothi's daughter Poongodi (Mahalakshmi) is involved in a love triangle between Karthi (Rajkumar), and Saravanan. Selvi also faces numerous problems through her father in law, Kaali (Baboos), Alamelu and Shenbagam (Sumangali and Shreedevi), Shiva (Jai Ram) and Geetha, and later on through Kaali's daughter, Malathy (Minnal Deepa). Surya gets married to Dimple. She hates Vani and does everything against her mother-in-law. Surya and also Dimple wanted to divorce each other several times, but at the end, Vani was able to bring back them together. Gautham becomes a police man and investigates a murder that took place in a quarry which was owned by a doctor known as GP (Tarun Master). GP is also a big business magnate who controls the Indian medicine mafia activity and his son Arya (Fawaz Zayani) was a big criminal dealing in international illegal organ mafia activities. Then due to rage of Gautham killing Arya, GP vows to destroy Vaani's family and that will lead Pooja's uncle Kathir to revenge GP by mysteriously killing GP's henchmen and trying to destroy his businesses and his criminal network. GP tried killing Kathir but finally got arrested by Gautham. Saravanan gets married with Pavithra (Shruthi Shanmuga Priya).\n\n=== Episode 1200 - 1743 ===\n\nRivalry started between Vani and Akilandeswari ([[Mamilla Shailaja Priya]]) because of Surya's relationship with her daughter Janani (Priya) during college days. They had a daughter named Riya. Janani was murdered by Sudhakar, Akilandeswari's brother but he made Vani as the victim. So, Akilandeswari wanted to take revenge against Vani and Rani family. Meanwhile in Australia, Swaminathan had a relationship with kokila who actually died. Her jealous aunt Krishnaveni ([[Nalini (actress)|Nalini]]) wanted to amuse his wealth which was given by kokila's dad, with the help of Jessy who looks like kokila. Rani saved the wealth. After a  sequence of events, Thenu fell down from a hill top and lost her memories. She rescued by Chandrika ([[Madhuvanti Arun]]) and her brother. Chandrika treats her like own daughter Bhavani who died by jumping from the hill and she never wanted to give back Thenu to Rani. Akilandeswari helped her and started blackmailing Rani and forced her smuggle drugs but finally with the help of Rani and Vani, Thenu regained her memory. Then Akilandeswari and Sudhakar started a new plan with the help of Neela and Sanjay. Neela blackmails Saravanan and Surya in one way to take money from them and Sanjay takes Bhomminathan's company with the help of Sudhakar and creates a confusion between Swaminathan and Bhoominathan. Meanwhile Angayarkanni was murdered by Sanjay and made Swaminathan as the victim. Bhoominathan and Jyothi believed that Swami is the person who murdered their mother and a fight occurs between Bhoominathan and Swaminathan. After some turns of events, Sanjay plans to murder Swaminathan and Rani. At that time the evidence that Sanjay was the murder of Angayarkanni which was kept in a doll is taken away by Riya and finally the evidence reaches Swaminathan and Rani. Both of them blackmail Sanjay by telling him that they have given poison and Swaminathan brings back Bhoominathan's company to him and it is proved that Sanjay is the actual murderer. Hence, Bhoominathan and Swaminathan reunite with each other. But Akhilandeshwari tries to kill Vaani by an lorry accident. Raani comes to know about this plan and she goes in disguise of Vaani. Lorry hits Rani and she is admitted in hospital. At the climax Akiladeshwari came to know about Sudhakar being the murderer of Janani with the help of Gautham. Here ,after hearing the situation of Raani, Vani faints. After some emotional affection between the sisters, their health gets improved. Akilandeshwari gets arrested by Gautham before that she apologizes for her every mistakes to both Vani and Rani. Then the family lived happily thereafter.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{cleanup|section|date=November 2019|reason=Section is not consistent with [[WP:TVCAST]].

Her consort is [[Shiva]] as [[Shiva|Triyambak]] ([[Shiva|Bhuvaneswara]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word Bhuvane\u015bwari is a [[sanskrit compounds|compound]] of the words ''Bhuvana I\u015bwari'', meaning \"Goddess of the world\" or \"Queen of the universe\", where the worlds are the ''tri-bhuvana'' or three regions of ''bh\u016b\u1e25'' ([[Earth]]), ''bhuva\u1e25'' ([[atmosphere]]) and ''sva\u1e25'' (Heavens).\n\n==Legends==\n{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2018}}\nDuring the beginning of time the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s \u2013 [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Rudra]] did not know who they were and what was their purpose. At this time a flying chariot appeared before them, and a heavenly voice directed them to board the chariot. As the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s boarded the chariot and it started flowing with mind's speed and took them to a mysterious place, which was an island of gems surrounded by ocean of nectar and pristine [[wikt:sylvan|sylvan]] forests. As they stepped out of the chariot, the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s were transformed into women, much to their astonishment. As they explored the island they came across an Imperial city protected by nine enclosures and guarded by fierce [[Bhairava]]s, [[Matrikas]], [[Kshetrapala]]s and [[Guardians of the directions|Dikpalas]]. As they entered the city they were amazed by its prosperity and soaring infrastructure and finally reached the Imperial Palace known as '''Chintamanigriha''', guarded by [[Yogini]]s. For this was \u015ar\u012bp\u016bra (alias Devipattana), the capital of Devi Bhuvaneshvari, the Empress of [[Manidvipa]], the abode of [[Adi Parashakti]]. When they entered the palace they witnessed Devi Bhuvaneshvari, the queen of all worlds.\n\nHer complexion was red. She had three eyes, four arms, braided hair and was clad in red ornaments. She wore a garland of lotuses and Her body was anointed with red sandalwood paste. She held a goad and a noose with Her left hands, while her right hands displayed abhaya and varada [[mudras]]. She was decked with ornaments and wore a crown with a digit of crescent moon as crest jewel.\n\nShe was seated on the left lap of [[Shiva|Trayambaka Bhairava]], who was of white complexion, wore white garments and was decked with ornaments. His hair was matted and was decorated by a crescent moon and Ganga. He had five faces each with three-eyes, and four arms, holding a trident and a battle-axe while displaying varada and abhaya [[mudras]].\n\nThe Divine Couple was seated on '''Panchapretasana''', a throne which had [[Paramashiva]] as plank while [[Sadashiva]], [[Ishvara]], [[Rudra]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]] were five legs. They were being served by many [[Yogini]]s, some fanning them, some holding mirror, some offering [[betel]] leaves flavoured with [[camphor]], some offering a drink made by mixing honey, [[ghee]], wine and coconut water. Some were ready to dress Bhuvaneshvari's hair, some ready to do makeup, some busy stringing garlands while some singing and dancing to entertain Devi.\n\nThe [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s witnessed millions of universes each with their own [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s, in the sheen of Bhuvaneshvari's toe-nail. Some were getting created by [[Brahma]], some getting sustained by [[Vishnu]] while others getting annihilated by [[Rudra]].\n\nBhuvaneshvari enlightened the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s with Her greatness. Trayambaka is [[Brahman]] while Bhuvaneshvari is [[Shakti|Brahmashakti]]. Though they appear distinct, both are of the nature of one another. Trayambaka is [[Purusha|Adipurusha]] while Bhuvaneshvari is [[Prakriti|Mulaprakriti]]. To help Trayambaka perform his three-fold Lila, Bhuvaneshvari has created three forms of him- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Rudra]]. Thus, [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s are forms of Trayambaka. Thereafter Bhuvaneshvari gave her shaktis [[Saraswati]] to [[Brahma]], [[Lakshmi]] to [[Vishnu]] and [[Kali]] to [[Rudra]] and departed them to their respective places.\n\n[[Brahma]] with [[Saraswati]] created an cosmic egg and [[Rudra]] with [[Parvati|Uma]] split it, exposing the [[Pancha Bhoota]]s. [[Brahma]] with [[Saraswati]] fashioned the universe from [[Pancha Bhoota]]s, and [[Vishnu]] and [[Lakshmi]] sustain it. At the end [[Rudra]] with [[Kali]] will annihilate the universe so that [[Brahma]] and [[Saraswati]] can start afresh.\n\nOnce, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva were involved in an argument about who is the most powerful and supreme of the three. Their debate became so intense that it disturbed the peace of the heavens and worried the Gods. That was when the beautiful Goddess stepped in to intervene and cease the dispute. She took the Trinity of Gods to her idyllic abode and led them to her beautiful chamber. There, Goddess Bhuvaneshwari enlightens them that she is the creator of the entire universe as it is created out of her and ends in her. She is responsible for protecting it from devils. She has created many elements and gave life to all the Gods, sages and all living beings.<br>\n<br>\nShe had also created many worlds, such as Satyalok, where Lord Brahma lives. It is the most supreme place of all the worlds where the inhabitants are free of life and death cycle. Then Taplok came into being, where the soul, including the body, resides. The inhabitants there wait for Satyalok to take shape. Gyanlok then was formed where the place had the presence of ascetics who were the inhabitants. Maharlok came into being where after the harsh penances, the sages and ascetics have a place to live. The sages who live in that place has the power equal to Gods. That is why all the sages live in that place. Then comes Anandlok, which is Swarglok, which is the residence of Gods and virtuous beings. Next, Bhuvarlok was formed where the sun and planets are positioned. After Bhuvarlok came Bhulok, where mortal and other living beings live.<br>\n<br>\nThe worlds beneath Earth came into being, the first being Atal Lok in which it is the home of revelry and all the wealth of the planets in accumulated there. Then came Vital Lok, where the beings of the earth stay there to mine gold and other elements. Just like Atal Lok, Vital Lok is centred on earthly riches. Then through King Bali, the king of demons, Sutal Lok came into being. Talatal Lok came into existence and below that, Mahatal was created in which it is Naaglok, the home of all serpents and snake girls. Further down below is the realm of demons and monsters, named Rasatal. Finally, below all the worlds, then originated Patal Lok where Vasuki, the King of snakes lives. This is the foundation of all the other realms.<br>\n<br>\nThen, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev witnessed millions of universes each with their own person, in the sheen of Bhuvaneshwari&apos;s toe-nail. Some were getting created by Brahma, some getting sustained by Vishnu while others getting annihilated by Rudra. Bhuvaneshwari enlightened the Tridevas with Her greatness.<br>\n<br>\nThereafter, Goddess Bhuvaneshwari gave her Shaktis Saraswati to Brahma, Lakshmi to Vishnu, and Gauri to Shiva. She informed Tridev that her Shaktis that they are given to will help them create and preserve the world, and when the appropriate time comes, it will be destroyed completely so that a new creation can be started afresh by Brahma and Saraswati.\n\n==Temples==\n[[File:Bhuvaneshvari.jpg|thumb|Bhuvaneshvari.

Her consort is [[Shiva]] as [[Shiva|Triyambak]] ([[Shiva|Bhuvaneswara]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word Bhuvane\u015bwari is a [[sanskrit compounds|compound]] of the words ''Bhuvana I\u015bwari'', meaning \"Goddess of the world\" or \"Queen of the universe\", where the worlds are the ''tri-bhuvana'' or three regions of ''bh\u016b\u1e25'' ([[Earth]]), ''bhuva\u1e25'' ([[atmosphere]]) and ''sva\u1e25'' (Heavens).\n\n==Legends==\n{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2018}}\nDuring the beginning of time the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s \u2013 [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Rudra]] did not know who they were and what was their purpose. At this time a flying chariot appeared before them, and a heavenly voice directed them to board the chariot. As the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s boarded the chariot and it started flowing with mind's speed and took them to a mysterious place, which was an island of gems surrounded by ocean of nectar and pristine [[wikt:sylvan|sylvan]] forests. As they stepped out of the chariot, the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s were transformed into women, much to their astonishment. As they explored the island they came across an Imperial city protected by nine enclosures and guarded by fierce [[Bhairava]]s, [[Matrikas]], [[Kshetrapala]]s and [[Guardians of the directions|Dikpalas]]. As they entered the city they were amazed by its prosperity and soaring infrastructure and finally reached the Imperial Palace known as '''Chintamanigriha''', guarded by [[Yogini]]s. For this was \u015ar\u012bp\u016bra (alias Devipattana), the capital of Devi Bhuvaneshvari, the Empress of [[Manidvipa]], the abode of [[Adi Parashakti]]. When they entered the palace they witnessed Devi Bhuvaneshvari, the queen of all worlds.\n\nHer complexion was red. She had three eyes, four arms, braided hair and was clad in red ornaments. She wore a garland of lotuses and Her body was anointed with red sandalwood paste. She held a goad and a noose with Her left hands, while her right hands displayed abhaya and varada [[mudras]]. She was decked with ornaments and wore a crown with a digit of crescent moon as crest jewel.\n\nShe was seated on the left lap of [[Shiva|Trayambaka Bhairava]], who was of white complexion, wore white garments and was decked with ornaments. His hair was matted and was decorated by a crescent moon and Ganga. He had five faces each with three-eyes, and four arms, holding a trident and a battle-axe while displaying varada and abhaya [[mudras]].\n\nThe Divine Couple was seated on '''Panchapretasana''', a throne which had [[Paramashiva]] as plank while [[Sadashiva]], [[Ishvara]], [[Rudra]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]] were five legs. They were being served by many [[Yogini]]s, some fanning them, some holding mirror, some offering [[betel]] leaves flavoured with [[camphor]], some offering a drink made by mixing honey, [[ghee]], wine and coconut water. Some were ready to dress Bhuvaneshvari's hair, some ready to do makeup, some busy stringing garlands while some singing and dancing to entertain Devi.\n\nThe [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s witnessed millions of universes each with their own [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s, in the sheen of Bhuvaneshvari's toe-nail. Some were getting created by [[Brahma]], some getting sustained by [[Vishnu]] while others getting annihilated by [[Rudra]].\n\nBhuvaneshvari enlightened the [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s with Her greatness. Trayambaka is [[Brahman]] while Bhuvaneshvari is [[Shakti|Brahmashakti]]. Though they appear distinct, both are of the nature of one another. Trayambaka is [[Purusha|Adipurusha]] while Bhuvaneshvari is [[Prakriti|Mulaprakriti]]. To help Trayambaka perform his three-fold Lila, Bhuvaneshvari has created three forms of him- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Rudra]]. Thus, [[Trimurti|Trideva]]s are forms of Trayambaka. Thereafter Bhuvaneshvari gave her shaktis [[Saraswati]] to [[Brahma]], [[Lakshmi]] to [[Vishnu]] and [[Kali]] to [[Rudra]] and departed them to their respective places.\n\n[[Brahma]] with [[Saraswati]] created an cosmic egg and [[Rudra]] with [[Parvati|Uma]] split it, exposing the [[Pancha Bhoota]]s. [[Brahma]] with [[Saraswati]] fashioned the universe from [[Pancha Bhoota]]s, and [[Vishnu]] and [[Lakshmi]] sustain it. At the end [[Rudra]] with [[Kali]] will annihilate the universe so that [[Brahma]] and [[Saraswati]] can start afresh.\n\nOnce, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva were involved in an argument about who is the most powerful and supreme of the three. Their debate became so intense that it disturbed the peace of the heavens and worried the Gods. That was when the beautiful Goddess stepped in to intervene and cease the dispute. She took the Trinity of Gods to her idyllic abode and led them to her beautiful chamber. There, Goddess Bhuvaneshwari enlightens them that she is the creator of the entire universe as it is created out of her and ends in her. She is responsible for protecting it from devils. She has created many elements and gave life to all the Gods, sages and all living beings.<br>\n<br>\nShe had also created many worlds, such as Satyalok, where Lord Brahma lives. It is the most supreme place of all the worlds where the inhabitants are free of life and death cycle. Then Taplok came into being, where the soul, including the body, resides. The inhabitants there wait for Satyalok to take shape. Gyanlok then was formed where the place had the presence of ascetics who were the inhabitants. Maharlok came into being where after the harsh penances, the sages and ascetics have a place to live. The sages who live in that place has the power equal to Gods. That is why all the sages live in that place. Then comes Anandlok, which is Swarglok, which is the residence of Gods and virtuous beings. Next, Bhuvarlok was formed where the sun and planets are positioned. After Bhuvarlok came Bhulok, where mortal and other living beings live.<br>\n<br>\nThe worlds beneath Earth came into being, the first being Atal Lok in which it is the home of revelry and all the wealth of the planets in accumulated there. Then came Vital Lok, where the beings of the earth stay there to mine gold and other elements. Just like Atal Lok, Vital Lok is centred on earthly riches. Then through King Bali, the king of demons, Sutal Lok came into being. Talatal Lok came into existence and below that, Mahatal was created in which it is Naaglok, the home of all serpents and snake girls. Further down below is the realm of demons and monsters, named Rasatal. Finally, below all the worlds, then originated Patal Lok where Vasuki, the King of snakes lives. This is the foundation of all the other realms.<br>\n<br>\nThen, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev witnessed millions of universes each with their own person, in the sheen of Bhuvaneshwari&apos;s toe-nail. Some were getting created by Brahma, some getting sustained by Vishnu while others getting annihilated by Rudra. Bhuvaneshwari enlightened the Tridevas with Her greatness.<br>\n<br>\nThereafter, Goddess Bhuvaneshwari gave her Shaktis Saraswati to Brahma, Lakshmi to Vishnu, and Gauri to Shiva. She informed Tridev that her Shaktis that they are given to will help them create and preserve the world, and when the appropriate time comes, it will be destroyed completely so that a new creation can be started afresh by Brahma and Saraswati.\n\n==Temples==\n[[File:Bhuvaneshvari.jpg|thumb|Bhuvaneshvari.
