{"title_page": "Zone of proximal development", "text_new": "[[File:Zone of proximal development.svg|thumb|In the second circle, representing the zone of proximal development, students cannot complete tasks unaided, but can complete them with guidance.]]\nThe '''zone of proximal development''', often abbreviated as '''ZPD''' (''zona blizhaishego razvitiia'', in original Russian), is best understood as the zone of the closest, most immediate [[psychological development]] of the children that includes a wide range of their emotional, cognitive, and volitional psychological processes. In contemporary [[educational research]] and practice, though, it is often interpreted as the distance between what a learner can do without help, and what they can do with support from someone with more knowledge or expertise (\"more knowledgeable other\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zone of proximal development. (2009). In ''Penguin dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database</ref> The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896&ndash;1934) during the last three years of his life.<ref name=\"bioBook\">Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography]. London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]</ref> Vygotsky argued that a child gets involved in a dialogue with the \"more knowledgeable other\" such as a peer or an adult and gradually, through social interaction and sense-making, develops the ability to solve problems independently and do certain tasks without help. Following Vygotsky, some educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.<ref>Berk, L & Winsler, A. (1995).  Vygotsky also felt that social interaction was very important when it came to learning. \"Vygotsky: His life and works\" and \"Vygotsky's approach to development\".

Of Young Children. p. 24</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934.jpg|thumb|Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934]]\n\nThe concept of the zone of proximal development was originally developed by Vygotsky to argue against the use of academic, knowledge-based tests as a means to gauge students' [[intelligence]]. He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone and autonomous learners.<ref name=\"Scaffolding\">''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database</ref> Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that math and writing did not come as naturally. Essentially, he concluded that because these concepts were taught in school settings with unnecessary assessments, they were of more difficulty to learners.Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.<ref name=\"Theories\">Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others.  They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. The term more knowledgeable others (MKO) is used to describe someone who has a better understanding or higher ability level than the learner, in reference to the specific task, idea, or concept.<ref>McLeod, S. A. (2018, Aug 05). Lev Vygotsky. Retrieved from https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html.</ref>  He noted cultural experiences where children are greatly helped by knowledge and tools handed down from previous generations. Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and \"pull the students along.\"<ref name=\"Theories\" />\n\nVygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help.<ref>Berk, L & Winsler, A. (1995).  \"Vygotsky: His life and works\" and \"Vygotsky's approach to development\".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. of Young Children. pp. 25&ndash;34</ref> He proposed a question: \"if two children perform the same on a test, are their levels of development the same?\" He concluded that they were not.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Stages of development.

The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer.

In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher's job is to move the child's mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can't teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can't teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons.<ref name=\"Theories\" /> An example is the often-used [[Accelerated Reader|accelerated reading]] program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of [[standardized test]]s is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.<ref name=\"Theories\" />\n\nIn the context of [[Second-language acquisition|second language learning]], the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky's definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context.<ref>Fani, Tayebeh & Ghaemi, Farid.

The ZPD concept is seen as a [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], a structure of \"support points\" for performing an action.<ref>Obukhova, L. F., & Korepanova, I. A. (2009).

Retrieved October 13, 2014.</ref> Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by [[Jerome Bruner]], David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts.<ref name=\"Scaffolding\"/> According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.<ref name=\"Wass\">Wass, R., & Golding, C. (2014). Sharpening a tool for teaching: the zone of proximal development. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 19(6), 671-684.</ref>\n\nScaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary\u2014much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. \"Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions.\"<ref>Balaban, Nancy. (1995). \"Seeing the Child, Knowing the Person.\" In Ayers, W. ''To Become a Teacher''. Teachers College Press. p. 52</ref> This concept has been further developed by [[Mercedes Chaves Jaime]], [[Ann Brown]], among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including [[reciprocal teaching]] and [[dynamic assessment]]. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there.<ref name=\"Morgan, A. 2009\"/>\n\nOne example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their [[speech]] develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it.<ref name=\"Wells 1999\">Wells, G. (1999). ''Dialogic Inquiries in education: Building on the legacy of Vygotsky''. Cambridge University Press. p. 57</ref>\n\nIn mathematics, proximal development uses [[mathematical exercise]]s for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.\n\nAnother example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and [[driving]] instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.\n\nThe concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill.\n\n== Implications for educators ==\n[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|More knowledgeable others, like teachers, parents, and peers helped the learner to understand things that they cannot acquire by their own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Educational psychology : windows on classrooms|last=Eggen, Paul D.|others=Kauchak, Donald P., 1946-|year=2016|isbn=9780133549485|edition=Tenth|location=Boston|pages=|oclc=889941365}}</ref>{{Rp|80}}]]\nVarious investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.<ref>Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., & Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.</ref> Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.<ref name=\"Wass\" /> Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development.<ref>McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development.

One of the largest hurdles to overcome when providing ample support for student learning is managing multiple students. While scaffolding is meant to be a relatively independent process for students, the initial phase of providing individual guidance can easily be overseen when managing large classrooms. Thus, time becomes a critical factor in a scaffolding lesson plan. In order to accommodate more learners, teachers are often faced with cutting parts of lessons or dedicating less time to each student.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gabriel Peters |url=https://www.theclassroom.com/advantages-disadvantages-scaffolding-classroom-8008434.html |title=Advantages & Disadvantages of Scaffolding in |publisher=The Classroom |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> In turn, this hastened class time might result in loss of interest in students or even invalid peer-teaching. Cognitive abilities of the student also play a significant role in the success of scaffolding. Ideally, students are able to learn within this zone of proximal development, but this is often not the case. Recognizing students' individual abilities and foundation knowledge can be a challenge of successful scaffolding. If a student is evidently less prepared for this learning approach and begins to compare themselves to their peers, their self-efficacy and motivation to learn can be hindered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scaffoldingliteracy.weebly.com/benefits-and-challenges-of-scaffolding.html|title=Benefits and Challenges of Scaffolding|website=Scaffolding Literacy}}</ref> These hurdles of scaffolding and the zone of proximal development are important to acknowledge so that teachers can find solutions to the problems or alter their teaching methods.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constructivism (learning theory)]]\n* [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)]]\n* [[Curse of knowledge]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Social constructivism (learning theory)]]\n* [[Sociocultural theory]]\n* [[Four stages of competence]]\n* [[Shuhari]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=zone of proximal development}}\n*Chaiklin, S.

Following Vygotsky, some educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.<ref>Berk, L & Winsler, A. (1995).  Vygotsky also felt that social interaction was very important when it came to learning. \"Vygotsky: His life and works\" and \"Vygotsky's approach to development\".

He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone and autonomous learners.<ref name=\"Scaffolding\">''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database</ref> Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that math and writing did not come as naturally. Essentially, he concluded that because these concepts were taught in school settings with unnecessary assessments, they were of more difficulty to learners.Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.<ref name=\"Theories\">Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others.  They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. The term more knowledgeable others (MKO) is used to describe someone who has a better understanding or higher ability level than the learner, in reference to the specific task, idea, or concept.<ref>McLeod, S. A. (2018, Aug 05). Lev Vygotsky.

It was released digitally on 8 May 2016, with CD and vinyl releases in June 2016 through [[XL Recordings]].\n\nRadiohead recorded ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' in southern France with longtime producer [[Nigel Godrich]]. It features [[String section|strings]] and [[Choir|choral vocals]] arranged by guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] and performed by the [[London Contemporary Orchestra]]. Several songs, such as \"[[True Love Waits (song)|True Love Waits]]\" and \"[[Burn the Witch (Radiohead song)|Burn the Witch]]\", were written years earlier. The lyrics address [[climate change]], [[groupthink]], and heartbreak; many critics saw them as a response to singer [[Thom Yorke]]'s split from his partner [[Rachel Owen]]. The artwork was created by Yorke with longtime collaborator [[Stanley Donwood]], who created abstract works by exposing his paintings to weather.\n\nRadiohead promoted ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' with singles and videos for \"Burn the Witch\" and \"[[Daydreaming (Radiohead song)|Daydreaming]]\", a [[Viral marketing|viral campaign]] of social media and postcards, and a series of video vignettes. A world tour began in May 2016, with legs in 2017 and 2018 and headline performances at festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]]. The tour included a controversial performance in Tel Aviv, disregarding the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign for an international cultural [[Boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israel]].\n\n''A Moon Shaped Pool'' appeared in many publications' lists of the year's best albums. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]], and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] (for \"Burn the Witch\") at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It topped the charts in several countries, becoming Radiohead's sixth number-one album in the UK, and was a bestseller on vinyl. It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in the UK and US in 2018.\n\n==Background==\nSeveral tracks on ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' were written years before the recording. \"[[True Love Waits (song)|True Love Waits]]\" dates to at least 1995, and Radiohead performed it numerous times over the following years, becoming one of their best-known unreleased songs.<ref>{{cite

affecting ... [''A Moon Shaped Pool'' is] one of their most musically and emotionally arresting albums.\"<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Review\"/>\n\nSam Richards of ''[[NME]]'' described ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' as \"an album of eerie, elusive beauty that is strange, shimmering and uncertain all at the same time\".<ref name=\"NME review\"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for [[AllMusic]] that \"there's a melancholic comfort to its ebb and flow, a gentle rocking motion that feels comforting; it's a tonic to the cloistered, scattered ''King of Limbs'' and even the sleek alienation of ''Kid A''\".<ref name=\"AllMusic review\" /> ''Pitchfork'' editor Jayson Greene felt the album was coloured by Yorke's separation: \"The impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy.\"<ref name=\"ew\" /> At the end of the year, ''Pitchfork'' named \"Daydreaming\" and \"True Love Waits\" among the best songs of 2016.<ref name=\"100 Best\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9981-the-100-best-songs-of-2016/|title=The 100 Best Songs of 2016|date=12 December 2016|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213113902/http://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9981-the-100-best-songs-of-2016/|archivedate=13 December 2016|url-status=live|access-date=12 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nEric Renner Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the variety and scale: \"By nature, Radiohead albums will always be somewhat epic, but this one is more consistently grandiose than any of the band's releases since 2000's masterpiece ''Kid A''.\"<ref name=\"ew\" /> [[Jon Pareles]], writing for the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', wrote that ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' was perhaps \"[Radiohead's] darkest statement \u2013 though the one with the band's most pastoral surface\".<ref name=\"NY Times review\" /> He praised Yorke's vocals and Greenwood's string arrangements, writing: \"Both Mr. Yorke and Mr. Greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners, lovers of melody and explorers of idioms, makers of puzzles who don't shy away from emotion.\"<ref name=\"NY Times review\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/arts/music/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review.html|title=In Radiohead's 'A Moon Shaped Pool', Patient Perfectionism|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 May 2016|accessdate=8 May 2016|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512202652/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/arts/music/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review.html|archivedate=12 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Chris Barton of the ''[[The Los Angeles Times|Los Angeles Times]]'' described ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' as \"a rich and engrossing listen that somehow finds more undiscovered territory for a band that has built a career on doing just that\".<ref name=\"LA Times review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-radiohead-review-20160506-snap-story.html|title=Radiohead Looks to the Organic on the Engrossing 'A Moon Shaped Pool'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=8 May 2016|accessdate=9 May 2016|last=Barton|first=Chris|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509022634/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-radiohead-review-20160506-snap-story.html|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[MTV]]'s Simon Vozick-Levinson wrote: \"''A Moon Shaped Pool'' provides a thrilling answer to the existential concerns that confront any band that's made it this far ...

It was released digitally on 8 May 2016, with CD and vinyl releases in June 2016 through [[XL Recordings]].\n\nRadiohead recorded ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' in southern France with longtime producer [[Nigel Godrich]]. It features [[String section|strings]] and [[Choir|choral vocals]] arranged by guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] and performed by the [[London Contemporary Orchestra]]. Several songs, such as \"[[True Love Waits (song)|True Love Waits]]\" and \"[[Burn the Witch (Radiohead song)|Burn the Witch]]\", were written years earlier. The lyrics address [[climate change]], [[groupthink]], and heartbreak; many critics saw them as a response to singer [[Thom Yorke]]'s split from his partner [[Rachel Owen]]. The artwork was created by Yorke with longtime collaborator [[Stanley Donwood]], who created abstract works by exposing his paintings to weather.\n\nRadiohead promoted ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' with singles and videos for \"Burn the Witch\" and \"[[Daydreaming (Radiohead song)|Daydreaming]]\", a [[Viral marketing|viral campaign]] of social media and postcards, and a series of video vignettes. A world tour began in May 2016, with legs in 2017 and 2018 and headline performances at festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]]. The tour included a controversial performance in Tel Aviv, disregarding the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign for an international cultural [[Boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israel]].\n\n''A Moon Shaped Pool'' appeared in many publications' lists of the year's best albums. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]], and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] (for \"Burn the Witch\") at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It topped the charts in several countries, becoming Radiohead's sixth number-one album in the UK, and was a bestseller on vinyl. It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in the UK and US in 2018.\n\n==Background==\nSeveral tracks on ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' were written years before the recording. \"[[True

[''A Moon Shaped Pool'' is] one of their most musically and emotionally arresting albums.\"<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Review\"/>\n\nSam Richards of ''[[NME]]'' described ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' as \"an album of eerie, elusive beauty that is strange, shimmering and uncertain all at the same time\".<ref name=\"NME review\"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for [[AllMusic]] that \"there's a melancholic comfort to its ebb and flow, a gentle rocking motion that feels comforting; it's a tonic to the cloistered, scattered ''King of Limbs'' and even the sleek alienation of ''Kid A''\".<ref name=\"AllMusic review\" /> ''Pitchfork'' editor Jayson Greene felt the album was coloured by Yorke's separation: \"The impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable.
