There are also mountains in the western portion. The country is located on the east coast of southern Africa, directly west of the island of [[Madagascar]]. Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons, a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September.\n\n==Physical features==\n===The Coast===\nThe coastline extends from 26\u00b0 52\u2032 S. to 10\u00b0 40\u2032 S., and from south to north makes a double curve with a general trend outward to the east. It has a length of {{convert|1430|mi|km}}. \n\nThe southern coastline is characterized by sandy beaches backed by coastal dunes. The dunes can reach up to 120 meters in height, and older dunes are vegetated. Behind the coastal dunes are lagoons, including river estuaries, closed saline lagoons, and salt lakes.<ref>Pereira, Marcos & Litulo, Carlos & Santos, Rodrigo & Costa Leal, Miguel & Fernandes, Raquel & Tibirica, Yara & Williams, Jess & Atanassov, Boris & Carreira, Filipa & Massingue, Alice & Marques da Silva, Isabel. (2014). Mozambique marine ecosystems review. 10.13140/2.1.2092.5766.</ref> Some {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} north of the [[South Africa]]n frontier is the deep indentation of [[Maputo Bay]] (formerly Delagoa Bay). The land then turns outward to [[Cape Correntes]], a little north of which is [[Inhambane Bay]]. Bending westward again and passing the [[Bazaruto Archipelago]] of several small islands, of which the chief is [[Bazaruto Island|Bazaruto]].\n\nMozambique's central coast, from Bazaruto Island north to [[Angoche Island]], is known as the [[Bight of Sofala/Swamp Coast|Bight of Sofala]] or Sofala Bay. It is also known as the Swamp Coast, and is  characterized by extensive mangrove swamps and coastal wetlands. As in the south, the coastline is generally low, and harbours are few and poor.\n\nThe bay has an area of {{convert|801,590|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The continental shelf is up to 140 km wide at [[Beira]], and is Mozambique's most important marine fishery. Several large rivers, including the [[Save River (Africa)|Save]], [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]], and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]], create costal estuaries and [[river delta]]s, of which the Zambezi delta is the largest.<ref>Pereira, Marcos & Litulo, Carlos & Santos, Rodrigo & Costa Leal, Miguel & Fernandes, Raquel & Tibirica, Yara & Williams, Jess & Atanassov, Boris & Carreira, Filipa & Massingue, Alice & Marques da Silva, Isabel. (2014). Mozambique marine ecosystems review. 10.13140/2.1.2092.5766.</ref> North of the Zambezi delta the coast is studded with small islands, mainly of coral formation.\n\nThe northern coast is much indented, abounding in rocky headlands and rugged cliffs, with an almost continuous fringe of islands. On one of these islands is [[Island of Mozambique|Mozambique]], and immediately north of that port is [[Conducia Bay]]. Somewhat farther north are two large bays, [[Fernao Veloso Bay]] and [[Memba Bay]]. North of Fernao Veloso and Memba the largest bays are Pemba (where there is commodious anchorage for heavy draught vessels), Montepuesi and Tunghi, the last named having for its northern arm [[Cape Delgado]], the northernmost point on Mozambique's coast. Cape Delgado is part of the delta of the [[Ruvuma River]], which forms Mozambique's border with [[Tanzania]].\n\nThe northern coast is part of the [[East African coral coast]], a marine ecoregion that extends along the coasts of northern Mozambique, Tanzania, and Kenya.<ref>Spalding, Mark D., Helen E. Fox, Gerald R. Allen, Nick Davidson ''et al.'' \"Marine Ecoregions of the World: A Bioregionalization of Coastal and Shelf Areas\". ''Bioscience'' Vol. 57 No. 7, July/August 2007, pp. 573-583.</ref> Along the northern coast the [[Mozambique Current]], which flows south between [[Madagascar]] and the mainland, is close to the coast and scours out all the softer material, while at the same time the [[coral]]s are building in deep waters.\n\n===Orography===\nOrographically the backbone of the country is the mountain chain which forms the eastern escarpment of the continental plateau. It does not present a uniformly abrupt descent to the plains, but in places, as in the lower Zambezi district, slopes gradually to the coast. The [[Lebombo Mountains]], behind Delagoa Bay, nowhere exceed {{convert|2070|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in height. The [[Manica Plateau]], farther north between the Save and Zambezi rivers, is higher, rising towards the [[Eastern Highlands]] along the border with [[Zimbabwe]]. [[Monte Binga]] ({{convert|2440|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), on the border with Zimbabwe, is Mozambique's highest peak. [[Mount Gorongosa]] ({{convert|6550|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) lies north-east of the Manica Plateau, and is, like it, of granitic formation. Gorongosa, rising isolated with precipitous outer slopes, has been likened in its aspect to a frowning citadel. East of Gorongosa a [[graben]] valley extends from the Zambezi to Pungwe Bay, the southern extension of the [[African Rift Valley]]. The [[Cheringoma Plateau]] lies east of the graben, sloping gently towards the coast.\n\nThe chief mountain range lies north of the Zambezi, and east of [[Lake Chilwa]], namely, the [[Namuli Mountains]], in which Namuli Peak rises to {{convert|8860|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and Molisani, Mruli and Mresi attain altitudes of {{convert|6500|to|8000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} These mountains are covered with magnificent forests. Farther north the river basins are divided by well-marked ranges with heights of {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and over. Near the south-east shore of [[Lake Malawi]] there is a high range ({{convert|5000|to|6000|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} with an abrupt descent to the lake - some {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in {{convert|6|mi|km|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The country between Malawi and Ibo is remarkable for the number of fantastically-shaped granite peaks, or [[inselberg]]s, which rise from the plateau. \n\nThe plateau lands west of the escarpment are of moderate elevation - perhaps averaging {{convert|2000|to|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} It is, however, only along the Zambezi and north of that river that Mozambique's territory reaches to the continental plateau. This northern plain has been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as part of the [[Eastern Miombo woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].\n\n===Rivers===\nBesides the Zambezi, the most considerable river in Mozambique is the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] which enters the [[Indian Ocean]] about {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} north of Maputo Bay. The [[Komati River|Komati]], Save, Busi and [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]] south of the Zambezi; the Lukugu, [[L\u00fario River|Lurio]], Montepuesi (Mtepwesi) and Msalu, with the [[Ruvuma River|Ruvuma]] (or Rovuma) and its affluent the [[Lugenda River|Lugenda]] (or Lujenda), to the north of it, are the other Mozambican rivers with considerable drainage areas. The [[Save River (Africa)|Save]] (Sabi) rises in [[Zimbabwe]] at an altitude of over {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and after flowing south for over {{convert|200|mi|km|0}} turns east and pierces the mountains some {{convert|170|mi|km|0}} from the coast, being joined near the Zimbabwe-Mozambique frontier by the Lundi. Cataracts entirely prevent navigation above this point.\n\nBelow the Lundi confluence the bed of the Save becomes considerably broader, varying from half a mile to two miles (3&nbsp;km). In the rainy season the Save is a large stream and even in the \"dries\" it can be navigated from its mouth by shallow draught steamers for over 150 miles. Its general direction through Portuguese territory is east by north. At its mouth it forms a delta {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} in extent. The Busi (220 miles) and Pungwe (180 miles) are streams north of and similar in character to the Save. They both rise in the Manica Plateau and enter the ocean in [[Pungwe Bay]], their mouths a mile or two apart.\n\nThe lower reaches of both streams are navigable, the Busi for {{convert|25|mi|km|0}}, the Pungwe for about {{convert|2|mi|1}}. At the mouth of the Pungwe is the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]]. Of the north-Zambezi streams the [[Lukugu River|Lukugu]], rising in the hills south-east of Lake Chilwa, flows south and enters the ocean not far north of [[Quelimane]]. The L\u00fario, rising in the Namuli Mountains, flows north-east, having a course of some {{convert|200|mi|km|0}}. The Montepuesi and the Msalu drain the country between the Lurio and Ruvuma basins. Their banks are in general well defined and the wet season rise seems fairly constant.\n\n===Somali Plate===\nGeologists have divided the Phanerozoic era of Mozambique's geology into the Karoo and post-Karoo era. This terminology is mostly used pertaining to studies of the structural and stratigraphic composition of rocks in the Zambezi valley.<ref>Nairn, Alan EM, Ian Lerche, and James E. Iliffe. \"Geology, basin analysis, and hydrocarbon potential of Mozambique and the Mozambique Channel.\" Earth-Science Reviews 30.1-2 (1991): 81-123.</ref> Mozambique entirely lies within the [[Somali Plate]].<ref>Emerick, C. M., and R. A. Duncan. \"Age progressive volcanism in the Comores Archipelago, western Indian Ocean and implications for Somali plate tectonics.\" Earth and Planetary Science Letters 60.3 (1982): 415-428.</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Mozambique map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Mozambique map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification types]]\nMozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons, a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September. Climatic conditions vary depending on altitude. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south. \n\nAnnual precipitation varies from {{convert|500|to|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} depending on the region with an average of {{convert|590|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Cyclones are also common during the wet season.

There are also mountains in the western portion. The country is located on the east coast of southern Africa, directly west of the island of [[Madagascar]]. Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons, a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September.\n\n==Physical features==\n===The Coast===\nThe coastline extends from 26\u00b0 52\u2032 S. to 10\u00b0 40\u2032 S., and from south to north makes a double curve with a general trend outward to the east. It has a length of {{convert|1430|mi|km}}. \n\nThe southern coastline is characterized by sandy beaches backed by coastal dunes. The dunes can reach up to 120 meters in height, and older dunes are vegetated. Behind the coastal dunes are lagoons, including river estuaries, closed saline lagoons, and salt lakes.<ref>Pereira, Marcos & Litulo, Carlos & Santos, Rodrigo & Costa Leal, Miguel & Fernandes, Raquel & Tibirica, Yara & Williams, Jess & Atanassov, Boris & Carreira, Filipa & Massingue, Alice & Marques da Silva, Isabel. (2014). Mozambique marine ecosystems review. 10.13140/2.1.2092.5766.</ref> Some {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} north of the [[South Africa]]n frontier is the deep indentation of [[Maputo Bay]] (formerly Delagoa Bay). The land then turns outward to [[Cape Correntes]], a little north of which is [[Inhambane Bay]]. Bending westward again and passing the [[Bazaruto Archipelago]] of several small islands, of which the chief is [[Bazaruto Island|Bazaruto]].\n\nMozambique's central coast, from Bazaruto Island north to [[Angoche Island]], is known as the [[Bight of Sofala/Swamp Coast|Bight of Sofala]] or Sofala Bay. It is also known as the Swamp Coast, and is  characterized by extensive mangrove swamps and coastal wetlands. As in the south, the coastline is generally low, and harbours are few and poor.\n\nThe bay has an area of {{convert|801,590|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The continental shelf is up to 140 km wide at [[Beira]], and is Mozambique's most important marine fishery. Several large rivers, including the [[Save River (Africa)|Save]], [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]], and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]], create costal estuaries and [[river delta]]s, of which the Zambezi delta is the largest.<ref>Pereira, Marcos & Litulo, Carlos & Santos, Rodrigo & Costa Leal, Miguel & Fernandes, Raquel & Tibirica, Yara & Williams, Jess & Atanassov, Boris & Carreira, Filipa & Massingue, Alice & Marques da Silva, Isabel. (2014). Mozambique marine ecosystems review. 10.13140/2.1.2092.5766.</ref> North of the Zambezi delta the coast is studded with small islands, mainly of coral formation.\n\nThe northern coast is much indented, abounding in rocky headlands and rugged cliffs, with an almost continuous fringe of islands. On one of these islands is [[Island of Mozambique|Mozambique]], and immediately north of that port is [[Conducia Bay]]. Somewhat farther north are two large bays, [[Fernao Veloso Bay]] and [[Memba Bay]]. North of Fernao Veloso and Memba the largest bays are Pemba (where there is commodious anchorage for heavy draught vessels), Montepuesi and Tunghi, the last named having for its northern arm [[Cape Delgado]], the northernmost point on Mozambique's coast. Cape Delgado is part of the delta of the [[Ruvuma River]], which forms Mozambique's border with [[Tanzania]].\n\nThe northern coast is part of the [[East African coral coast]], a marine ecoregion that extends along the coasts of northern Mozambique, Tanzania, and Kenya.<ref>Spalding, Mark D., Helen E. Fox, Gerald R. Allen, Nick Davidson ''et al.'' \"Marine Ecoregions of the World: A Bioregionalization of Coastal and Shelf Areas\". ''Bioscience'' Vol. 57 No. 7, July/August 2007, pp. 573-583.</ref> Along the northern coast the [[Mozambique Current]], which flows south between [[Madagascar]] and the mainland, is close to the coast and scours out all the softer material, while at the same time the [[coral]]s are building in deep waters.\n\n===Orography===\nOrographically the backbone of the country is the mountain chain which forms the eastern escarpment of the continental plateau. It does not present a uniformly abrupt descent to the plains, but in places, as in the lower Zambezi district, slopes gradually to the coast. The [[Lebombo Mountains]], behind Delagoa Bay, nowhere exceed {{convert|2070|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in height. The [[Manica Plateau]], farther north between the Save and Zambezi rivers, is higher, rising towards the [[Eastern Highlands]] along the border with [[Zimbabwe]]. [[Monte Binga]]{{convert|2440|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, on the border with Zimbabwe, is Mozambique's highest peak. [[Mount Gorongosa]] ({{convert|6550|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) lies north-east of the Manica Plateau, and is, like it, of granitic formation. Gorongosa, rising isolated with precipitous outer slopes, has been likened in its aspect to a frowning citadel. East of Gorongosa a [[graben]] valley extends from the Zambezi to Pungwe Bay, the southern extension of the [[African Rift Valley]]. The [[Cheringoma Plateau]] lies east of the graben, sloping gently towards the coast.\n\nThe chief mountain range lies north of the Zambezi, and east of [[Lake Chilwa]], namely, the [[Namuli Mountains]], in which Namuli Peak rises to {{convert|8860|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and Molisani, Mruli and Mresi attain altitudes of {{convert|6500|to|8000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} These mountains are covered with magnificent forests. Farther north the river basins are divided by well-marked ranges with heights of {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and over. Near the south-east shore of [[Lake Malawi]] there is a high range ({{convert|5000|to|6000|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} with an abrupt descent to the lake - some {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in {{convert|6|mi|km|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The country between Malawi and Ibo is remarkable for the number of fantastically-shaped granite peaks, or [[inselberg]]s, which rise from the plateau. \n\nThe plateau lands west of the escarpment are of moderate elevation - perhaps averaging {{convert|2000|to|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} It is, however, only along the Zambezi and north of that river that Mozambique's territory reaches to the continental plateau. This northern plain has been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as part of the [[Eastern Miombo woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].\n\n===Rivers===\nBesides the Zambezi, the most considerable river in Mozambique is the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] which enters the [[Indian Ocean]] about {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} north of Maputo Bay. The [[Komati River|Komati]], Save, Busi and [[Pungwe River|Pungwe]] south of the Zambezi; the Lukugu, [[L\u00fario River|Lurio]], Montepuesi (Mtepwesi) and Msalu, with the [[Ruvuma River|Ruvuma]] (or Rovuma) and its affluent the [[Lugenda River|Lugenda]] (or Lujenda), to the north of it, are the other Mozambican rivers with considerable drainage areas. The [[Save River (Africa)|Save]] (Sabi) rises in [[Zimbabwe]] at an altitude of over {{convert|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and after flowing south for over {{convert|200|mi|km|0}} turns east and pierces the mountains some {{convert|170|mi|km|0}} from the coast, being joined near the Zimbabwe-Mozambique frontier by the Lundi. Cataracts entirely prevent navigation above this point.\n\nBelow the Lundi confluence the bed of the Save becomes considerably broader, varying from half a mile to two miles (3&nbsp;km). In the rainy season the Save is a large stream and even in the \"dries\" it can be navigated from its mouth by shallow draught steamers for over 150 miles. Its general direction through Portuguese territory is east by north. At its mouth it forms a delta {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} in extent. The Busi (220 miles) and Pungwe (180 miles) are streams north of and similar in character to the Save. They both rise in the Manica Plateau and enter the ocean in [[Pungwe Bay]], their mouths a mile or two apart.\n\nThe lower reaches of both streams are navigable, the Busi for {{convert|25|mi|km|0}}, the Pungwe for about {{convert|2|mi|1}}. At the mouth of the Pungwe is the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]]. Of the north-Zambezi streams the [[Lukugu River|Lukugu]], rising in the hills south-east of Lake Chilwa, flows south and enters the ocean not far north of [[Quelimane]]. The L\u00fario, rising in the Namuli Mountains, flows north-east, having a course of some {{convert|200|mi|km|0}}. The Montepuesi and the Msalu drain the country between the Lurio and Ruvuma basins. Their banks are in general well defined and the wet season rise seems fairly constant.\n\n===Somali Plate===\nGeologists have divided the Phanerozoic era of Mozambique's geology into the Karoo and post-Karoo era. This terminology is mostly used pertaining to studies of the structural and stratigraphic composition of rocks in the Zambezi valley.<ref>Nairn, Alan EM, Ian Lerche, and James E.

M., and R. A. Duncan. \"Age progressive volcanism in the Comores Archipelago, western Indian Ocean and implications for Somali plate tectonics.\" Earth and Planetary Science Letters 60.3 (1982): 415-428.</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Mozambique map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Mozambique map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification types]]\nMozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons, a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September. Climatic conditions vary depending on altitude. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south. \n\nAnnual precipitation varies from {{convert|500|to|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} depending on the region with an average of {{convert|590|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Cyclones are also common during the wet season. Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from {{convert|13|to|24|C|F|1}} in July to {{convert|22|to|31|C|F|1}} in February.\n\n== Facts ==\n'''Area:'''\n<br>''total:''\n{{convert|801,590|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}\n<br>''land:''\n786,380 km\u00b2\n<br>''water:''\n13,000 km\u00b2\n\n'''Capital'''\n*[[Maputo]] (Louren\u00e7o Marques)\n\n'''Major Cities'''\n*[[Matola]]\n*[[Nampula]]\n*[[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]]\n*[[Chimoio]]\n*[[Nacala]]\n*[[Quelimane]]\n*[[Tete]]\n*[[Lichinga]]\n*[[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]] (Porto Amelia)\n\n'''Other Cities'''\n*[[Angoche]] (Ant\u00f3nio Enes)\n\n'''Land boundaries:'''\n''total:'' 4,571 km\n<br>''border countries:''\n[[Malawi]] 1,569 km, South Africa 491 km, [[Swaziland]] 105&nbsp;km, [[Tanzania]] 756&nbsp;km, [[Zambia]] 419&nbsp;km, [[Zimbabwe]] 1,231&nbsp;km\n\n'''Coastline:'''\n2,470 km\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''\n<br>''territorial sea:''\n{{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}\n<br>''[[exclusive economic zone]]:''\n{{convert|578,986|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}\n\n'''Elevation extremes:'''\n<br>''lowest point:''\nIndian Ocean 0 m\n<br>''highest point:''\n[[Monte Binga]] 2 436 m\n\n'''Natural resources:'''\ncoal, titanium, natural gas, hydropower, tantalum, graphite\n\n'''Land use:'''\n<br>''arable land:''\n6.51% (2011), 5.43% (2005 est.), 3.98% (1998 est.)\n<br>''permanent crops:''\n0.25% (2011), 0.29% (2005 est.), 0.29% (1998 est.)\n<br>''other:''\n93.24% (2011), 94.28% (2005 est.), 95.73% (1998 est.)\n\n'''Irrigated land:'''\n1,181 km\u00b2 (2003)\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\n217.1 km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\n'''Natural hazards:'''\nsevere droughts; devastating cyclones and floods occur in central and southern provinces\n\n{{anchor|Environmental issues}}'''Environment - current issues:'''\na long civil war and recurrent drought in the hinterlands have resulted in increased [[human migration|migration]] of the population to urban and coastal areas with adverse environmental consequences; [[desertification]]; [[water pollution|pollution]] of surface and coastal waters; [[elephant]] [[poaching]] for [[ivory]] is a problem\n\n'''Environment - international agreements:'''\n<br>''party to:''\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\n'''Ecoregions'''\n* [[Eastern Miombo woodlands]]\n* [[Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic]]\n* [[Maputaland coastal forest mosaic]]\n* [[Southern Miombo woodlands]]\n* [[Southern Rift montane forest-grassland mosaic]]\n* [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]]\n* [[Zambezian coastal flooded savanna]]\n* [[Zambezian flooded grasslands]]\n* [[Zambezian halophytics]]\n* [[Zambezian and Mopane woodlands]]\n* [[East African mangroves]]\n\n==Extreme points==\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Mozambique]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point - Mouth of the [[Rovuma River]], [[Cabo Delgado Province]]\n* Easternmost point - unnamed headland east of the village of [[Amade]], [[Nampula Province]]\n* Southernmost point - unnamed location on the border with [[South Africa]] east of the South African town of Mosi, [[Maputo Province]]\n* Westernmost point - the point where the border with [[Zambia]] enters the Luangwa river, [[Tete Province]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mozambique]]\n*[[Monte Muambe]]\n*[[Volcanoes of Mozambique]]\n\n==References==\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|mz|Mozambique}}\n* [http://tourisminmozambique/mozambique-tourist-information/weather-in-maputo Weather in Mozambique]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from Free Tourist Information\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122613/http://www.places.co.za/mozambique/mozstats.html Mozambique Geography] from Southern Africa Places\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050507152150/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/world/mozambique/mozgeog.htm Mozambique - Geography and Environment] from Oxfam's \"Cool Planet\"\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045429/http://arkisto.gsf.fi/sp/sp48/sp48_pages035_063.pdf Integrated geological interpretation of remotely sensed data to support geological mapping in Mozambique] \n* {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mozambique |volume=18 |page=949 |short=1}}\n\n{{Geography of Africa}}\n{{Africa topic|Climate of}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Mozambique| ]]\n\n[[sv:Mo\u00e7ambique#Geografi]]\n", "name_user": "Tom Radulovich", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOrography:elevation format", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Mozambique"}
