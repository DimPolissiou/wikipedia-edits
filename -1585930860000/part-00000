Stanley is assigned to a  five-member group acting project.  He meets with Hanna and does not connect with this teacher.  She wants him to try harder and dig deeper.  After lunch with his psychologist father, he does a role playing his father who likes to tell bad jokes.  Dad does not want his son to be an actor.  Hanna really liked his performance and gave him a book from her own library to read.  She tells him acting is hard and he must go all the way.  Keep going.  Finally he has started acting.\n\nVictoria and Isolde are sisters and they talk a little about the scandal.  Isolde tells her sister that she likes Stanley.  Later Isolde tells Stanley she had seen Saladin with her sister.  There was no forced sex and it looked consensual to her.  Stanley's group has decided to use the sex scandal as their acting project.  Stanley has not told Isolde and William reminds him she should know.\n\nThe next in class assignment is to act an intimate scene.  William tells of an Easter dinner event where his father humiliates his mother.  Hanna did not like it.  He only told a story.  Intimacy requires the actor to bear his soul.  There must be trust.

Isolde invites Stanley and William over for a barbeque.  William plays with the family dog.  Victoria secretly borrows Stanley's phone to call her coach.  William wants Stanley to tell Isolde about their project and once again he fails to come clean.  Later the coach calls Stanley to tell Victoria that he has changed his mind. He is staying with his wife.\n\nHanna has heard of Stanley's girlfriend.  She tells him to call off a schoolgirl crush and not embarrass the Institute.  He sees Isolde and asks her to return his book, but can he just have one picture.  She tells him if you will find a private place, I will show you much more.  They have sex. They are in love.  Nonetheless the tennis project continues mocking teacher sex with a student.  During teacher Perry's class, they announce that William has died in a car crash.\n\nAt William's memorial service, Stanley sees Isolde kissing a girl. She tells him that she is sorry but he walks away.  Later at a rehearsal, Marnie asks Stanley did he drop Isolde because of the other girl or because of their play.  He says she was just too young. There was dissent at a student assembly.  Teacher Livia takes the student's side and thinks Dean Hanna Bauer cares more about her new theatre than student grief.  In fact she walks out.

Because of these scenes, it was banned in several countries, being labeled as [[child pornography]].\n\n==Plot==\nLaura (Lara Wendel, age 12) and Fabrizio (Martin Loeb, age 18) have been meeting every summer in the forest by her parent's summer home. Fabrizio is a solitary boy with only his dog for company; Laura is a sweet girl, but she lacks confidence. This summer new aspects enter into their story as both are growing up. The film represents them as part child, part adult. Part naive, part knowing. Laura is falling in love with Fabrizio, while he displays a new sexual awareness of her masked by his malice.\n\nFabrizio becomes inexplicably cruel. He accelerates his unwarranted torment of Laura in many ways, including tying her up and putting a snake near her and killing a pet bird she is fond of. Fabrizio prides himself on being 'king of the forest' and rubbishes Laura's tender attempts to be his queen. One day they climb the \"Blue Mountain\", a mysterious tall mountain at the forest's edge and discover ancient building ruins. Exploring these they find a cave. Inside, Fabrizio seduces Laura.\n\nFabrizio's cruel streak is boosted by his new sexual confidence. At one point he virtually forces himself on Laura, much to her upset. He does relent when she makes it clear she wants Fabrizio to be gentle with her, which he ridicules.\n\nThings develop further when they meet Sylvia (Eva Ionesco, age 12). Unlike the previously virginal Laura, Sylvia is confident and assertive. Fabrizio develops a fascination with her, eventually bribing Laura to fetch her to the forest to join them in play. Sylvia, aware of Fabrizio's interest in her, asserts herself in his affections, quickly replacing Laura and demoting her to servant and victim, which Fabrizio takes delight in. Laura, reluctant to leave her old friend and new lover, stays and becomes the target of the duo's ever progressing cruelty. At one point, they both 'hunt' Laura with bows and arrows and at another, pretend to throw her off a high ledge. They make love in front of her, insisting her punishment is that she must watch, leaving Laura confused and heartbroken.\n\nAt the end of summer, with the girls talking about returning to school, Fabrizio becomes pensive and agitated. He insists on taking Sylvia to the ruins for the first time. All three of them go into the cave to escape a thunderstorm and Fabrizio again pretends they are lost as he did with Laura. Sylvia breaks down sobbing for her mother, all traces of her confidence and maturity lost in the fear of being in the cave. Fabrizio repeatedly begs Sylvia to stay with him forever. In the morning, Sylvia is still lost in the cave and further rejects the desperate Fabrizio and his pleas to stay with him.

Because of these scenes, it was banned in several countries, being labeled as [[child pornography]].\n\n==Plot==\nLaura (Lara Wendel, age 12) and Fabrizio (Martin Loeb, age 18) have been meeting every summer in the forest by her parent's summer home. Fabrizio is a solitary boy with only his dog for company; Laura is a sweet girl, but she lacks confidence. This summer new aspects enter into their story as both are growing up. The film represents them as part child, part adult. Part naive, part knowing. Laura is falling in love with Fabrizio, while he displays a new sexual awareness of her masked by his malice.\n\nFabrizio becomes inexplicably cruel. He accelerates his unwarranted torment of Laura in many ways, including tying her up and putting a snake near her and killing a pet bird she is fond of. Fabrizio prides himself on being 'king of the forest' and rubbishes Laura's tender attempts to be his queen. One day they climb the \"Blue Mountain\", a mysterious tall mountain at the forest's edge and discover ancient building ruins. Exploring these they find a cave. Inside, Fabrizio seduces Laura.\n\nFabrizio's cruel streak is boosted by his new sexual confidence. At one point he virtually forces himself on Laura, much to her upset. He does relent when she makes it clear she wants Fabrizio to be gentle with her, which he ridicules.\n\nThings develop further when they meet Sylvia (Eva Ionesco, age 12). Unlike the previously virginal Laura, Sylvia is confident and assertive. Fabrizio develops a fascination with her, eventually bribing Laura to fetch her to the forest to join them in play. Sylvia, aware of Fabrizio\u2019s interest in her, asserts herself in his affections, quickly replacing Laura and demoting her to servant and victim, which Fabrizio takes delight in. Laura, reluctant to leave her old friend and new lover, stays and becomes the target of the duo's ever progressing cruelty. At one point, they both 'hunt' Laura with bows and arrows and at another, pretend to throw her off a high ledge. They make love in front of her, insisting her punishment is that she must watch, leaving Laura confused and heartbroken.\n\nAt the end of summer, with the girls talking about returning to school, Fabrizio becomes pensive and agitated. He insists on taking Sylvia to the ruins for the first time. All three of them go into the cave to escape a thunderstorm and Fabrizio again pretends they are lost as he did with Laura. Sylvia breaks down sobbing for her mother, all traces of her confidence and maturity lost in the fear of being in the cave. Fabrizio repeatedly begs Sylvia to stay with him forever. In the morning, Sylvia is still lost in the cave and further rejects the desperate Fabrizio and his pleas to stay with him. She becomes hysterical and he kills her with a knife, feeling it is the only way he won't lose her. He stays with the dead body and gives Laura the flashlight telling her she knows the way home and Laura reluctantly leaves.

Daniel Lovejoy named his son \"Elijah Parish\" in honor of his close friend and mentor, [[Elijah Parish]], a minister who was also involved in politics.<ref>Dillon, p3.</ref> Due to his own lack of an education, he encouraged his sons\u2014Elijah, Daniel, Joseph Cammett, [[Owen Lovejoy|Owen]], and John\u2014to become educated men. As a result, Elijah was taught to read the Bible and other religious texts at an early age.<ref name=\"Lovejoy and Lovejoy, pp. 18\u201319\">Lovejoy and Lovejoy, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nAfter completing his early studies in public schools, Lovejoy attended the [[Monmouth Academy (Maine)|Academy at Monmouth]] and [[China, Maine|China]] Academy. After becoming proficient enough in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]], he enrolled at [[Colby College|Waterville College]] (now Colby College) in [[Waterville, Maine]], as a sophomore in 1823.<ref name=\"Lovejoy and Lovejoy, pp. 18\u201319\"/> He excelled in his studies, and upon faculty recommendation, from 1824 until his 1826 graduation, while still an undergraduate, he also served as headmaster of Colby\u2019s associated high school, the Latin School (later [[Coburn Classical Institute]]). Lovejoy received financial support from minister [[Benjamin Tappan]] to continue his attendance at Waterville College.<ref name=\"Dillonp5\">Dillon, p5.</ref> His cousin [[Nathan A. Farwell]] later served as a U.S. Senator from Maine.\n\nIn September 1826, Lovejoy graduated ''cum laude'' from Waterville College,<ref>Lovejoy and Lovejoy, p. 23</ref> of which he was [[valedictorian]].<ref>Dillon, p6.</ref> During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West.<ref>Dillon, p7.</ref> Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to [[Boston]] to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination.<ref>Dillon, p9.</ref> Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in [[New York City]] in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the ''Saturday Evening Gazette'' as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he walked up and down streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of getting them to subscribe to the newspaper.<ref name=\"Dillonp10\">Dillon, p10.</ref> Struggling with his finances, he wrote to [[Jeremiah Chaplin]], the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed.<ref name=\"Dillonp10\"/> Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching [[Hillsboro, Illinois|Hillsboro]], [[Montgomery County, Illinois|Montgomery County]], in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis, where he settled the same year.<ref>Dillon, p11.</ref>\n\n==St. Louis==\nA major port in a slave state surrounded by free ones, St. Louis was a center of both abolitionist and [[pro-slavery]] factions. From 1814 to 1860, more than three hundred [http://digital.wustl.edu/legalencodingproject/ freedom suits] were filed by slaves to gain freedom, often based on their having lived in free territory with their masters. At the same time, it was an area where both free Blacks and slaves worked in the city, especially on the waterfront and [[steamboat]]s.\n\nIn St. Louis, Lovejoy quickly became ill, but once recovered, he operated a school with a friend, modeled on high schools in the East. His interest in teaching waned, however, when local editors began accepting his poems in their newspapers. This led him to a partnership with T. J. Miller as an editor on the ''St. Louis Times'', a paper that supported [[Henry Clay]] for President in 1832. Working at the ''Times'' introduced him to like-minded community leaders, many of whom were members of the [[American Colonization Society]], that supported sending freed American blacks to Africa. Among these new acquaintances were [[Edward Bates]], [[Hamilton R. Gamble]], and Archibald Gamble. Lovejoy occasionally hired slaves to work with him at the paper, one of whom, [[William Wells Brown]], later recounted his experience in a memoir. Brown described Lovejoy as \"a very good man, and decidedly the best master that I had ever had. I am chiefly indebted to him, and to my employment in the printing office, for what little learning I obtained while in slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|first=William W.\n|last=Brown\n|title=Narrative of William W. Brown, a Fugitive Slave, written by himself\n|location=Boston\n|year=1847\n|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15132/15132-h/15132-h.htm#CHAPTER_IV}}</ref>\n\nHe worked as an editor of an anti-[[Andrew Jackson|Jacksonian]] newspaper, the ''[[St. Louis Observer]]'', and ran a school. Five years later, he studied at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in [[New Jersey]] and became an ordained [[Presbyterian]] preacher. Returning to St. Louis, he set up a church and resumed work as editor of the ''Observer''. His editorials criticized [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and other church denominations.\n\nLovejoy struggled with his interest in religion, often writing his parents about his sinfulness and rebellion against God. He attended revival meetings in 1831 led by William S. Potts, pastor of First Presbyterian Church that rekindled his interest in religion for a time. However, Lovejoy admitted to his parents that \"gradually these feelings all left me, and I returned to the world a more hardened sinner than ever.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865|last = Van Ravenswaay|first = Charles|publisher = Missouri History Museum|year = 1991}}</ref> A year later, Lovejoy found the call to God he desired. In 1832, influenced by the [[Revivalism|Christian revivalist movement]] led by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[David Nelson (Presbyterian)|David Nelson]], he joined the First Presbyterian Church and decided to become a preacher.<ref>Balmer, p. 346.</ref> He sold his interest in the ''Times,'' returned East to study at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and upon completion, went to Philadelphia, where he became an ordained minister of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]] in April of 1833. Friends in St. Louis offered to finance a Presbyterian newspaper there if Lovejoy would agree to edit it. Lovejoy accepted and on November 22, 1833, the first issue of the ''St. Louis Observer'' was published.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn spring 1834, Lovejoy penned a number of articles and editorials criticizing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. The large Catholic community of St. Louis was offended by these attacks, but Lovejoy did not back down. He continued his critical writings to include editorials on tobacco and liquor as well. That same year, Lovejoy began editorializing on slavery, the most controversial social issue of that time. His views were influenced by Nelson, an abolitionist. In 1835, the ''Missouri Republican'' began suggesting gradual emancipation in Missouri, and Lovejoy supported this endeavor through the ''Observer.'' Lovejoy's views on slavery began to incite complaints and threats. By October 1835, there were rumors of mob action against the ''Observer.'' A group of prominent St. Louisans, including many of Lovejoy's friends, wrote a letter pleading him to cease discussion of slavery in the newspaper. Lovejoy was away from the city at this time and the publishers declared that no further articles on slavery would appear during Lovejoy's absence and, when he returned, he would follow a more rigorous editorial policy. Lovejoy wrote a response to the letter, making it clear he did not agree with the publishers policy. As tensions over slavery escalated in St. Louis, Lovejoy would not back down from his convictions and had a sense he would become a martyr for the cause. He was asked to resign as editor of the ''Observer'', to which he agreed. However, the newspaper's owners released the ''Observer'' property to the moneylender who held the mortgage and the new owners asked Lovejoy to stay on as editor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLovejoy and ''The Observer'' continued to be embroiled in controversy. In April 1836, a mulatto boatman, [[Burning of Francis McIntosh|Francis McIntosh]], was arrested by two policemen and, en route to the jail, McIntosh grabbed a knife and stabbed both men. One was killed and the other seriously injured. Although McIntosh attempted to escape, he was caught and a mob tied him up and burned him to death. Some of the mob were brought before a grand jury to face charges. However, the presiding judge, Judge Lawless, refused to convict anyone and considered the crime a spontaneous mob action without any specific people to prosecute. The judge made remarks insinuating that abolitionists, including Lovejoy and the ''Observer,'' had incited McIntosh into stabbing the policemen. With already negative attention on him, Lawless' opinion did nothing to help Lovejoy and in May, Lovejoy decided to move the ''Observer'' to Alton, Illinois.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1835, Lovejoy married Celia Ann French, of [[St. Charles, Missouri]], and they had two children.\n\n==Move to Alton==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs have no citations-->\nIn May 1836, after anti-abolitionist opponents in St. Louis destroyed his printing press for the third time, Lovejoy left the city and moved across the river to [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], in the [[Slave states and free states|free state]] of Illinois. Before he could move the press, an [[angry mob]] broke into the ''Observer'' office and vandalized it. Only Alderman and future mayor [[Bryan Mullanphy]] attempted to stop the crime, and no policemen or city officials intervened. Lovejoy packed what remained of the office for shipment to Alton.

Many in Alton began questioning allowing Lovejoy to continue printing in their town. After an [[Panic of 1837|economic crisis in March 1837]], Alton citizens wondered if Lovejoy's views were contributing to hard times.

They sent a boy up with a torch to set fire to the wooden roof. Lovejoy and his supporter Royal Weller went outside, surprised the pro-slavery partisans, pushed over the ladder and retreated back inside the warehouse. The mob put up the ladder again; when Lovejoy and Weller went out to overturn it, they were spotted and shot.

The mob destroyed the new printing press by carrying it to a window and throwing it out onto the riverbank. They broke it up and threw the pieces into the river.\n\nAfter his death, his brother [[Owen Lovejoy]] entered politics and became the leader of the Illinois abolitionists. Francis Butter Murdoch, the district attorney of Alton, prosecuted Lovejoy's murder but no one was convicted. The jury foreman had been a member of the mob and was wounded in the attack. The presiding judge also doubled as a witness to the proceedings.

He reminded the audience that he was a hardworking and God-fearing citizen who had broken no laws, and that the physical threats to him and his family were totally unjustified.

Daniel Lovejoy named his son \"Elijah Parish\" in honor of his close friend and mentor, [[Elijah Parish]], a minister who was also involved in politics.<ref>Dillon, p3.</ref> Due to his own lack of an education, he encouraged his sons\u2014Elijah, Daniel, Joseph Cammett, [[Owen Lovejoy|Owen]], and John\u2014to become educated men. As a result, Elijah was taught to read the Bible and other religious texts at an early age.<ref name=\"Lovejoy and Lovejoy, pp. 18\u201319\">Lovejoy and Lovejoy, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nAfter completing his early studies in public schools, Lovejoy attended the [[Monmouth Academy (Maine)|Academy at Monmouth]] and [[China, Maine|China]] Academy. After becoming proficient enough in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]], he enrolled at [[Colby College|Waterville College]] (now Colby College) in [[Waterville, Maine]], as a sophomore in 1823.<ref name=\"Lovejoy and Lovejoy, pp. 18\u201319\"/> He excelled in his studies, and upon faculty recommendation, from 1824 until his 1826 graduation, while still an undergraduate, he also served as headmaster of Colby\u2019s associated high school, the Latin School (later [[Coburn Classical Institute]]). Lovejoy received financial support from minister [[Benjamin Tappan]] to continue his attendance at Waterville College.<ref name=\"Dillonp5\">Dillon, p5.</ref> His cousin [[Nathan A. Farwell]] later served as a U.S. Senator from Maine.\n\nIn September 1826, Lovejoy graduated ''cum laude'' from Waterville College,<ref>Lovejoy and Lovejoy, p. 23</ref> of which he was [[valedictorian]].<ref>Dillon, p6.</ref> During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West.<ref>Dillon, p7.</ref> Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to [[Boston]] to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination.<ref>Dillon, p9.</ref> Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in [[New York City]] in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the ''Saturday Evening Gazette'' as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he walked up and down streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of getting them to subscribe to the newspaper.<ref name=\"Dillonp10\">Dillon, p10.</ref> Struggling with his finances, he wrote to [[Jeremiah Chaplin]], the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed.<ref name=\"Dillonp10\"/> Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching [[Hillsboro, Illinois|Hillsboro]], [[Montgomery County, Illinois|Montgomery County]], in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis, where he settled the same year.<ref>Dillon, p11.</ref>\n\n==St. Louis==\nA major port in a slave state surrounded by free ones, St. Louis was a center of both abolitionist and [[pro-slavery]] factions. From 1814 to 1860, more than three hundred [http://digital.wustl.edu/legalencodingproject/ freedom suits] were filed by slaves to gain freedom, often based on their having lived in free territory with their masters. At the same time, it was an area where both free Blacks and slaves worked in the city, especially on the waterfront and [[steamboat]]s.\n\nIn St. Louis, Lovejoy quickly became ill, but once recovered, he operated a school with a friend, modeled on high schools in the East. His interest in teaching waned, however, when local editors began accepting his poems in their newspapers. This led him to a partnership with T. J. Miller as an editor on the ''St. Louis Times'', a paper that supported [[Henry Clay]] for President in 1832. Working at the ''Times'' introduced him to like-minded community leaders, many of whom were members of the [[American Colonization Society]], that supported sending freed American blacks to Africa. Among these new acquaintances were [[Edward Bates]], [[Hamilton R. Gamble]], and Archibald Gamble. Lovejoy occasionally hired slaves to work with him at the paper, one of whom, [[William Wells Brown]], later recounted his experience in a memoir. Brown described Lovejoy as \"a very good man, and decidedly the best master that I had ever had. I am chiefly indebted to him, and to my employment in the printing office, for what little learning I obtained while in slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|first=William W.\n|last=Brown\n|title=Narrative of William W.

Five years later, he studied at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in [[New Jersey]] and became an ordained [[Presbyterian]] preacher. Returning to St. Louis, he set up a church and resumed work as editor of the ''Observer''. His editorials criticized [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and other church denominations.\n\nLovejoy struggled with his interest in religion, often writing his parents about his sinfulness and rebellion against God. He attended revival meetings in 1831 led by William S. Potts, pastor of First Presbyterian Church that rekindled his interest in religion for a time. However, Lovejoy admitted to his parents that \"gradually these feelings all left me, and I returned to the world a more hardened sinner than ever.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865|last = Van Ravenswaay|first = Charles|publisher = Missouri History Museum|year = 1991}}</ref> A year later, Lovejoy found the call to God he desired. In 1832, influenced by the [[Revivalism|Christian revivalist movement]] led by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[David Nelson (Presbyterian)|David Nelson]], he joined the First Presbyterian Church and decided to become a preacher.<ref>Balmer, p. 346.</ref> He sold his interest in the ''Times,'' returned East to study at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and upon completion, went to Philadelphia, where he became an ordained minister of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]] in April of 1833. Friends in St. Louis offered to finance a Presbyterian newspaper there if Lovejoy would agree to edit it. Lovejoy accepted and on November 22, 1833, the first issue of the ''St. Louis Observer'' was published.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn spring 1834, Lovejoy penned a number of articles and editorials criticizing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. The large Catholic community of St. Louis was offended by these attacks, but Lovejoy did not back down. He continued his critical writings to include editorials on tobacco and liquor as well. That same year, Lovejoy began editorializing on slavery, the most controversial social issue of that time. His views were influenced by Nelson, an abolitionist. In 1835, the ''Missouri Republican'' began suggesting gradual emancipation in Missouri, and Lovejoy supported this endeavor through the ''Observer.'' Lovejoy's views on slavery began to incite complaints and threats. By October 1835, there were rumors of mob action against the ''Observer.'' A group of prominent St. Louisans, including many of Lovejoy's friends, wrote a letter pleading him to cease discussion of slavery in the newspaper. Lovejoy was away from the city at this time and the publishers declared that no further articles on slavery would appear during Lovejoy's absence and, when he returned, he would follow a more rigorous editorial policy. Lovejoy wrote a response to the letter, making it clear he did not agree with the publishers policy. As tensions over slavery escalated in St. Louis, Lovejoy would not back down from his convictions and had a sense he would become a martyr for the cause. He was asked to resign as editor of the ''Observer'', to which he agreed. However, the newspaper's owners released the ''Observer'' property to the moneylender who held the mortgage and the new owners asked Lovejoy to stay on as editor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLovejoy and ''The Observer'' continued to be embroiled in controversy. In April 1836, a mulatto boatman, [[Burning of Francis McIntosh|Francis McIntosh]], was arrested by two policemen and, en route to the jail, McIntosh grabbed a knife and stabbed both men. One was killed and the other seriously injured. Although McIntosh attempted to escape, he was caught and a mob tied him up and burned him to death. Some of the mob were brought before a grand jury to face charges. However, the presiding judge, Judge Lawless, refused to convict anyone and considered the crime a spontaneous mob action without any specific people to prosecute. The judge made remarks insinuating that abolitionists, including Lovejoy and the ''Observer,'' had incited McIntosh into stabbing the policemen. With already negative attention on him, Lawless' opinion did nothing to help Lovejoy and in May, Lovejoy decided to move the ''Observer'' to Alton, Illinois.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1835, Lovejoy married Celia Ann French, of [[St. Charles, Missouri]], and they had two children.\n\n==Move to Alton==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs have no citations-->\nIn May 1836, after anti-abolitionist opponents in St. Louis destroyed his printing press for the third time, Lovejoy left the city and moved across the river to [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], in the [[Slave states and free states|free state]] of Illinois. Before he could move the press, an [[angry mob]] broke into the ''Observer'' office and vandalized it. Only Alderman and future mayor [[Bryan Mullanphy]] attempted to stop the crime, and no policemen or city officials intervened. Lovejoy packed what remained of the office for shipment to Alton.

Many escaped slaves crossed the [[Mississippi River]] from [[Missouri]], a slave state.

Many in Alton began questioning allowing Lovejoy to continue printing in their town. After an [[Panic of 1837|economic crisis in March 1837]], Alton citizens wondered if Lovejoy's views were contributing to hard times. They felt Southern states, or even St. Louis, might not want to do business with their town if they continued to harbor an abolitionist.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Memorial card for Reverend Elijah Parish Lovejoy with silhouette.jpg|thumb|Mid 19th century memorial card for Reverend Elijah Parish Lovejoy with silhouette]]\n\nLovejoy held the Illinois Antislavery Congress at the Presbyterian church in Upper Alton on October 26, 1837. The supporters in attendance were surprised to see two pro-slavery advocates in the crowd, [[John Hogan (Missouri)|John Hogan]] and Illinois Attorney General [[Usher F. Linder]].

When Lovejoy and his men returned fire, they hit several people in the crowd, killing a man named Bishop.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\nThe leaders of the mob set up a ladder against the warehouse. They sent a boy up with a torch to set fire to the wooden roof. Lovejoy and his supporter Royal Weller went outside, surprised the pro-slavery partisans, pushed over the ladder and retreated back inside the warehouse. The mob put up the ladder again; when Lovejoy and Weller went out to overturn it, they were spotted and shot. Lovejoy was hit five times with slugs from a shotgun and died immediately; Weller was wounded. The mob destroyed the new printing press by carrying it to a window and throwing it out onto the riverbank. They broke it up and threw the pieces into the river.\n\nAfter his death, his brother [[Owen Lovejoy]] entered politics and became the leader of the Illinois abolitionists. Francis Butter Murdoch, the district attorney of Alton, prosecuted Lovejoy's murder but no one was convicted. The jury foreman had been a member of the mob and was wounded in the attack. The presiding judge also doubled as a witness to the proceedings. These conflicts of interest resulted in a \"not guilty\" verdict.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLovejoy was considered a [[martyr]] by the abolition movement. In his name, his brother Owen became the leader of the Illinois abolitionists. Owen and his brother Joseph wrote a memoir about Elijah, which was published in 1838 by the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] in New York and distributed widely among abolitionists in the nation. With his murder symbolic of the rising tensions within the country, Lovejoy is called the \"first casualty of the Civil War.\"<ref name=\"Tide Without Turning 1958\"/>\n\nElijah Lovejoy was buried in Alton Cemetery in an unmarked grave. In 1860, Thomas Dimmock, editor of the ''Alton Democrat'', located the grave and arranged for a proper grave marker. Some of his supporters were later buried near him.\n\nOn November 2, 1837, five days before his death, he gave an emotive speech in Alton on the abolition question. In it, he asserted his willingness to respect the views of his opponents, but claimed the right to challenge them, as guaranteed in the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. He reminded the audience that he was a hardworking and God-fearing citizen who had broken no laws, and that the physical threats to him and his family were totally unjustified. He ended by declaring that he would not be driven away, but would continue his work in Alton.<ref>Joseph P. and Owen Lovejoy, The Martyrdom of Lovejoy, An Account of the Life, Trials, and Perils of Rev.

Lovejoy (1838).</ref>{{page number needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere was such fear at the time of Lovejoy's death that no service was held, and the town newspaper he had led did not even report his death, though many other newspapers around the country decried this murder. The 1837 mob killing of Elijah Lovejoy was finally commemorated by a monument in Alton's City Cemetery, installed sixty years later in 1897. Another sixty years passed before [[John Glanville Gill]] published the first full-length biography of the slain abolitionist minister and editor.

The city is located in a well-watered and fertile valley on the [[Orontes River]], about 20 kilometers (12 mi) from the [[Levantine Sea]].\n\nToday's city stands partly on the site of the ancient '''[[Antioch]]''' ({{lang-grc|\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}, {{transl|grc|Anti\u00f3kheia}}, also known as \"Antioch on the Orontes\"), which was founded in the 4th century BC by the [[Seleucid]]. Antioch later became one of the [[Roman Empire]]'s largest cities, and was made the capital of the provinces of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and [[Coele-Syria (Roman province)|Coele-Syria]]. It was also an influential early center of [[Christianity]], and gained much ecclesiastical importance in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Captured by the [[Umar ibn al-Khattab|caliph Umar]] in the 7th century, the medieval '''Antakiyah''' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u0646\u0637\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0629}}, {{transl|ar|\u02beAn\u1e6d\u0101kiya}}) was conquered or re-conquered several times: by the Byzantine in 969, the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] in 1084,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ].</ref> the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in 1098,<ref name=\"Ronald Roberson\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ovotAAAAYAAJ].</ref> the [[Ayyubid]] in 1187, the [[Mamluk]] in 1268,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R2ZhDgAAQBAJ].</ref> and eventually the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] in 1517,<ref name=\"Ronald Roberson\"/> who would integrate it to the [[Aleppo Eyalet]] then to the [[Aleppo Vilayet]]. The city joined the [[Hatay State]] under the [[French Mandate]] before joining the [[Turkish Republic]].\n\nMost of the population, which was approximately 216,960 as of 2012, speaks Turkish as their native language, while a minority are native Arabic speakers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{Main|Antioch}}\nThe area of Antioch has been occupied by humans since the [[Calcolithic]] era (6th millennium BC), as revealed by [[archeological]] excavations of the mound of [[Tell Atchana|Tell-A\u00e7ana]], among others.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe King of Macedon [[Alexander the Great]], after defeating the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] in the [[Battle of Issus]] in 333 BC, followed the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] south into Syria and occupied the area. The city of Antioch was founded in 300 BC, after the death of Alexander, by the Hellenistic [[Seleucid]] King [[Seleucus I Nicator]].{{fact|date=January 2019}} It played an important role as one of the largest cities in the Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom, in the [[Roman Empire]], and in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was a key city during the early [[history of Christianity]], in particular that of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church]], as well as during the [[rise of Islam]] and [[the Crusades]].\n\n===Rashidun period===\n[[File:Fall of Antioch in 969.png|thumb|Recapture of Antioch in 969]]\n\nIn 637, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]], Antioch was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] during the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge]]. The city became known in Arabic as {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646\u0637\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0629}} ({{transl|ar|\u02beAn\u1e6d\u0101kiya}}). Since the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] was unable to penetrate the [[Anatolia]]n plateau, Antioch found itself on the frontline of the conflicts between two hostile empires during the next 350&nbsp;years, so that the city went into a precipitous decline.\n\nIn 969, the city was reconquered for the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] by [[Michael Bourtzes]] and the ''[[stratopedarches]]'' [[Peter (stratopedarches)|Peter]]. It soon became the seat of a ''[[dux]]'', who commanded the forces of the local [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]] and was the most important officer on the Empire's eastern border,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} held by such men as [[Nikephoros Ouranos]]. In 1078, [[Philaretos Brachamios]], an Armenian rebel, seized power. He held the city until the [[Seljuk Turks]] captured it from him in 1084. The [[Sultanate of Rum]] held it only fourteen years before the Crusaders arrived.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}\n\n===Crusader era===\n[[File:Capture of Antioch by Bohemond of Tarente in June 1098.JPG|left|thumb|[[Capture of Antioch]] by [[Louis Gallait]]]]\n{{Main|Principality of Antioch}}\nThe Crusaders' [[Siege of Antioch]] during the [[First Crusade]] resulted in its fall. The Crusaders caused significant damage, including a three-day massacre of its population, both Christian and Muslim. Following the defeat of the Turkish garrison, [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond I]] became its overlord. It remained the capital of the Latin [[Principality of Antioch]] for nearly two centuries.\n\nIn 1268 it fell to the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baibars]] after [[Siege of Antioch (1268)|another siege]]. Baibars proceeded to massacre the Christian population.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/30*.html Vahan M. Kurkjian, \"New Scourge from Egypt\", in ''A History of Armenia'']</ref> In addition to suffering the ravages of war, the city lost its commercial importance because trade routes to [[East Asia]] moved north following the 13th-century [[Mongol]] conquests. Antioch never recovered as a major city, with much of its former role falling to the port city of [[Alexandretta]] (''\u0130skenderun''). An account of both cities as they were in 1675 appears in the diary of the English naval chaplain [[Henry Teonge]].\n\n===Ottoman city===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:AntiochMap1912.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Densely built Antakya in 1912: the traditional Muslim city shows no trace of its Hellenistic planning. To the east, orchards (green) fill the plain.]]\nThe city was the center of the [[Sanjak]] of Antakya, part of the [[Damascus Eyalet]].\n\nIn 1822 (and again in 1872), Antakya was hit by an earthquake and damaged.  When Ottoman general [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] established his headquarters in the city in 1835, it had only some 5,000 inhabitants.  Supporters hoped the city might develop thanks to the [[Euphrates]] Valley [[Railway]], which was supposed to link it to the port of Sueida (now ''[[Samanda\u011f\u0131 (city)|Samanda\u011f\u0131]]''). However, such plans were doomed to come to naught. This scheme is the subject of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem {{ws|[[s:Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837/Antioch|Antioch]]}} (1836) in which she reflects of the superiority of trade and commerce over war and conflict. The city suffered repeated outbreaks of [[cholera]] due to inadequate infrastructure for sanitation.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}  Later the city developed and rapidly resumed much of its old importance when a railway was built along the lower Orontes Valley.\n\n===Republic of Hatay and modern Turkey===\nSee [[Hatay Province]] for the history of the region during the demise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the short-lived [[Republic of Hatay]] (in 1938), and the area's incorporation into the Republic of Turkey in 1939.\n\n==Demographics in 1935==\nIn 1935, Turkish and Arab Muslims made more than 80% of population.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Census of 1935<ref name=dump>{{cite book|last=Dumper|first=Michael|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA40|page=40}}</ref><ref name=julian>{{cite book|last=Go|first=Julian|title=Decentering Social Theory|date=2013|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781781907276|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReJbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA31&dq=1935+census}}</ref> \n|- \n!

Antakya was originally centred on the east bank of the river.  Since the 19th century, the city has expanded with new neighbourhoods built on the plains across the river to the south-west, and four bridges connect the old and new cities. Many of the buildings of the last two decades are styled as concrete blocks, and Antakya has lost much of its classic beauty.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The narrow streets of the old city can become clogged with traffic.\n\nAlthough the port city [[Iskenderun]] has become the largest city in Hatay, Antakya is a provincial capital still of considerable importance as the centre of a large district.  The draining of [[Lake Amik]] and development of land has caused the region's economy to grow in wealth and productivity. The town is a lively shopping and business centre with many restaurants, cinemas and other amenities. This district is centred on a large park opposite the governor's building and the central avenue ''Kurtulu\u015f Caddes\u0131''. The tea gardens, cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood of ''[[Harbiye, Antakya|Harbiye]]'' are popular destinations, particularly for the variety of ''[[meze]]'' in the restaurants. The [[Orontes river|Orontes]] River can be malodorous when water is low in summer. Rather than formal nightlife, in the summer heat, people will stay outside until late in the night to walk with their families and friends, and munch on snacks.\n\nIts location near the Syrian border makes Antakya more cosmopolitan than many cities in Turkey. It did not attract the mass immigration of people from eastern Anatolia in the 1980s and 1990s that radically swelled the populations of Mediterranean cities such as [[Adana]] and [[Mersin]]. Both [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic]] are still widely spoken in Antakya, although written Arabic is rarely used. A mixed community of faiths and denominations co-exist peacefully here.  Although almost all the inhabitants are [[Muslim]], a substantial proportion adhere to the [[Alevi]] and the Arab Alawi traditions, in 'Harbiye' there is a place to honour the saint [[Khidr|H\u0131z\u0131r]]. Numerous tombs of saints, of both [[Sunni]] and [[Alawite]], are located throughout the city.  Several small Christian communities are active in the city, with the largest church being St. Peter and St. Paul on Hurriyet Caddesi. With its long history of spiritual and religious movements, Antakya is a place of pilgrimage for Christians. The Jewish community of Antakya had shrunk to 14 members in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chudacoff|first1=Danya|title=Turkey's Jewish community longs for the past|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/turkey-jewish-community-antakya-20144227111824684.html|website=Aljazeera|accessdate=February 18, 2018|date=May 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>Avotaynu: the international review of Jewish genealogy, Volume 14, G.

The city is in a valley surrounded by mountains, the [[Nur Mountains]] (ancient Amanos) to the north and Mount Kelda\u011f (Jebel Akra) to the south, with the 440 m high Mount Habib-i Neccar (the ancient Mount Silpius) forming its eastern limits. The mountains are a source of a green [[marble]]. Antakya is at the northern edge of the [[Dead Sea Rift]] and vulnerable to earthquakes.\n\nThe plain of [[Amik]] to the north-east of the city is fertile soil watered by the Orontes, the [[Karasu (Hatay)|Karasu]] and the [[Afrin River|Afrin]] rivers; the lake in the plain was drained in 1980 by a French company. At the same time channels were built to widen the Orontes and let it pass neatly through the city centre. The Orontes is joined in Antakya by the Hac\u0131 K\u00fcr\u00fc\u015f stream to the north-east of the city near the church of St Peter, and the Ham\u015fen which runs down from Habib-i Neccar to the south-west, under Memekli Bridge near the army barracks. Flora includes the [[bay Laurel|bay tree]]s and [[Myrtle (plant)|myrtle]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe city enjoys a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with hot and dry summers, and mild and wet winters; however due to its higher altitude, Antakya has slightly cooler temperatures than the coast.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Antakya\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high F = 51\n|Feb high F = 57\n|Mar high F = 64\n|Apr high F = 71\n|May high F = 78\n|Jun high F = 82\n|Jul high F = 86\n|Aug high F = 87\n|Sep high F = 86\n|Oct high F = 80\n|Nov high F = 68\n|Dec high F = 55\n|year high F = 71\n|Jan low F = 39\n|Feb low F = 41\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 51\n|May low F = 59\n|Jun low F = 68\n|Jul low F = 73\n|Aug low F = 75\n|Sep low F = 68\n|Oct low F = 57\n|Nov low F = 46\n|Dec low F = 41\n|year low F = 55\n|Jan precipitation inch = 7.5\n|Feb precipitation inch = 6.5\n|Mar precipitation inch = 5.6\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.2\n|May precipitation inch = 3.2\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.3\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.3\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.1\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Nov precipitation inch = 4.3\n|Dec precipitation inch = 7.5\n|year precipitation inch = 45.1\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name=Weatherbase>{{cite web\n| url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=173702&refer=&units=us |title =Weatherbase: Weather for Antakya, Turkey | publisher=Weatherbase | year=2011 }} Retrieved on November 22, 2011.</ref>\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n\n==Education==\n[[Mustafa Kemal University]], abbreviated as MKU, has several faculties including Engineering and Medicine, while having a campus called Tayfur S\u00f6kmen located in Serinyol district {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}, north of Antakya (centrum).\nEstablished in 1992, currently more than 32,000 students enrolled at the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mku.edu.tr/main.php?page=readpage&id=980&location=oidb |publisher=MKU |title=About Mustafa Kemal University (MKU) |accessdate=2011-03-26 }}</ref>\n\nBesides the campus in Serinyol, MKU has its faculties spread out in all main districts of the province including Alt\u0131n\u00f6z\u00fc, Antakya, Belen, D\u00f6rtyol, Erzin, Hassa, \u0130skenderun, K\u0131r\u0131khan, Reyhanl\u0131, Samanda\u011f and Yaylada\u011f\u0131.\n\n==Main sights==\nThe long and varied history has created many architectural sites of interest.

Its cuisine is considered [[Levantine cuisine|levantine]] rather than [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]]. The cuisine offers plenty of meals, where beef and lambs are mainly used.

It soon became the seat of a ''[[dux]]'', who commanded the forces of the local [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]] and was the most important officer on the Empire's eastern border,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} held by such men as [[Nikephoros Ouranos]]. In 1078, [[Philaretos Brachamios]], an Armenian rebel, seized power. He held the city until the [[Seljuk Turks]] captured it from him in 1084.

To the east, orchards (green) fill the plain.]]\nThe city was the center of the [[Sanjak]] of Antakya, part of the [[Damascus Eyalet]].\n\nIn 1822 (and again in 1872), Antakya was hit by an earthquake and damaged.  When Ottoman general [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] established his headquarters in the city in 1835, it had only some 5,000 inhabitants.  Supporters hoped the city might develop thanks to the [[Euphrates]] Valley [[Railway]], which was supposed to link it to the port of Sueida (now ''[[Samanda\u011f\u0131 (city)|Samanda\u011f\u0131]]''). However, such plans were doomed to come to naught. This scheme is the subject of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem {{ws|[[s:Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837/Antioch|Antioch]]}} (1836) in which she reflects of the superiority of trade and commerce over war and conflict. The city suffered repeated outbreaks of [[cholera]] due to inadequate infrastructure for sanitation.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}  Later the city developed and rapidly resumed much of its old importance when a railway was built along the lower Orontes Valley.\n\n===Republic of Hatay and modern Turkey===\nSee [[Hatay Province]] for the history of the region during the demise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the short-lived [[Republic of Hatay]] (in 1938), and the area's incorporation into the Republic of Turkey in 1939.\n\n==Demographics in 1935==\nIn 1935, Turkish and Arab Muslims made more than 80% of population.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Census of 1935<ref name=dump>{{cite book|last=Dumper|first=Michael|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA40|page=40}}</ref><ref name=julian>{{cite book|last=Go|first=Julian|title=Decentering Social Theory|date=2013|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781781907276|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReJbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA31&dq=1935+census}}</ref> \n|- \n!

Antakya was originally centred on the east bank of the river.  Since the 19th century, the city has expanded with new neighbourhoods built on the plains across the river to the south-west, and four bridges connect the old and new cities. Many of the buildings of the last two decades are styled as concrete blocks, and Antakya has lost much of its classic beauty.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The narrow streets of the old city can become clogged with traffic.\n\nAlthough the port city [[Iskenderun]] has become the largest city in Hatay, Antakya is a provincial capital still of considerable importance as the centre of a large district.  The draining of [[Lake Amik]] and development of land has caused the region's economy to grow in wealth and productivity. The town is a lively shopping and business centre with many restaurants, cinemas and other amenities. This district is centred on a large park opposite the governor's building and the central avenue ''Kurtulu\u015f Caddes\u0131''. The tea gardens, cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood of ''[[Harbiye, Antakya|Harbiye]]'' are popular destinations, particularly for the variety of ''[[meze]]'' in the restaurants. The [[Orontes river|Orontes]] River can be malodorous when water is low in summer. Rather than formal nightlife, in the summer heat, people will stay outside until late in the night to walk with their families and friends, and munch on snacks.\n\nIts location near the Syrian border makes Antakya more cosmopolitan than many cities in Turkey. It did not attract the mass immigration of people from eastern Anatolia in the 1980s and 1990s that radically swelled the populations of Mediterranean cities such as [[Adana]] and [[Mersin]]. Both [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic]] are still widely spoken in Antakya, although written Arabic is rarely used. A mixed community of faiths and denominations co-exist peacefully here.  Although almost all the inhabitants are [[Muslim]], a substantial proportion adhere to the [[Alevi]] and the Arab Alawi traditions, in 'Harbiye' there is a place to honour the saint [[Khidr|H\u0131z\u0131r]]. Numerous tombs of saints, of both [[Sunni]] and [[Alawite]], are located throughout the city.  Several small Christian communities are active in the city, with the largest church being St. Peter and St. Paul on Hurriyet Caddesi. With its long history of spiritual and religious movements, Antakya is a place of pilgrimage for Christians. The Jewish community of Antakya had shrunk to 14 members in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chudacoff|first1=Danya|title=Turkey's Jewish community longs for the past|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/turkey-jewish-community-antakya-20144227111824684.html|website=Aljazeera|accessdate=February 18, 2018|date=May 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>Avotaynu: the international review of Jewish genealogy, Volume 14, G.

The city is in a valley surrounded by mountains, the [[Nur Mountains]] (ancient Amanos) to the north and Mount Kelda\u011f (Jebel Akra) to the south, with the 440 m high Mount Habib-i Neccar (the ancient Mount Silpius) forming its eastern limits. The mountains are a source of a green [[marble]]. Antakya is at the northern edge of the [[Dead Sea Rift]] and vulnerable to earthquakes.\n\nThe plain of [[Amik]] to the north-east of the city is fertile soil watered by the Orontes, the [[Karasu (Hatay)|Karasu]] and the [[Afrin River|Afrin]] rivers; the lake in the plain was drained in 1980 by a French company. At the same time channels were built to widen the Orontes and let it pass neatly through the city centre. The Orontes is joined in Antakya by the Hac\u0131 K\u00fcr\u00fc\u015f stream to the north-east of the city near the church of St Peter, and the Ham\u015fen which runs down from Habib-i Neccar to the south-west, under Memekli Bridge near the army barracks. Flora includes the [[bay Laurel|bay tree]]s and [[Myrtle (plant)|myrtle]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe city enjoys a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with hot and dry summers, and mild and wet winters; however due to its higher altitude, Antakya has slightly cooler temperatures than the coast.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Antakya\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high F = 51\n|Feb high F = 57\n|Mar high F = 64\n|Apr high F = 71\n|May high F = 78\n|Jun high F = 82\n|Jul high F = 86\n|Aug high F = 87\n|Sep high F = 86\n|Oct high F = 80\n|Nov high F = 68\n|Dec high F = 55\n|year high F = 71\n|Jan low F = 39\n|Feb low F = 41\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 51\n|May low F = 59\n|Jun low F = 68\n|Jul low F = 73\n|Aug low F = 75\n|Sep low F = 68\n|Oct low F = 57\n|Nov low F = 46\n|Dec low F = 41\n|year low F = 55\n|Jan precipitation inch = 7.5\n|Feb precipitation inch = 6.5\n|Mar precipitation inch = 5.6\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.2\n|May precipitation inch = 3.2\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.3\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.3\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.1\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Nov precipitation inch = 4.3\n|Dec precipitation inch = 7.5\n|year precipitation inch = 45.1\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name=Weatherbase>{{cite web\n| url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=173702&refer=&units=us |title =Weatherbase: Weather for Antakya, Turkey | publisher=Weatherbase | year=2011 }} Retrieved on November 22, 2011.</ref>\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n\n==Education==\n[[Mustafa Kemal University]], abbreviated as MKU, has several faculties including Engineering and Medicine, while having a campus called Tayfur S\u00f6kmen located in Serinyol district {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}, north of Antakya (centrum).\nEstablished in 1992, currently more than 32,000 students enrolled at the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mku.edu.tr/main.php?page=readpage&id=980&location=oidb |publisher=MKU |title=About Mustafa Kemal University (MKU) |accessdate=2011-03-26 }}</ref>\n\nBesides the campus in Serinyol, MKU has its faculties spread out in all main districts of the province including Alt\u0131n\u00f6z\u00fc, Antakya, Belen, D\u00f6rtyol, Erzin, Hassa, \u0130skenderun, K\u0131r\u0131khan, Reyhanl\u0131, Samanda\u011f and Yaylada\u011f\u0131.\n\n==Main sights==\nThe long and varied history has created many architectural sites of interest.

It grossed over $38 million worldwide.\n\nAt the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], the film won the category of [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\nIn [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]], a con man operating under the [[sobriquet]] of \"Count [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]]\" plans to seduce a Japanese heiress named Lady Hideko, then marry her and commit her to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. He hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee to become Hideko's maid and encourage Hideko to marry him.\n\nHideko lives with her Uncle Kouzuki, a Korean man who [[Chinilpa|helped the Japanese take over his country]] in exchange for a gold mine. Kouzuki then uses this wealth to feed his obsession with rare books, selling forgeries to further accumulate money and books. Sook-hee's main job is to help Hideko prepare to read for Kouzuki's guests. Returning frustrated from a reading, Hideko demands Sook-hee sleep next to her. The two end up making love, under the pretext of preparing Hideko for her married life with the Count. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about the plan, but when Hideko herself suggests she loves someone other than the Count, Sook-hee insists on the marriage. Hideko slaps her and violently throws her from the room. \n\nWhen Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, Hideko and Fujiwara elope. After cashing out Hideko's inheritance, it is revealed that Hideko's na\u00efvet\u00e9 was part of the con. She and Fujiwara double-crossed Sook-hee and convinced the asylum that she is the \"Countess\" to have her committed in Hideko's stead.\n\n===Part 2===\nA series of flashbacks show that Hideko's \u201creading practice\u201d was in fact Kouzuki teaching her to erotically read sadistic pornography since she was five years old. The flashbacks show a regime of psychological and physical abuse that eventually degrades Hideko's aunt's sanity. Hideko's aunt is eventually found hanged from a tree in the yard, and Hideko takes over as the reader for the pornography auctions. When Hideko questions the description of a hanging in a book she has to read, Kouzuki tells her that he murdered her aunt using torture devices in the basement after she attempted to run away.\n\nIn the more recent past, the Count realizes seducing Hideko would be impossible and instead includes her in the plan to elope and then split her inheritance. When Hideko expresses her fear of her uncle, the Count promises her a vial of fast-acting poison as a wedding present, so that she can never be taken to the basement. Hideko demands the Count find her a girl to hire as a maid, to commit to an asylum in Hideko's place.\n\nWhile being instructed by the Count, who takes advantage of Sook-hee's illiteracy, Hideko unexpectedly falls in love with her. Hideko tries to confess her love, but when Sook-hee insists the marriage go on, Hideko throws her from the room and tries to hang herself. Sook-hee saves her and both admit to their plots. Hideko helps Sook-hee write a letter to her family to say she has teamed up with Hideko, and to hatch a plot to get Hideko and Sook-hee away from the men who have been manipulating them. Hideko shows Sook-hee the books she was forced to read and Sook-hee begins destroying the library. Hideko calls Sook-hee \"her savior\" and joins in destroying her uncle's collection.\n\n===Part 3===\nSook-hee's friend Bok-soon sets a fire at the asylum and poses as a firefighter to rescue Sook-hee. Hideko poisons Fujiwara's wine, causing him to pass out while she takes the money and leaves. The women reunite and flee together, disguising Hideko as a man to avoid detection.\n\nKouzuki captures Fujiwara upon receiving a letter from Hideko detailing Fujiwara's deception. He tortures Fujiwara in his cellar with his collection of antique bookmaking tools and presses him for sexual details about his niece. Fujiwara makes up a story about their wedding night but a flashback shows that he watched Hideko masturbate before cutting her hand on a knife to stain her sheets, refusing to consummate the marriage. When Kouzuki presses for more details, Fujiwara convinces him to give him one of his cigarettes. After smoking, a disgusted Fujiwara refuses to give further details. Kouzuki notices the cigarettes are producing blue smoke. Fujiwara reveals that his cigarettes had been laced with mercury and the toxic gas within the smoke kills them both.\n\nOn a ferry to [[Shanghai, China]], Sook-hee and Hideko celebrate their newfound freedom by making love once again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kim Min-hee (actress, born 1982)|Kim Min-hee]] as Lady/Izumi Hideko\n* [[Kim Tae-ri]] as Maid/Nam Sook-hee\n* [[Ha Jung-woo]] as Count

It is inspired by the novel ''[[Fingersmith (novel)|Fingersmith]]'' by Welsh writer [[Sarah Waters]], with the setting changed from [[Victorian era]] Britain to [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea under Japanese colonial rule]].\n\nThe film was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was released in South Korea on 1 June 2016, to critical acclaim. It grossed over $38 million worldwide.\n\nAt the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], the film won the category of [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\nIn [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]], a con man operating under the [[sobriquet]] of \"Count [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]]\" plans to seduce a Japanese heiress named Lady Hideko, then marry her and commit her to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. He hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee to become Hideko's maid and encourage Hideko to marry him.\n\nHideko lives with her Uncle Kouzuki, a Korean man who [[Chinilpa|helped the Japanese take over his country]] in exchange for a gold mine. Kouzuki then uses this wealth to feed his obsession with rare books, selling forgeries to further accumulate money and books. Sook-hee\u2019s main job is to help Hideko prepare to read for Kouzuki\u2019s guests. Returning frustrated from a reading, Hideko demands Sook-hee sleep next to her. The two end up making love, under the pretext of preparing Hideko for her married life with the Count. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about the plan, but when Hideko herself suggests she loves someone other than the Count, Sook-hee insists on the marriage. Hideko slaps her and violently throws her from the room. \n\nWhen Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, Hideko and Fujiwara elope. After cashing out Hideko's inheritance, it is revealed that Hideko\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 was part of the con. She and Fujiwara double-crossed Sook-hee and convinced the asylum that she is the \"Countess\" to have her committed in Hideko's stead.\n\n===Part 2===\nA series of flashbacks show that Hideko\u2019s \u201creading practice\u201d was in fact Kouzuki teaching her to erotically read sadistic pornography since she was five years old. The flashbacks show a regime of psychological and physical abuse that eventually degrades Hideko\u2019s aunt\u2019s sanity. Hideko's aunt is eventually found hanged from a tree in the yard, and Hideko takes over as the reader for the pornography auctions. When Hideko questions the description of a hanging in a book she has to read, Kouzuki tells her that he murdered her aunt using torture devices in the basement after she attempted to run away.\n\nIn the more recent past, the Count realizes seducing Hideko would be impossible and instead includes her in the plan to elope and then split her inheritance. When Hideko expresses her fear of her uncle, the Count promises her a vial of fast-acting poison as a wedding present, so that she can never be taken to the basement. Hideko demands the Count find her a girl to hire as a maid, to commit to an asylum in Hideko\u2019s place.\n\nWhile being instructed by the Count, who takes advantage of Sook-hee's illiteracy, Hideko unexpectedly falls in love with her. Hideko tries to confess her love, but when Sook-hee insists the marriage go on, Hideko throws her from the room and tries to hang herself. Sook-hee saves her and both admit to their plots. Hideko helps Sook-hee write a letter to her family to say she has teamed up with Hideko, and to hatch a plot to get Hideko and Sook-hee away from the men who have been manipulating them. Hideko shows Sook-hee the books she was forced to read and Sook-hee begins destroying the library. Hideko calls Sook-hee \"her savior\" and joins in destroying her uncle\u2019s collection.\n\n===Part 3===\nSook-hee's friend Bok-soon sets a fire at the asylum and poses as a firefighter to rescue Sook-hee. Hideko poisons Fujiwara's wine, causing him to pass out while she takes the money and leaves. The women reunite and flee together, disguising Hideko as a man to avoid detection.\n\nKouzuki captures Fujiwara upon receiving a letter from Hideko detailing Fujiwara's deception. He tortures Fujiwara in his cellar with his collection of antique bookmaking tools and presses him for sexual details about his niece. Fujiwara makes up a story about their wedding night but a flashback shows that he watched Hideko masturbate before cutting her hand on a knife to stain her sheets, refusing to consummate the marriage. When Kouzuki presses for more details, Fujiwara convinces him to give him one of his cigarettes. After smoking, a disgusted Fujiwara refuses to give further details. Kouzuki notices the cigarettes are producing blue smoke. Fujiwara reveals that his cigarettes had been laced with mercury and the toxic gas within the smoke kills them both.\n\nOn a ferry to [[Shanghai, China]], Sook-hee and Hideko celebrate their newfound freedom by making love once again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kim Min-hee (actress, born 1982)|Kim Min-hee]] as Lady/Izumi Hideko\n* [[Kim Tae-ri]] as Maid/Nam Sook-hee\n* [[Ha Jung-woo]] as Count
