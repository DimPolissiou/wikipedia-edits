{"title_page": "Magnetic moment", "text_new": "{{short description|Physical quantity; measured in ampere square metre}}\n{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Magnetostatics}}\n\nThe '''magnetic moment''' is the magnetic strength and orientation of a [[magnet]] or other object that produces a [[magnetic field]]. Examples of objects that have magnetic moments include: loops of [[electric current]] (such as [[electromagnet]]s), permanent magnets, moving elementary particles (such as [[electron]]s), various [[molecule]]s, and many astronomical objects (such as many [[planet]]s, some [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s, etc).\n\nMore precisely, the term ''magnetic moment'' normally refers to a system's '''magnetic dipole moment''', the component of the magnetic moment that can be represented by an equivalent [[magnetic dipole]]: a magnetic north and south pole separated by a very small distance. The magnetic dipole component is sufficient for small enough magnets or for large enough distances. Higher order terms (such as the [[quadrupole moment|magnetic quadrupole moment]]) may be needed in addition to the dipole moment for extended objects.\n\nThe magnetic dipole moment of an object is readily defined in terms of the torque that object experiences in a given magnetic field. The same applied magnetic field creates larger torques on objects with larger magnetic moments. The strength (and direction) of this torque depends not only on the magnitude of the magnetic moment but also on its orientation relative to the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic moment may be considered, therefore, to be a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of the magnet (inside the magnet).\n\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is proportional to its magnetic dipole moment. The dipole component of an object's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.\n\n== Definition, units, and measurement ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nThe magnetic moment can be defined as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] relating the aligning [[torque]] on the object from an externally applied [[magnetic field]] to the field vector itself. The relationship is given by:<ref name=Graham>\n{{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |first1=B. D.|last1= Cullity|first2= C. D.|last2= Graham |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ixAe4qIGEmwC&pg=PA103 |page=103 |isbn=978-0-471-47741-9 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Wiley-IEEE Press]]|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n: <math> \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{m} \\times\\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''''\u03c4'''''}} is the torque acting on the dipole, {{math|'''B'''}} is the external magnetic field, and {{math|'''m'''}} is the magnetic moment.\n\nThis definition is based on how one could, in principle, measure the magnetic moment of an unknown sample. For a current loop, this definition leads to the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment equaling the product of the current times the area of the loop. Further, this definition allows the calculation of the expected magnetic moment for any known macroscopic current distribution.\n\nAn alternative definition is useful for [[thermodynamics]] calculations of the magnetic moment. In this definition, the magnetic dipole moment of a system is the negative gradient of its intrinsic energy, {{math|''U''<sub>int</sub>}}, with respect to external magnetic field:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{m} = -\\hat\\mathbf x\\frac{\\partial U_{\\rm int}}{\\partial B_x}-\\hat\\mathbf y\\frac{\\partial U_{\\rm int}}{\\partial B_y} -\\hat\\mathbf z\\frac{\\partial U_{\\rm int}}{\\partial B_z}.</math>\n\nGenerically, the intrinsic energy includes the self-field energy of the system plus the energy of the internal workings of the system. For example, for a hydrogen atom in a 2p state in an external field, the self-field energy is negligible, so the internal energy is essentially the eigenenergy of the 2p state, which includes Coulomb potential energy and the kinetic energy of the electron. The interaction-field energy between the internal dipoles and external fields is not part of this internal energy.<ref>See, for example, {{cite book |title=Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics |first1=Herbert B.|last1= Callen|page=200 |isbn=978-0-471-86256-7 |year=1985 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|edition=2nd}} where the relevant {{math|U}} is {{math|U[B{{sub|e}}]}}.</ref>\n\n=== Units ===\nThe unit for magnetic moment in [[International System of Units]] (SI) [[SI base unit|base units]] is A\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>, where A is [[ampere]] (SI base unit of current) and m is [[meter]] (SI base unit of distance). This unit has equivalents in other SI derived units including:<ref name=IEEEM>{{cite web|title=Magnetic units|url=http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118&Itemid=107|publisher=IEEE Magnetics|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Peter J. |last1=Mohr |first2=David B. |last2=Newell |first3=Barry N. |last3=Taylor |author-link= |arxiv=1507.07956 |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2014 |date=21 Jul 2015 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035009 |volume=88 |issue=3 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |bibcode=2016RvMP...88c5009M}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\text{A} {\\cdot} \\text{m}^{2} = \\frac{\\text{N} {\\cdot} \\text{m}}{\\text{T}} = \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{T}},</math>\n\nwhere N is [[newton (unit)|newton]] (SI derived unit of force), T is [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] (SI derived unit of magnetic flux density), and J is [[joule]] (SI derived unit of [[energy]]).<ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, pp. 20-21</ref> Although torque (N\u00b7m) and energy (J) are dimensionally equivalent, torques are never expressed in units of energy.<ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 23</ref>\n\nIn the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] system, there are several different sets of electromagnetism units, of which the main ones are [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electrostatic units (ESU)|ESU]], [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], and [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|EMU]]. Among these, there are two alternative (non-equivalent) units of magnetic dipole moment:\n:<math>1 \\text{ statA} {\\cdot} \\text{cm}^2 = 3.33564095 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ A} {\\cdot} \\text{m}^2</math> (ESU)\n:<math>1 \\;\\frac{\\text{erg}}{\\text{G}} = 10^{-3} \\text{ A} {\\cdot} \\text{m}^2</math> (Gaussian and EMU),\n\nwhere statA is [[statampere]]s, cm is [[centimeter]]s, erg is [[erg]]s, and G is [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]. The ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal to the [[speed of light|speed of light in free space]], expressed in [[Centimetre|cm]]\u22c5[[Second|s]]<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nAll formulae in this article are correct in [[SI]] units; they may need to be changed for use in other unit systems. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current {{mvar|I}} and area {{mvar|A}} has magnetic moment {{mvar|IA}} (see below), but in [[Gaussian units]] the magnetic moment is {{math|{{sfrac|''IA''|[[speed of light|''c'']]}}}}.\n\nOther units for measuring the magnetic dipole moment include the [[Bohr magneton]] and the [[nuclear magneton]].\n\n=== Measurement ===\n{{main|magnetometer}}\n\nThe magnetic moments of objects are typically measured with devices called [[magnetometer]]s. Not all magnetometers measure magnetic moment though. Some are configured to measure [[magnetic field]] instead. If the magnetic field surrounding an object is known well enough, though, then the magnetic moment can be calculated from that magnetic field.\n\n== Relation to magnetization ==\n{{main|Magnetization}}\n{{see also|Remanence}}\n\nThe magnetic moment is a quantity that describes the magnetic strength of an entire object. Sometimes, though, it is useful or necessary to know how much of the net magnetic moment of the object is produced by a particular portion of that magnet. Therefore, it is useful to define the magnetization field <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{M} = \\frac{\\mathbf{m}_{\\Delta V}}{V_{\\Delta V}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{m}_{\\Delta V}</math> and <math>V_{\\Delta V}</math> are the magnetic dipole moment and volume of a sufficiently small portion of the magnet <math>\\Delta V</math>. This equation is often represented using derivative notation such that\n\n:<math>\\mathbf M=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf m}{\\mathrm{d}V},</math>\n\nwhere ''d'''''m''' is the elementary magnetic moment and ''dV'' is the [[volume element]]. The net magnetic moment of the magnet <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> therefore is\n:<math>\\mathbf m = \\iiint \\mathbf M\\,\\mathrm{d}V,</math>\n\nwhere the triple integral denotes integration over the volume of the [[Magnetic field|magnet]]. For uniform magnetization (where both the magnitude and the direction of <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> is the same for the entire magnet (such as a straight bar magnet) the last equation simplifies to:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{m} = \\mathbf{M} V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the volume of the bar magnet.\n\nThe magnetization is often not listed as a material parameter for commercially available [[ferromagnetic]] materials, though. Instead the parameter that is listed is [[residual flux density]] (or remanence), denoted  <math> \\textstyle \\mathbf{B}_r</math>. The formula needed in this case to calculate <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> in (units of A\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>) is:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{m} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\mathbf{B}_r V</math>,\n\nwhere:\n* <math> \\textstyle \\mathbf{B}_r</math> is the residual flux density, expressed in [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]].\n* <math> \\textstyle V</math> is the volume (m<sup>3</sup>) of the magnet.\n* <math> \\textstyle \\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ H/m}</math> is the permeability of vacuum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kjmagnetics.com/glossary.asp|title=K&J Magnetics \u2013 Glossary|author=|date=|website=www.kjmagnetics.com}}</ref>\n\n== Models ==\nThe preferred classical explanation of a magnetic moment has changed over time. Before the 1930s, textbooks explained the moment using hypothetical magnetic point charges. Since then, most have defined it in terms of Amp\u00e8rian currents.<ref name=Brown62>{{cite book|last=Brown|first = William Fuller, Jr.|author-link = William Fuller Brown, Jr.|title = Magnetostatic Principles in Ferromagnetism|year=1962 |publisher = [[North-Holland]]}}</ref> In magnetic materials, the cause of the magnetic moment are the [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic moment and angular momentum|spin and orbital angular momentum states]] of the [[Electron|electrons]], and varies depending on whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another.\n\n=== Magnetic pole model ===\n[[File:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|upright|An electrostatic analog for a magnetic moment: two opposing charges separated by a finite distance.]]\nThe sources of magnetic moments in materials can be represented by poles in analogy to [[electrostatics]].

Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since [[magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles]] always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels. This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors: the strength {{mvar|p}} of its poles (''magnetic pole strength''), and the vector {{mvar|'''l'''}} separating them. The magnetic dipole moment {{mvar|'''m'''}} is related to the fictitious poles as<ref name=\"Brown62\" />\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{m}=p\\boldsymbol{l}.</math>\n\nIt points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with [[angular momentum]] (see [[#Relation to angular momentum|Relation to angular momentum]]). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for [[Magnetostatics|magnetostatic]] calculations, particularly in applications to [[ferromagnets]].<ref name=Brown62/> Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the [[magnetic field]] by the [[irrotational]] field {{math|'''H'''}}, in analogy to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}.\n\n=== Amperian loop model ===\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines). The north pole is to the right and the south to the left.]]\n\nAfter [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] discovered that [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|electric currents attract]] and repel each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Amp\u00e8re, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{m}=I\\boldsymbol{S},</math>\n \nwhere {{math|''S''}} is the area of the loop.

Conventionally, the derivation starts from a [[multipole expansion]] of the [[Magnetic vector potential|vector potential]].

While this relation is straight forward to develop for macroscopic currents using the amperian loop model (see [[#Magnetic moment and angular momentum|below]]), neither the magnetic pole model nor the amperian loop model truly represents what is occurring at the atomic and molecular levels. At that level [[quantum mechanics]] must be used. Fortunately, the linear relationship between the magnetic dipole moment of a particle and its angular momentum still holds; although it is different for each particle. Further, care must be used to distinguish between the intrinsic angular momentum (or [[spin (physics)|spin]]) of the particle and the particle's orbital angular momentum. See [[#Magnetic moment of an atom|below]] for more details.\n\n== Effects of an external magnetic field ==\n\n=== Torque on a moment ===\n\nThe torque <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}</math> on an object having a magnetic dipole moment <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> in a uniform magnetic field <math>\\mathbf{B}</math> is:\n\n: <math> \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{m} \\times\\mathbf{B}</math>.\n\nThis is valid for the moment due to any localized current distribution provided that the magnetic field is uniform. For non-uniform B the equation is also valid for the torque about the center of the magnetic dipole provided that the magnetic dipole is small enough.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |first1=David J. |last1=Griffiths |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/257 257] |isbn=978-0138053260 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |edition=3rd |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/257 }}</ref>\n\nAn electron, nucleus, or atom placed in a uniform magnetic field will precess with a frequency known as the [[Larmor frequency]].

This phenomenon is known as [[magnetism]]. An applied magnetic field can flip the magnetic dipoles that make up the material causing both [[paramagnetism]] and [[ferromagnetism]]. Additionally, the magnetic field can affect the currents that create the magnetic fields (such as the atomic orbits) which causes [[diamagnetism]].\n\n== Effects on environment ==\n\n=== Magnetic field of a magnetic moment ===\n{{Main|Magnetic dipole}}\n{{See also|Dipole}}\n[[File:Magnetic dipole moment.jpg|thumbnail|right|Magnetic field lines around a \"magnetostatic dipole\". The magnetic dipole itself is located in the center of the figure, seen from the side, and pointing upward.]]\nAny system possessing a net magnetic dipole moment {{math|'''m'''}} will produce a [[dipole|dipolar]] magnetic field (described below) in the space surrounding the system. While the net magnetic field produced by the system can also have higher-order [[multipole]] components, those will drop off with distance more rapidly, so that only the dipole component will dominate the magnetic field of the system at distances far away from it.\n\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole depends on the strength and direction of a magnet's magnetic moment <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> but drops off as the cube of the distance such that:\n\n:<math>{\\mathbf{H}}({\\mathbf{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(\\frac{3\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf r|^5}-\\frac{{\\mathbf{m}}}{|\\mathbf r|^3}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> is the [[magnetic field]] produced by the magnet and <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> is a vector from the center of the magnetic dipole to the location where the magnetic field is measured.

The first three terms of that series are called the [[Multipole expansion|monopole]] (represented by an isolated magnetic north or south pole) the [[Magnetic dipole|dipole]] (represented by two equal and opposite magnetic poles), and the [[Quadrupole#Magnetic quadrupole|quadrupole]] (represented by four poles that together form two equal and opposite dipoles). The magnitude of the magnetic field for each term decreases progressively faster with distance than the previous term, so that at large enough distances the first non-zero term will dominate.\n\nFor many magnets the first non-zero term is the magnetic dipole moment. (To date, no isolated [[magnetic monopole]]s have been experimentally detected.) A magnetic dipole is the limit of either a current loop or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the moment constant. As long as these limits only apply to fields far from the sources, they are equivalent. However, the two models give different predictions for the internal field (see below).\n\n=== Magnetic potentials ===\n{{Main|Magnetic potential}}\n\nTraditionally, the equations for the magnetic dipole moment (and higher order terms) are derived from theoretical quantities called [[Magnetic vector potential|magnetic potential]]s<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd|section=5.6|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0}}</ref> which are simpler to deal with mathematically then the magnetic fields.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, the relevant magnetic field is the [[demagnetizing field]] <math>\\mathbf{H}</math>. Since the demagnetizing portion of <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> does not include, by definition, the part of <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> due to free currents, there exists a [[magnetic scalar potential]] such that\n\n:<math>{\\mathbf{H}}({\\mathbf{r}})=-\\nabla\\psi</math>.\n\nIn the amperian loop model, the relevant magnetic field is the magnetic induction <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>. Since magnetic monopoles do not exist, there exists a [[magnetic vector potential]] such that\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}({\\mathbf{r}})=\\nabla\\times{\\mathbf{A}}.</math>\n\nBoth of these potentials can be calculated for any arbitrary current distribution (for the amperian loop model) or magnetic charge distribution (for the magnetic charge model) provided that these are limited to a small enough region to give:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{A} \\left(\\mathbf{r}, t\\right) &= \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\mathbf{j}\\left(\\mathbf{r}'\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\, \\mathrm{d}V', \\\\\n        \\psi \\left(\\mathbf{r}, t\\right) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\mathbf{r}'\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\, \\mathrm{d}V',\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is the [[current density]] in the amperian loop model, <math>\\rho</math> is the magnetic pole strength density in analogy to the electric [[charge density]] that leads to the electric potential, and the integrals are the volume (triple) integrals over the coordinates that make up <math>\\mathbf{r}'</math>. The denominators of these equation can be expanded using the [[multipole expansion]] to give a series of terms that have larger of power of distances in the denominator. The first nonzero term, therefore, will dominate for large distances. The first non-zero term for the vector potential is:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf r)=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{\\mathbf m\\times\\mathbf r}{|\\mathbf r|^3},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> is:\n \n: <math>\\mathbf{m}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\iiint_V \\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{j}\\,{\\rm d}V,</math>\n\nwhere \u00d7 is the [[vector cross product]], {{math|'''r'''}} is the position vector, and {{math|'''j'''}} is the [[electric current density]] and the integral is a volume integral.\n\nIn the magnetic pole perspective, the first non-zero term of the [[Magnetic scalar potential|scalar potential]] is\n\n:<math>\\psi(\\mathbf r)=\\frac{\\mathbf m\\cdot\\mathbf r}{4\\pi|\\mathbf r|^3}.</math>\n\nHere <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> may be represented in terms of the magnetic pole strength density but is more usefully expressed in terms of the [[magnetization]] field as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf m=\\iiint \\mathbf M\\,\\mathrm{d}V.</math>\n\nThe same symbol <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> is used for both equations since they produce equivalent results outside of the magnet.\n\n=== External magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole moment ===\n\nThe [[magnetic flux density]] for a magnetic dipole in the amperian loop model, therefore, is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}({\\mathbf{r}})=\\nabla\\times{\\mathbf{A}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\left(\\frac{3\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf r|^5}-\\frac{{\\mathbf{m}}}{|\\mathbf r|^3}\\right).</math>\n\nFurther, the [[magnetic field strength]] <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> is\n:<math>{\\mathbf{H}}({\\mathbf{r}})=-\\nabla\\psi=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(\\frac{3\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf r|^5}-\\frac{{\\mathbf{m}}}{|\\mathbf r|^3}\\right).</math>\n\n=== Internal magnetic field of a dipole ===\n[[File:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|right|The magnetic field of a current loop]]\nThe two models for a dipole (current loop and magnetic poles) give the same predictions for the magnetic field far from the source. However, inside the source region, they give different predictions. The magnetic field between poles (see figure for [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic pole representation|Magnetic pole definition]]) is in the opposite direction to the magnetic moment (which points from the negative charge to the positive charge), while inside a current loop it is in the same direction (see the figure to the right). The limits of these fields must also be different as the sources shrink to zero size. This distinction only matters if the dipole limit is used to calculate fields inside a magnetic material.<ref name=Brown62/>\n\nIf a magnetic dipole is formed by making a current loop smaller and smaller, but keeping the product of current and area constant, the limiting field is\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\left[\\frac{3\\mathbf\\hat{r}(\\mathbf\\hat{r}\\cdot \\mathbf{m})-\\mathbf{m}}{|\\mathbf{r}|^3} + \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\mathbf{m}\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\right].</math>\nUnlike the expressions in the previous section, this limit is correct for the internal field of the dipole.<ref name=Brown62/><ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|year=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-43132-9|edition=2nd|page=[https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0/page/184 184]|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0/page/184}}</ref>\n\nIf a magnetic dipole is formed by taking a \"north pole\" and a \"south pole\", bringing them closer and closer together but keeping the product of magnetic pole charge and distance constant, the limiting field is<ref name=Brown62/>\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{r}) =\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left[\\frac{3\\mathbf\\hat{r}(\\mathbf\\hat{r}\\cdot \\mathbf{m})-\\mathbf{m}}{|\\mathbf{r}|^3} - \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\mathbf{m}\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\right].</math>\n\nThese fields are related by {{math|'''B''' {{=}} ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>('''H''' + '''M''')}}, where {{math|'''M'''('''r''') {{=}} '''m'''''\u03b4''('''r''')}} is the [[magnetization]].\n\n== Relation to angular momentum ==\n{{see also|gyromagnetic ratio}}\nThe magnetic moment has a close connection with [[angular momentum]] called the ''gyromagnetic effect''. This effect is expressed on a [[macroscopic scale]] in the [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]], or \"rotation by magnetization,\" and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]], or \"magnetization by rotation.\"<ref name=Graham/> Further, a [[torque]] applied to a relatively isolated magnetic dipole such as an [[atomic nucleus]] can cause it to [[precession|precess]] (rotate about the axis of the applied field). This phenomenon is used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].\n\nViewing a magnetic dipole as current loop brings out the close connection between magnetic moment and angular momentum. Since the particles creating the current (by rotating around the loop) have charge and mass, both the magnetic moment and the angular momentum increase with the rate of rotation. The ratio of the two is called the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] or <math>\\gamma</math> so that:<ref name=Krey>{{cite book |title=Basic Theoretical Physics |first= Uwe|last1= Krey|first2= Anthony|last2= Owen |pages=151\u2013152 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZ_QelBmkxYC&pg=PA151 |isbn=978-3-540-36804-5 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}</ref><ref name=Buxton>{{cite book |first=Richard B.|last= Buxton |title=Introduction to functional magnetic resonance imaging |page=136 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6XVu0NKzgekC&pg=PA136 |isbn=978-0-521-58113-4 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{m} = \\gamma\\mathbf{L},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{L}</math> is the angular momentum of the particle or particles that are creating the magnetic moment.\n\nIn the amperian loop model, which applies for macroscopic currents, the gyromagnetic ratio is one half of the [[charge-to-mass ratio]]. This can be shown as follows. The angular momentum of a moving charged particle is defined as:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p} = \\mu \\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{v},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the mass of the particle and {{mvar|'''v'''}} is the particle's [[velocity]]. The angular momentum of the very large number of charged particles that make up a current therefore is:\n: <math> \\mathbf{L}=\\iiint_V \\mathbf{r}\\times(\\rho \\mathbf{v})\\,{\\rm d}V,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the [[mass density]] of the moving particles.

For example the ''g''-factor for the magnetic moment due to an electron orbiting a nucleus is one while the ''g''-factor for the magnetic moment of electron due to its intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) is a little larger than 2. The ''g''-factor of atoms and molecules must account for the orbital and intrinsic moments of its electrons and possibly the intrinsic moment of its nuclei as well.\n\nIn the atomic world the angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of a particle is an [[integer]] (or [[half-integer]] in the case of spin) multiple of the reduced [[Planck constant]] {{mvar|\u0127}}. This is the basis for defining the magnetic moment units of [[Bohr magneton]] (assuming [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of the [[electron]]) and [[nuclear magneton]] (assuming [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of the [[proton]]). See [[electron magnetic moment]] and [[Bohr magneton]] for more details.\n\n== Atoms, molecules, and elementary particles ==\n\nFundamentally, contributions to any system's magnetic moment may come from sources of two kinds: motion of [[electric charge]]s, such as [[electric current]]s; and the [[Spin (physics)#Magnetic moments|intrinsic magnetism]] of [[elementary particle]]s, such as the [[electron]].\n\nContributions due to the sources of the first kind can be calculated from knowing the distribution of all the electric currents (or, alternatively, of all the electric charges and their velocities) inside the system, by using the formulas below. On the other hand, the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of each elementary particle's intrinsic magnetic moment is a fixed number, often measured experimentally to a great precision. For example, any electron's magnetic moment is measured to be {{val|-9.284764|e=-24|u=J/T}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?muem|title=CODATA Value: electron magnetic moment|website=physics.nist.gov}}</ref> The [[Euclidean vector|direction]] of the magnetic moment of any elementary particle is entirely determined by the direction of its [[spin (physics)|spin]], with the [[minus sign|negative value]] indicating that any electron's magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin.\n\nThe net magnetic moment of any system is a [[Euclidean vector|vector sum]] of contributions from one or both types of sources.\nFor example, the magnetic moment of an atom of [[Hydrogen atom|hydrogen-1]] (the lightest hydrogen isotope, consisting of a proton and an electron) is a vector sum of the following contributions:\n\n# the intrinsic moment of the electron,\n# the orbital motion of the electron around the proton,\n# the intrinsic moment of the proton.\n\nSimilarly, the magnetic moment of a [[bar magnet]] is the sum of the contributing magnetic moments, which include the intrinsic and orbital magnetic moments of the unpaired [[electron]]s of the magnet's material and the nuclear magnetic moments.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of an atom ===\nFor an atom, individual electron spins are added to get a total spin, and individual orbital angular momenta are added to get a total orbital angular momentum.

The first term describes precession of the moment about the effective field, while the second is a damping term related to dissipation of energy caused by interaction with the surroundings.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of an electron ===\n{{see also|Anomalous magnetic dipole moment}}\n[[Electron]]s and many elementary particles also have intrinsic [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moments]], an explanation of which requires a quantum mechanical treatment and relates to the intrinsic [[angular momentum]] of the particles as discussed in the article [[Electron magnetic moment]]. It is these intrinsic magnetic moments that give rise to the macroscopic effects of [[magnetism]], and other phenomena, such as [[electron paramagnetic resonance]].\n\nThe magnetic moment of the electron is\n: <math> \\mathbf{m}_\\text{S} = -\\frac{g_S \\mu_\\text{B} \\mathbf{S}}{\\hbar},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>B</sub>}} is the [[Bohr magneton]], {{math|'''S'''}} is electron [[spin (physics)|spin]], and the [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] {{mvar|g<sub>S</sub>}} is 2 according to [[Dirac equation|Dirac]]'s theory, but due to [[quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamic]] effects it is slightly larger in reality: {{val|2.00231930436}}. The deviation from 2 is known as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]].\n\nAgain it is important to notice that {{math|'''m'''}} is a negative constant multiplied by the [[spin (physics)|spin]], so the magnetic moment of the electron is antiparallel to the spin. This can be understood with the following classical picture: if we imagine that the spin angular momentum is created by the electron mass spinning around some axis, the electric current that this rotation creates circulates in the opposite direction, because of the negative charge of the electron; such current loops produce a magnetic moment which is antiparallel to the spin. Hence, for a positron (the anti-particle of the electron) the magnetic moment is parallel to its spin.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of a nucleus ===\n{{See also|Nuclear magnetic moment}}\nThe nuclear system is a complex physical system consisting of nucleons, i.e., [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. The quantum mechanical properties of the nucleons include the spin among others. Since the electromagnetic moments of the nucleus depend on the spin of the individual nucleons, one can look at these properties with measurements of nuclear moments, and more specifically the nuclear magnetic dipole moment.\n\nMost common nuclei exist in their [[ground state]], although nuclei of some [[isotope]]s have long-lived [[excited state]]s. Each [[energy state]] of a nucleus of a given isotope is characterized by a well-defined magnetic dipole moment, the magnitude of which is a fixed number, often measured experimentally to a great precision. This number is very sensitive to the individual contributions from nucleons, and a measurement or prediction of its value can reveal important information about the content of the nuclear wave function. There are several theoretical models that predict the value of the magnetic dipole moment and a number of experimental techniques aiming to carry out measurements in nuclei along the nuclear chart.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of a molecule ===\nAny molecule has a well-defined magnitude of magnetic moment, which may depend on the molecule's [[energy state]]. Typically, the overall magnetic moment of a molecule is a combination of the following contributions, in the order of their typical strength:\n* magnetic moments due to its unpaired [[electron spin]]s ([[paramagnetic]] contribution), if any\n* orbital motion of its electrons, which in the [[Stationary state#Ground state|ground state]] is often proportional to the external magnetic field ([[diamagnetic]] contribution)\n* the combined magnetic moment of its [[nuclear spin]]s, which depends on the [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-spin coupling|nuclear spin configuration]].\n\n==== Examples of molecular magnetism ====\n* The [[Oxygen|dioxygen]] molecule, O<sub>2</sub>, exhibits strong [[paramagnetism]], due to unpaired spins of its outermost two electrons.\n* The [[carbon dioxide]] molecule, CO<sub>2</sub>, mostly exhibits [[diamagnetism]], a much weaker magnetic moment of the electron [[Molecular orbital|orbitals]] that is proportional to the external magnetic field. The nuclear magnetism of a magnetic [[isotope]] such as <sup>13</sup>C or <sup>17</sup>O will contribute to the molecule's magnetic moment.\n* The [[dihydrogen]] molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, in a weak (or zero) magnetic field exhibits nuclear magnetism, and can be in a [[parahydrogen|para-]] or an [[orthohydrogen|ortho-]] nuclear spin configuration.\n* Many transition metal complexes are magnetic. The spin-only formula is a good first approximation for high-spin complexes of first-row [[transition metal]]s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last2=Lewis |first2=J. |last1=Figgis |first1=B.

Examples of objects that have magnetic moments include: loops of [[electric current]] (such as [[electromagnet]]s), permanent magnets, moving elementary particles (such as [[electron]]s), various [[molecule]]s, and many astronomical objects (such as many [[planet]]s, some [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s, etc).\n\nMore precisely, the term ''magnetic moment'' normally refers to a system's '''magnetic dipole moment''', the component of the magnetic moment that can be represented by an equivalent [[magnetic dipole]]: a magnetic north and south pole separated by a very small distance. The magnetic dipole component is sufficient for small enough magnets or for large enough distances. Higher order terms (such as the [[quadrupole moment|magnetic quadrupole moment]]) may be needed in addition to the dipole moment for extended objects.\n\nThe magnetic dipole moment of an object is readily defined in terms of the torque that object experiences in a given magnetic field. The same applied magnetic field creates larger torques on objects with larger magnetic moments. The strength (and direction) of this torque depends not only on the magnitude of the magnetic moment but also on its orientation relative to the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic moment may be considered, therefore, to be a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of the magnet (inside the magnet).\n\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is proportional to its magnetic dipole moment. The dipole component of an object's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.\n\n== Definition, units, and measurement ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nThe magnetic moment can be defined as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] relating the aligning [[torque]] on the object from an externally applied [[magnetic field]] to the field vector itself. The relationship is given by:<ref name=Graham>\n{{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |first1=B. D.|last1= Cullity|first2= C. D.|last2= Graham |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ixAe4qIGEmwC&pg=PA103 |page=103 |isbn=978-0-471-47741-9 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Wiley-IEEE Press]]|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n: <math> \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{m} \\times\\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''''\u03c4'''''}} is the torque acting on the dipole, {{math|'''B'''}} is the external magnetic field, and {{math|'''m'''}} is the magnetic moment.\n\nThis definition is based on how one could, in principle, measure the magnetic moment of an unknown sample. For a current loop, this definition leads to the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment equaling the product of the current times the area of the loop. Further, this definition allows the calculation of the expected magnetic moment for any known macroscopic current distribution.\n\nAn alternative definition is useful for [[thermodynamics]] calculations of the magnetic moment. In this definition, the magnetic dipole moment of a system is the negative gradient of its intrinsic energy, {{math|''U''<sub>int</sub>}}, with respect to external magnetic field:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{m} = -\\hat\\mathbf x\\frac{\\partial U_{\\rm int}}{\\partial B_x}-\\hat\\mathbf y\\frac{\\partial U_{\\rm int}}{\\partial B_y} -\\hat\\mathbf z\\frac{\\partial U_{\\rm int}}{\\partial B_z}.</math>\n\nGenerically, the intrinsic energy includes the self-field energy of the system plus the energy of the internal workings of the system. For example, for a hydrogen atom in a 2p state in an external field, the self-field energy is negligible, so the internal energy is essentially the eigenenergy of the 2p state, which includes Coulomb potential energy and the kinetic energy of the electron. The interaction-field energy between the internal dipoles and external fields is not part of this internal energy.<ref>See, for example, {{cite book |title=Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics |first1=Herbert B.|last1= Callen|page=200 |isbn=978-0-471-86256-7 |year=1985 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|edition=2nd}} where the relevant {{math|U}} is {{math|U[B{{sub|e}}]}}.</ref>\n\n=== Units ===\nThe unit for magnetic moment in [[International System of Units]] (SI) [[SI base unit|base units]] is A\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>, where A is [[ampere]] (SI base unit of current) and m is [[meter]] (SI base unit of distance).

Among these, there are two alternative (non-equivalent) units of magnetic dipole moment:\n:<math>1 \\text{ statA} {\\cdot} \\text{cm}^2 = 3.33564095 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ A} {\\cdot} \\text{m}^2</math> (ESU)\n:<math>1 \\;\\frac{\\text{erg}}{\\text{G}} = 10^{-3} \\text{ A} {\\cdot} \\text{m}^2</math> (Gaussian and EMU),\n\nwhere statA is [[statampere]]s, cm is [[centimeter]]s, erg is [[erg]]s, and G is [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]. The ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal to the [[speed of light|speed of light in free space]], expressed in [[Centimetre|cm]]\u22c5[[Second|s]]<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nAll formulae in this article are correct in [[SI]] units; they may need to be changed for use in other unit systems. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current {{mvar|I}} and area {{mvar|A}} has magnetic moment {{mvar|IA}} (see below), but in [[Gaussian units]] the magnetic moment is {{math|{{sfrac|''IA''|[[speed of light|''c'']]}}}}.\n\nOther units for measuring the magnetic dipole moment include the [[Bohr magneton]] and the [[nuclear magneton]].\n\n=== Measurement ===\n{{main|magnetometer}}\n\nThe magnetic moments of objects are typically measured with devices called [[magnetometer]]s. Not all magnetometers measure magnetic moment though. Some are configured to measure [[magnetic field]] instead. If the magnetic field surrounding an object is known well enough, though, then the magnetic moment can be calculated from that magnetic field.\n\n== Relation to magnetization ==\n{{main|Magnetization}}\n{{see also|Remanence}}\n\nThe magnetic moment is a quantity that describes the magnetic strength of an entire object. Sometimes, though, it is useful or necessary to know how much of the net magnetic moment of the object is produced by a particular portion of that magnet. Therefore, it is useful to define the magnetization field <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{M} = \\frac{\\mathbf{m}_{\\Delta V}}{V_{\\Delta V}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{m}_{\\Delta V}</math> and <math>V_{\\Delta V}</math> are the magnetic dipole moment and volume of a sufficiently small portion of the magnet <math>\\Delta V</math>. This equation is often represented using derivative notation such that\n\n:<math>\\mathbf M=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf m}{\\mathrm{d}V},</math>\n\nwhere ''d'''''m''' is the elementary magnetic moment and ''dV'' is the [[volume element]]. The net magnetic moment of the magnet <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> therefore is\n:<math>\\mathbf m = \\iiint \\mathbf M\\,\\mathrm{d}V,</math>\n\nwhere the triple integral denotes integration over the volume of the [[Magnetic field|magnet]]. For uniform magnetization (where both the magnitude and the direction of <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> is the same for the entire magnet (such as a straight bar magnet) the last equation simplifies to:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{m} = \\mathbf{M} V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the volume of the bar magnet.\n\nThe magnetization is often not listed as a material parameter for commercially available [[ferromagnetic]] materials, though. Instead the parameter that is listed is [[residual flux density]] (or remanence), denoted  <math> \\textstyle \\mathbf{B}_r</math>. The formula needed in this case to calculate <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> in (units of A\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>) is:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{m} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\mathbf{B}_r V</math>,\n\nwhere:\n* <math> \\textstyle \\mathbf{B}_r</math> is the residual flux density, expressed in [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]].\n* <math> \\textstyle V</math> is the volume (m<sup>3</sup>) of the magnet.\n* <math> \\textstyle \\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ H/m}</math> is the permeability of vacuum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kjmagnetics.com/glossary.asp|title=K&J Magnetics \u2013 Glossary|author=|date=|website=www.kjmagnetics.com}}</ref>\n\n== Models ==\nThe preferred classical explanation of a magnetic moment has changed over time. Before the 1930s, textbooks explained the moment using hypothetical magnetic point charges. Since then, most have defined it in terms of Amp\u00e8rian currents.<ref name=Brown62>{{cite book|last=Brown|first = William Fuller, Jr.|author-link = William Fuller Brown, Jr.|title = Magnetostatic Principles in Ferromagnetism|year=1962 |publisher = [[North-Holland]]}}</ref> In magnetic materials, the cause of the magnetic moment are the [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic moment and angular momentum|spin and orbital angular momentum states]] of the [[Electron|electrons]], and varies depending on whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another.\n\n=== Magnetic pole model ===\n[[File:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|upright|An electrostatic analog for a magnetic moment: two opposing charges separated by a finite distance.]]\nThe sources of magnetic moments in materials can be represented by poles in analogy to [[electrostatics]].

Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since [[magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles]] always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels. This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors: the strength {{mvar|p}} of its poles (''magnetic pole strength''), and the vector {{mvar|'''l'''}} separating them. The magnetic dipole moment {{mvar|'''m'''}} is related to the fictitious poles as<ref name=\"Brown62\" />\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{m}=p\\boldsymbol{l}.</math>\n\nIt points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with [[angular momentum]] (see [[#Relation to angular momentum|Relation to angular momentum]]). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for [[Magnetostatics|magnetostatic]] calculations, particularly in applications to [[ferromagnets]].<ref name=Brown62/> Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the [[magnetic field]] by the [[irrotational]] field {{math|'''H'''}}, in analogy to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}.\n\n=== Amperian loop model ===\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines).

In this model developed by Amp\u00e8re, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{m}=I\\boldsymbol{S},</math>\n \nwhere {{math|''S''}} is the area of the loop.

While this relation is straight forward to develop for macroscopic currents using the amperian loop model (see [[#Magnetic moment and angular momentum|below]]), neither the magnetic pole model nor the amperian loop model truly represents what is occurring at the atomic and molecular levels. At that level [[quantum mechanics]] must be used. Fortunately, the linear relationship between the magnetic dipole moment of a particle and its angular momentum still holds; although it is different for each particle. Further, care must be used to distinguish between the intrinsic angular momentum (or [[spin (physics)|spin]]) of the particle and the particle's orbital angular momentum.

This phenomenon is known as [[magnetism]]. An applied magnetic field can flip the magnetic dipoles that make up the material causing both [[paramagnetism]] and [[ferromagnetism]].

While the net magnetic field produced by the system can also have higher-order [[multipole]] components, those will drop off with distance more rapidly, so that only the dipole component will dominate the magnetic field of the system at distances far away from it.\n\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole depends on the strength and direction of a magnet's magnetic moment <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> but drops off as the cube of the distance such that:\n\n:<math>{\\mathbf{H}}({\\mathbf{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(\\frac{3\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf r|^5}-\\frac{{\\mathbf{m}}}{|\\mathbf r|^3}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> is the [[magnetic field]] produced by the magnet and <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> is a vector from the center of the magnetic dipole to the location where the magnetic field is measured.

The first three terms of that series are called the [[Multipole expansion|monopole]] (represented by an isolated magnetic north or south pole) the [[Magnetic dipole|dipole]] (represented by two equal and opposite magnetic poles), and the [[Quadrupole#Magnetic quadrupole|quadrupole]] (represented by four poles that together form two equal and opposite dipoles). The magnitude of the magnetic field for each term decreases progressively faster with distance than the previous term, so that at large enough distances the first non-zero term will dominate.\n\nFor many magnets the first non-zero term is the magnetic dipole moment. (To date, no isolated [[magnetic monopole]]s have been experimentally detected.) A magnetic dipole is the limit of either a current loop or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the moment constant. As long as these limits only apply to fields far from the sources, they are equivalent. However, the two models give different predictions for the internal field (see below).\n\n=== Magnetic potentials ===\n{{Main|Magnetic potential}}\n\nTraditionally, the equations for the magnetic dipole moment (and higher order terms) are derived from theoretical quantities called [[magnetic potential]]s<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd|section=5.6|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0}}</ref> which are simpler to deal with mathematically then the magnetic fields.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, the relevant magnetic field is the [[demagnetizing field]] <math>\\mathbf{H}</math>. Since the demagnetizing portion of <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> does not include, by definition, the part of <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> due to free currents, there exists a [[magnetic scalar potential]] such that\n\n:<math>{\\mathbf{H}}({\\mathbf{r}})=-\\nabla\\psi</math>.\n\nIn the amperian loop model, the relevant magnetic field is the magnetic induction <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>. Since magnetic monopoles do not exist, there exists a [[magnetic vector potential]] such that\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}({\\mathbf{r}})=\\nabla\\times{\\mathbf{A}}.</math>\n\nBoth of these potentials can be calculated for any arbitrary current distribution (for the amperian loop model) or magnetic charge distribution (for the magnetic charge model) provided that these are limited to a small enough region to give:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{A} \\left(\\mathbf{r}, t\\right) &= \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\mathbf{j}\\left(\\mathbf{r}'\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\, \\mathrm{d}V', \\\\\n        \\psi \\left(\\mathbf{r}, t\\right) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\mathbf{r}'\\right)}{\\left|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\, \\mathrm{d}V',\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is the [[current density]] in the amperian loop model, <math>\\rho</math> is the magnetic pole strength density in analogy to the electric [[charge density]] that leads to the electric potential, and the integrals are the volume (triple) integrals over the coordinates that make up <math>\\mathbf{r}'</math>. The denominators of these equation can be expanded using the [[multipole expansion]] to give a series of terms that have larger of power of distances in the denominator. The first nonzero term, therefore, will dominate for large distances. The first non-zero term for the vector potential is:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf r)=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{\\mathbf m\\times\\mathbf r}{|\\mathbf r|^3},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> is:\n \n: <math>\\mathbf{m}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\iiint_V \\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{j}\\,{\\rm d}V,</math>\n\nwhere \u00d7 is the [[vector cross product]], {{math|'''r'''}} is the position vector, and {{math|'''j'''}} is the [[electric current density]] and the integral is a volume integral.\n\nIn the magnetic pole perspective, the first non-zero term of the [[Magnetic potential#Magnetic scalar potential|scalar potential]] is\n\n:<math>\\psi(\\mathbf r)=\\frac{\\mathbf m\\cdot\\mathbf r}{4\\pi|\\mathbf r|^3}.</math>\n\nHere <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> may be represented in terms of the magnetic pole strength density but is more usefully expressed in terms of the [[magnetization]] field as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf m=\\iiint \\mathbf M\\,\\mathrm{d}V.</math>\n\nThe same symbol <math>\\mathbf{m}</math> is used for both equations since they produce equivalent results outside of the magnet.\n\n=== External magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole moment ===\n\nThe [[magnetic flux density]] for a magnetic dipole in the amperian loop model, therefore, is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}({\\mathbf{r}})=\\nabla\\times{\\mathbf{A}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\left(\\frac{3\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf r|^5}-\\frac{{\\mathbf{m}}}{|\\mathbf r|^3}\\right).</math>\n\nFurther, the [[magnetic field strength]] <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> is\n:<math>{\\mathbf{H}}({\\mathbf{r}})=-\\nabla\\psi=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(\\frac{3\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf r|^5}-\\frac{{\\mathbf{m}}}{|\\mathbf r|^3}\\right).</math>\n\n=== Internal magnetic field of a dipole ===\n[[File:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|right|The magnetic field of a current loop]]\nThe two models for a dipole (current loop and magnetic poles) give the same predictions for the magnetic field far from the source. However, inside the source region, they give different predictions. The magnetic field between poles (see figure for [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic pole representation|Magnetic pole definition]]) is in the opposite direction to the magnetic moment (which points from the negative charge to the positive charge), while inside a current loop it is in the same direction (see the figure to the right). The limits of these fields must also be different as the sources shrink to zero size.

This effect is expressed on a [[macroscopic scale]] in the [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]], or \"rotation by magnetization,\" and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]], or \"magnetization by rotation.\"<ref name=Graham/> Further, a [[torque]] applied to a relatively isolated magnetic dipole such as an [[atomic nucleus]] can cause it to [[precession|precess]] (rotate about the axis of the applied field). This phenomenon is used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].\n\nViewing a magnetic dipole as current loop brings out the close connection between magnetic moment and angular momentum. Since the particles creating the current (by rotating around the loop) have charge and mass, both the magnetic moment and the angular momentum increase with the rate of rotation. The ratio of the two is called the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] or <math>\\gamma</math> so that:<ref name=Krey>{{cite book |title=Basic Theoretical Physics |first= Uwe|last1= Krey|first2= Anthony|last2= Owen |pages=151\u2013152 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZ_QelBmkxYC&pg=PA151 |isbn=978-3-540-36804-5 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}</ref><ref name=Buxton>{{cite book |first=Richard B.|last= Buxton |title=Introduction to functional magnetic resonance imaging |page=136 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6XVu0NKzgekC&pg=PA136 |isbn=978-0-521-58113-4 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{m} = \\gamma\\mathbf{L},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{L}</math> is the angular momentum of the particle or particles that are creating the magnetic moment.\n\nIn the amperian loop model, which applies for macroscopic currents, the gyromagnetic ratio is one half of the [[charge-to-mass ratio]].

For example the ''g''-factor for the magnetic moment due to an electron orbiting a nucleus is one while the ''g''-factor for the magnetic moment of electron due to its intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) is a little larger than 2. The ''g''-factor of atoms and molecules must account for the orbital and intrinsic moments of its electrons and possibly the intrinsic moment of its nuclei as well.\n\nIn the atomic world the angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of a particle is an [[integer]] (or [[half-integer]] in the case of spin) multiple of the reduced [[Planck constant]] {{mvar|\u0127}}. This is the basis for defining the magnetic moment units of [[Bohr magneton]] (assuming [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of the [[electron]]) and [[nuclear magneton]] (assuming [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of the [[proton]]). See [[electron magnetic moment]] and [[Bohr magneton]] for more details.\n\n== Atoms, molecules, and elementary particles ==\n\nFundamentally, contributions to any system's magnetic moment may come from sources of two kinds: motion of [[electric charge]]s, such as [[electric current]]s; and the [[Spin (physics)#Magnetic moments|intrinsic magnetism]] of [[elementary particle]]s, such as the [[electron]].\n\nContributions due to the sources of the first kind can be calculated from knowing the distribution of all the electric currents (or, alternatively, of all the electric charges and their velocities) inside the system, by using the formulas below. On the other hand, the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of each elementary particle's intrinsic magnetic moment is a fixed number, often measured experimentally to a great precision. For example, any electron's magnetic moment is measured to be {{val|-9.284764|e=-24|u=J/T}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?muem|title=CODATA Value: electron magnetic moment|website=physics.nist.gov}}</ref> The [[Euclidean vector|direction]] of the magnetic moment of any elementary particle is entirely determined by the direction of its [[spin (physics)|spin]], with the [[minus sign|negative value]] indicating that any electron's magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin.\n\nThe net magnetic moment of any system is a [[Euclidean vector|vector sum]] of contributions from one or both types of sources.\nFor example, the magnetic moment of an atom of [[Hydrogen atom|hydrogen-1]] (the lightest hydrogen isotope, consisting of a proton and an electron) is a vector sum of the following contributions:\n\n# the intrinsic moment of the electron,\n# the orbital motion of the electron around the proton,\n# the intrinsic moment of the proton.\n\nSimilarly, the magnetic moment of a [[bar magnet]] is the sum of the contributing magnetic moments, which include the intrinsic and orbital magnetic moments of the unpaired [[electron]]s of the magnet's material and the nuclear magnetic moments.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of an atom ===\nFor an atom, individual electron spins are added to get a total spin, and individual orbital angular momenta are added to get a total orbital angular momentum.

The first term describes precession of the moment about the effective field, while the second is a damping term related to dissipation of energy caused by interaction with the surroundings.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of an electron ===\n{{see also|Anomalous magnetic dipole moment}}\n[[Electron]]s and many elementary particles also have intrinsic [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moments]], an explanation of which requires a quantum mechanical treatment and relates to the intrinsic [[angular momentum]] of the particles as discussed in the article [[Electron magnetic moment]]. It is these intrinsic magnetic moments that give rise to the macroscopic effects of [[magnetism]], and other phenomena, such as [[electron paramagnetic resonance]].\n\nThe magnetic moment of the electron is\n: <math> \\mathbf{m}_\\text{S} = -\\frac{g_S \\mu_\\text{B} \\mathbf{S}}{\\hbar},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>B</sub>}} is the [[Bohr magneton]], {{math|'''S'''}} is electron [[spin (physics)|spin]], and the [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] {{mvar|g<sub>S</sub>}} is 2 according to [[Dirac equation|Dirac]]'s theory, but due to [[quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamic]] effects it is slightly larger in reality: {{val|2.00231930436}}. The deviation from 2 is known as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]].\n\nAgain it is important to notice that {{math|'''m'''}} is a negative constant multiplied by the [[spin (physics)|spin]], so the magnetic moment of the electron is antiparallel to the spin. This can be understood with the following classical picture: if we imagine that the spin angular momentum is created by the electron mass spinning around some axis, the electric current that this rotation creates circulates in the opposite direction, because of the negative charge of the electron; such current loops produce a magnetic moment which is antiparallel to the spin. Hence, for a positron (the anti-particle of the electron) the magnetic moment is parallel to its spin.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of a nucleus ===\n{{See also|Nuclear magnetic moment}}\nThe nuclear system is a complex physical system consisting of nucleons, i.e., [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. The quantum mechanical properties of the nucleons include the spin among others. Since the electromagnetic moments of the nucleus depend on the spin of the individual nucleons, one can look at these properties with measurements of nuclear moments, and more specifically the nuclear magnetic dipole moment.\n\nMost common nuclei exist in their [[ground state]], although nuclei of some [[isotope]]s have long-lived [[excited state]]s. Each [[energy state]] of a nucleus of a given isotope is characterized by a well-defined magnetic dipole moment, the magnitude of which is a fixed number, often measured experimentally to a great precision. This number is very sensitive to the individual contributions from nucleons, and a measurement or prediction of its value can reveal important information about the content of the nuclear wave function. There are several theoretical models that predict the value of the magnetic dipole moment and a number of experimental techniques aiming to carry out measurements in nuclei along the nuclear chart.\n\n=== Magnetic moment of a molecule ===\nAny molecule has a well-defined magnitude of magnetic moment, which may depend on the molecule's [[energy state]]. Typically, the overall magnetic moment of a molecule is a combination of the following contributions, in the order of their typical strength:\n* magnetic moments due to its unpaired [[electron spin]]s ([[paramagnetic]] contribution), if any\n* orbital motion of its electrons, which in the [[Stationary state#Ground state|ground state]] is often proportional to the external magnetic field ([[diamagnetic]] contribution)\n* the combined magnetic moment of its [[nuclear spin]]s, which depends on the [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-spin coupling|nuclear spin configuration]].\n\n==== Examples of molecular magnetism ====\n* The [[Oxygen|dioxygen]] molecule, O<sub>2</sub>, exhibits strong [[paramagnetism]], due to unpaired spins of its outermost two electrons.\n* The [[carbon dioxide]] molecule, CO<sub>2</sub>, mostly exhibits [[diamagnetism]], a much weaker magnetic moment of the electron [[Molecular orbital|orbitals]] that is proportional to the external magnetic field. The nuclear magnetism of a magnetic [[isotope]] such as <sup>13</sup>C or <sup>17</sup>O will contribute to the molecule's magnetic moment.\n* The [[dihydrogen]] molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, in a weak (or zero) magnetic field exhibits nuclear magnetism, and can be in a [[parahydrogen|para-]] or an [[orthohydrogen|ortho-]] nuclear spin configuration.\n* Many transition metal complexes are magnetic. The spin-only formula is a good first approximation for high-spin complexes of first-row [[transition metal]]s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last2=Lewis |first2=J. |last1=Figgis |first1=B.

The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.\n\nAt the mouth of the Achelous River lie the [[Echinades]] Islands. According to Ovid's pretty myth-making in the same ''Metamorphoses'' episode, the Echinades Islands were once five nymphs. Unfortunately for them, they forgot to honor Achelous in their festivities, and the god was so angry about this slight that he turned them into the islands.\n\nIn Hellenistic and Roman contexts, the river god was often reduced to a mask and used decoratively as an emblem of water, \"his uncut hair wreathed with reeds\".<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' ix.</ref> The feature survived in Romanesque carved details and flowered during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the Classical prototypes of the [[Green Man]].\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Image:Annibale Fontana - Plaque with Hercules and Achelous - Walters 4171.jpg|thumb|The fight of Heracles and the river-god Achelous is depicted in this plaque by [[Annibale Fontana]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21338 |title= Plaque with Hercules and Achelous }}</ref>]]\n\nThe contest of Achelous with Heracles was represented on the throne of [[Amyclae]],<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.18.16 3.18.16].</ref> and in the treasury of the [[Megara]]ns at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] there was a statue of him made by [[Dontas]] of cedarwood and gold.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.19.12 6.19.12].</ref> Achelous was sometimes depicted as a gray-haired old man or a vigorous bearded man in his prime, with a horned head and a serpent-like body.

Zayd was 11 years old when he asked permission to participate in the [[Battle of Badr]]. Since he was younger than 15 years old, Muhammad did not allow him to do so, and sent him back. He then decided to try to win favor with Muhammad by learning the [[Quran]]. He was later appointed to write letters to non-Muslims and to collect and keep record of the Qur'anic verses. Zayd was among those chosen by Muhammad to write down the verses of the Quran. He used to spend most of his time reciting the Quran, and continued to learn the Quranic verses as they were recited by Muhammad. Zayd later volunteered to fight when he was 19 years old. This time he was accepted in the ranks of the Muslim army. Zayd's time to fight had come nine years after the establishment of the Muslim community in Medina.\n\nZayd had the role of writing down the Quranic verses that Muslims believe were sent to Muhammad from Allah through the Angel [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Jibrail]].\n\nAfter Muhammad's death, Zayd, who by this time had become an expert in the Quran, was assigned the role of authenticating and collecting the oral and textual Quranic revelation into a single bounded volume. This initiative was high on the Caliph [[Abu Bakr]]'s agenda, especially after the [[Ridda wars]], and the [[Battle of Yamamah]] in particular, in which a large number of Quran memorizers perished. Umar convinced Abu Bakr that the Quran should be collected in one manuscript. During Abu Bakr's reign as caliph, he was given the task of collecting the Quranic verses from all over the Muslim communities. Zayd finally accepted the task and, according to him, started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men. When Zayd had completed his task, he left the prepared sheets with Abu Bakr. Before he died, Abu Bakr left the sheets with Umar who in turn left it with his daughter Hafsah. Hafsah, Umm Salamah and Aishah were wives of Muhammad who memorized the Quran.\n\nZayd ibn Thabit thus became one of the foremost authorities on the Quran.

Umar convinced Abu Bakr that the Quran should be collected in one manuscript.\n\nDuring [[Abu Bakr]]'s reign as [[caliph]], he was given the task of collecting the Quranic verses from all over Arabia. Zayd finally accepted the task and, according to him, \"started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart)\".\n\nWhen Zayd had completed his task, he left the prepared suhuf (sheets) with Abu Bakr.

The blockade failed because two relief convoys entered unmolested\u2014the first under Admiral [[George Rodney]] in 1780 and the second under Admiral [[George Darby]] in 1781\u2014despite the presence of the Spanish fleets. The same year, a major assault was planned by the Spanish, but the Gibraltar garrison [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortied]] in November and destroyed much of the forward batteries. With the siege going nowhere and constant Spanish failures, the besiegers were reinforced by French forces under [[Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon|de Crillon]], who took over command in early 1782. After a lull in the siege, during which the allied force gathered more guns, ships and troops, a \"Grand Assault\" was launched on 18 September 1782. This involved huge numbers\u201460,000 men, 49 ships of the line and ten specially designed, newly invented [[Floating battery|floating batteries]]\u2014against the 5,000 defenders. The assault was a disastrous failure, resulting in heavy losses for the Bourbon allies.\n\nThe siege then settled down again to more of a blockade, but the final defeat for the allies came when a crucial British relief convoy under Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] slipped through the blockading fleet and arrived at the garrison in October 1782. The siege was finally lifted on 7 February 1783 and was a decisive victory for the British forces, being a vital factor in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]], which had been negotiated towards the end of the siege.<ref>Faulkner p xix</ref>{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|bc}}\n\nThis was the largest action fought during the war in terms of numbers, particularly the \"Grand Assault\".

Initially, both sides intended to sign an agreement at the Spanish [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], but in January of the following year, the [[British Parliament]] rejected the advice of Foreign Minister [[Robert Walpole]], a supporter of the agreement with Spain.<ref name=\"Sayer9\">{{cite book|last1=Sayer|first1=Frederick|title=The History of Gibraltar and of Its Political Relation to Events in Europe: From the Commencement of the Moorish Dynasty in Spain to the Last Morocco War|date=1862|publisher=Saunders, Otley, and Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_68cNAAAAQAAJ/page/n25 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_68cNAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> A short time later, the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] began, and both countries declared war on 23 October 1739, each side drawing up plans to establish trenches near Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Richmond\">Richmond p.9</ref> Seeing these first movements, Britain ordered [[Edward Vernon|Admiral Vernon]] to sail from [[Portobelo, Panama|Portobello]] and strengthen the squadron of [[Nicholas Haddock|Admiral Haddock]] who was already stationed in the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"Harding\">Harding p. 39</ref>\n\nThe passage of years failed to break the hostilities in the region. Then on 9 July 1746, [[King Philip V of Spain]] died in [[Madrid]]. His successor, [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]], soon began negotiations with Britain on trade. The British Parliament was amenable to such negotiations, and even looked favourably upon lifting the British [[embargo]] on Spain and possibly ceding Gibraltar. The neutrality adopted by Ferdinand VI quickly ended with his death in 1759. The new king, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], was less willing to negotiate with Great Britain. Instead, he signed a [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] with [[Louis XV of France]] on 15 August 1761. At that time France was at war with Britain, so Britain responded by declaring war on Spain and capturing the Spanish colonial capitals of [[Manila]] and [[Havana]]. Two years later, after cessation of hostilities, Spain recovered Manila and Havana in exchange for [[Spanish Florida|Spanish holdings in Florida]] as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]].<ref name=\"Simms\">Simms p. 496</ref>\n\nIn the years of peace that followed both France and Spain hoped for an opportunity to launch a war against Britain on more favourable terms and recover their lost colonial possessions.  Following the outbreak of the [[American War of Independence]], both states supplied funding and arms to the American rebels, and drew up a strategy to intervene on the American side and defeat Britain.{{Sfn|Harvey|2001|p=362}}\n\nIn October 1778 France entered the war and on 12 April 1779, both France and Spain signed the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] wherein they agreed to aid one another in recovering lost territory from Britain.<ref>{{Citation|last=Clarfield|first=Gerard|title=United States Diplomatic History: From Revolution to Empire|place=New Jersey|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1992}}.</ref> France and Spain sought to secure Gibraltar, which was a key link in Britain's control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and expected its capture to be relatively quick\u2014a precursor to a Franco-Spanish invasion of Great Britain.<ref name=\"c1\">{{cite web|url = http://www.keepmilitarymuseum.org/gibraltar.php?&dx=1&ob=3 |title=The Great Siege of Gibraltar|publisher=The Keep Military Museum|accessdate =6 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Opposing forces===\n{| style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Mart\u00edn Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Soto-Flores, conde de Colomera (Museo del Prado).jpg|</center><br>Mart\u00edn Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor\u2014[[Spanish army]] commander\nFile:George Augustus Eliott, Baron Heathfield.jpg|<center><br />[[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield]]\u2014British [[Governor of Gibraltar]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe Spanish blockade was to be directed by [[Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor]]. Spanish ground forces were composed of 16 infantry battalions, which included the [[Spanish Royal Guard|Royal Guards]] and the [[Walloon Guard]]s, along with artillery and 12 squadrons of cavalry. This yielded a total of about 14,000 men in all.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=33}} The artillery was commanded by [[Rudesindo Tilly]], while the cavalry and the French [[dragoon]]s were headed by the [[Marquis of Arellano]].

All the defences were strengthened; the main physical task facing Eliott was an extensive building programme of new fortifications for Gibraltar, as set out in a report by a commission that had examined the state of the Rock's defences in the early 1770s. The most prominent new work was the [[King's Bastion]] designed by [[Sir William Green, 1st Baronet|Sir William Green]] and built by the [[Soldier Artificer Company]] on the main waterfront of the town in Gibraltar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gates & Fortifications \u2013 King's Bastion|url=http://www.aboutourrock.com/sites/fortifications.htm|publisher=aboutourrock.com|access-date=30 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101022932/http://www.aboutourrock.com/sites/fortifications.htm|archive-date=1 November 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The King's Bastion comprised a stone battery holding 26 heavy guns and mortars, with barracks and [[casemate]]s to house a full battalion of foot. The [[Grand Battery, Gibraltar|Grand Battery]] protected the [[Landport (Gibraltar)|Land Port Gate]], the main entrance to Gibraltar from the isthmus connecting to the Spanish mainland. Other fortifications and batteries crowded along the town's waterfront and on the Rock.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=53}}\n\nEliott began a programme of increasing the number of guns deployed in the batteries and fortifications, which initially stood at 412, many of them inoperable. Many of the infantry assisted the artillery in serving the guns. The garrison included three battalions of [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] and around 80 [[Corsica]]n troops. Eliott also formed a [[corps]] of [[sharpshooter]]s. The navy had only a token force; most of the sailors and marines were used on shore, but one ship of the line, [[HMS Panther (1758)|HMS ''Panther'']], was being used as a [[Hulk (ship type)|hulk]] and [[floating battery]]. The frigate [[HMS Enterprise (1774)|HMS ''Enterprise'']] and 12 gunboats were also present.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=40}} Elliott's determined handling of the preparations inspired all the troops under him with the greatest confidence. The British had anticipated an attack for some time, and many ships had sailed to reinforce and supply Gibraltar.{{Sfn|Sugden|2004|pp=109\u201310}} Britain stepped up preparations after France entered the conflict in 1778, although the French were initially more concerned with sending forces to America, and it was not until Spain joined the war that the long-expected siege commenced.{{Sfn|Harvey|2001|pp=385\u201387}}\n\n==Siege==\n[[File:Vue perspective du siege de Gibraltar commence en 1779 par les Espagnols.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of Gibraltar under siege from Spanish fleet and land positions in foreground]]\n\nOn 16 June 1779, the Spanish issued what was in effect a declaration of war against Great Britain, and a blockade immediately commenced. On 6 July 1779, an engagement took place between the British ships and Spanish vessels bringing supplies to the Spanish troops on shore. Several Spanish vessels were taken and the hostilities began. The combined Spanish and French fleets [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army constructed [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=53}}\n\nAs the winter of 1779 came, provisions for the garrison soon became scarce. Bread was almost impossible to obtain and was not permitted to be issued except to the sick and children. [[Salt-cured meat|Salt meat]] and biscuits soon became a major part of the [[rationing|rations]], with an occasional issue of four ounces of rice each day. Fuel was exhausted, and fires were made only with difficulty, using the salt-encrusted timbers of old ships broken up in the harbour for the purpose. As a result, a violent outbreak of [[scurvy]] occurred among the troops, owing to the lack of vegetables and medicines.<ref name=\"Faulkner46\">Faulkner p. 46</ref> Eliott appealed to London for relief, but as the winter wore on rations were reduced further. Despite this, the garrison's morale remained high, and the troops continued to take their turns at various posts of duty. They had also repulsed several small testing assaults made by the Spanish and had great faith that they would receive supplies by sea, and so they endured the cold and hunger.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=38}}\n\nThe Spanish were forced to commit a greater number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned Invasion of England, owing to this and the cancellation of the [[Armada of 1779]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Alfred Temple|title=The Other Armada: The Franco-Spanish Attempt to Invade Britain in 1779|date=1960|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=217|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lt9RAQAAIAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n===First naval relief===\n[[File:Gibraltar Relieved By Sir George Rodney.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral George Rodney's relief fleet at Gibraltar with captured Spanish battleships from the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]], by [[Dominic Serres]]]]\n\nIn December 1779, a large convoy sailed from England to Gibraltar, escorted by 21 ships of the line under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]]. On their way, they encountered and captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finisterre]] on 8 January 1780. They planned to provision the Gibraltar garrison further with the goods they had captured.<ref>{{London Gazette|page=1|issue=12056|date=8 January 1780}}</ref> The Spanish soon learned of the convoy and sent a fleet under [[Juan de Langara]] to intercept it, but underestimated the escort's strength, and Langara's ships soon had to flee. Rodney caught up with and defeated the Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], taking five ships of the line and additional supplies.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|p=105}} The fleet easily penetrated the Spanish blockade and reached Gibraltar on 25 January 1780, bringing reinforcements of 1,052 men of the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot|73rd Highland regiment of foot]] under [[George Mackenzie (1741\u20131787)|George Mackenzie]] and an abundance of supplies, including the captured Spanish goods.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=100}} This greatly heartened the garrison, but as soon as Rodney's fleet left, the siege resumed.<ref name=\"Mahan450\">Mahan, pp. 450\u201351</ref>\n\nThe British defenders resisted every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault. While the two sides unceasingly exchanged shot and shell, by the end of the summer, provisions again began to run low, and scurvy began to reappear, reducing the effective strength of the garrison. Through the use of small, fast-sailing ships that ran the blockade, they were able to keep in communication with the British forces [[Invasion of Minorca (1781)|besieged]] on [[Minorca]], but that force was also low on supplies.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=103}}\n[[File:AntonioBarcel\u00f3An\u00f3nimo1848.jpg|thumb|200px|Spanish maritime commander [[Antonio Barcel\u00f3]]]]\n\nOn 7 June 1780 the two largest ships of Gibraltar, HMS ''Panther'' and HMS ''Enterprise'', were targeted within Gibraltar's harbour by Spanish [[Fire ship|fireships]].<ref name=\"Davis\">Davis pp. 183\u201387</ref> Warning shots from ''Enterprise'' alerted the garrison and soon an intense bombardment slowed the fire ships. A few were sunk but the others carried on; the Spanish fleet waited just outside the harbour for any British ships trying to escape, so seamen from ''Panther'' and ''Enterprise'' set out in [[longboat]]s, intercepted the fire ships, and towed them off course.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=116}}\n\n===Second naval relief===\nThroughout the second winter the garrison faced foes, elements, disease, and starvation. By March the situation was serious: the garrison and civilians were on weekly rations and in need of a large supply. For the Spanish the blockade was working, with the few small ships that slipped past the blockade carrying insufficient supplies.<ref name=\"Gardiner179\">Gardiner p.177\u2212179</ref>\n[[File:1783 Captain Spilsbury Map of Gibraltar Rosia and Spanish Gunboats.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Sketch of Spanish Gunboats off [[Rosia Bay]], Gibraltar]]\n\nOn 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England entered the bay, despite the Spanish fleet.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=41\u201342}} The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, for the first time in the siege opened up a terrific barrage while the stores were unloaded. Although they caused great damage to the town, the South Mole where the ships unloaded their stores was out of their reach. The civilian population of about 1,000 sailed with Darby for England on 21 April, leaving the garrison with fewer mouths to feed and allowing them to operate more freely. Again the fleet left without hindrance during the night and slipped past the blockading Spanish fleet. Provisions for the garrison were now plentiful, including black powder, guns and ammunition as well as food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Faulkner53\">Faulkner p. 53</ref>\n\nThe French and Spanish thus found it impossible to starve the garrison out. They therefore resolved to make further attacks by land and sea and assembled a large army and fleet to carry this out. In addition, the Spanish built a succession of new batteries across the isthmus:{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=186}} soon there were four of them each containing around fourteen guns. There were also the preexisting San Carlos, San Felipe, and Santa Barbara batteries, each containing around 24 to 27 guns.\n\nOn 9 June, the British gunners hit a major Spanish magazine, which exploded. The main explosion was followed by a host of minor ones, as expense magazines, subsidiary stores and shells blew up. The Spanish lines were in pandemonium as the troops struggled to put out the numerous fires that started in their camp. Eventually order was restored and the fires failed to halt the Spanish effort of battery building. By late 1781 there were around fifty mortars, bringing the besiegers' total to 114 guns, ranging from heavy 24 pounders to twelve-inch mortars.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n===Sortie===\nBy November, just as hunger began to start again for the garrison, they received word from some Spanish deserters that a massive assault was planned. General Eliott decided that a night [[sortie]] to attack the Spanish and French on the eve of their assault would be the perfect move.<ref name=Faulkner59>Faulkner pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n[[File:1871 - The Sortie.jpg|thumb|700px|thumb|center|A detailed view of the sortie from above the [[Prince's Lines]]]]\n\nOn 27 November 1781, the night before they were to launch the grand attack, the British made their surprise sortie. In all 2,435 soldiers with 99 officers were involved, organised into three columns of around 700\u2013800 men each\u2014\u2014they included engineers and pioneers who were armed with axes and firing equipment.<ref name=Faulkner59/> At around 2:00 they marched towards the besiegers' lines. The right column came across the Spanish sentries at the end of the parallel, charged, and stormed the lines, bayoneting the Spanish defenders. While the rest of the defenders retreated, the eastern flank of the Spanish advanced works was taken and consolidated.<ref name=Davis/> One detachment of the right column, a group of Hanoverians, got lost in the dark, mistook its target and found themselves at the base of the huge San Carlos mortar battery.<ref>\n{{cite book| last= Grant| first= James| title= British battles on land and sea, Volume 2| date= 1873| publisher= Cassell| pages= 181\u201382| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ykkBAAAAQAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\nHaving realised their mistake, they decided to attack the position, and after some heavy fighting the position was taken. This battery had been the intended target of the centre column, which came up and reinforced the position and prepared for a Spanish counterattack. Meanwhile the left column struck along the seashore meeting light resistance; the flank companies of the 73rd Highlanders charged ahead and stormed the San Pascual and the San Martin batteries and took the trenches, putting the Spanish to flight.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=49}}\n[[File:Spanish Grenadier Napoles.jpg|thumb|200px|A Spanish Grenadier of the Napoles regiment]]\n[[File:73rdFootOfficer.jpg|thumb|left|220px|An officer of the 73rd Highlanders]]<!-- [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot]]???-->\n\nElliot decided to come out and view the victory, much to the surprise of the British officers. A badly wounded Spanish artillery officer [[Jos\u00e9 de Barboza]] refused to be moved \u2014\u2013 Elliot tried to persuade him but he asked to be \"left alone and perish amid the ruin of my post\". This would be an inspiration for a painting by John Trumbull.<ref name=Hoock>Hoock p. 114</ref> With all the Spanish forward positions secured, the British set upon the destruction of provisions, ammunition, weapons, defensive structures, taking booty and [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiking]] the guns. They set fire to the ammunition and the siege works were engulfed in flames. Soon after, Spanish cavalry were observed coming up; they faced a Hanoverian battalion but did not charge. The Spanish under Alvarez had no plans and were neither expecting nor prepared for a British sortie.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nWith the objective completed, the British withdrew back inside their fortifications. The total British and Hanoverian casualties in the sortie were two killed and 25 wounded. Spanish losses were over 100 men, which included thirty prisoners; a number of these were blue-coated Walloon soldiers of the [[Walloon Guards]].<ref name=Faulkner69>Faulkner p. 69</ref> The British did damage to the extent of two million pounds to the besiegers: fourteen months of work by the Spanish and a considerable quantity of ammunition had been destroyed. British troops and pioneers spiked ten thirteen-inch mortars and eighteen twenty-six-pounder guns in the Spanish siege works. In addition the platforms and beds on which the guns were based were also destroyed. As the British returned after their victorious sortie the garrison watched in amazement as huge explosions from the ammunition ripped through the Spanish lines and destroyed what was left of them.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=216}}\n[[File:Koehler's Depressing Carriage.jpg|thumb|300px|Koehler's Depressing Carriage]]\n\nThis sortie postponed the great Spanish assault for several months. In that time the British began building an [[Great Siege Tunnels|extensive tunnel network]] through the Rock of Gibraltar. The work was carried out by hand aided by [[gunpowder]] blasts, which was dangerous. It took thirteen men five weeks to dig a tunnel with a width of {{convert|8|sqft|m2}} and a length of {{convert|82|ft|m}}. [[Embrasure]]s were blasted overlooking the Spanish lines. Additionally, a new type of cannon mount was invented that allowed a cannon to fire at a downward angle. The [[Koehler Depressing Carriage|new depressing gun-carriage]] was devised by [[George Koehler]] which allowed guns to be fired down a slope.<ref name=Faulkner68>Faulkner p. 68</ref> This was demonstrated on 15 February 1782 at [[Princess Royal's Battery]].<ref>Red Plaque in [[Grand Casemates Square]].</ref> This new carriage enabled the defending guns to take advantage of the height of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]: they could strike out far, but also be angled downward to fire on approaching attackers.<ref name=ff29>Finlayson p.29</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of March news of the surrender of the Minorca garrison was received and lowered morale for the besieged. The Spanish and French at Gibraltar would soon be reinforced by the victors of Minorca.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=224}} Life however in Gibraltar was able to carry on with relief from merchants who ran the Spanish blockade. British ships arrived unmolested to bring in reinforcements, taking away the sick, prisoners and civilians. Portuguese vessels with [[lemon]]s, wine and vegetables helped the garrison, and gave valuable intelligence on the Spanish lines and the heavy casualties suffered from the British guns. News of HMS ''Success'''s [[Action of 16 March 1782|defeat]] of a Spanish frigate ''Santa Catalina'' bought much rejoicing to the rock when she entered.<ref name=Gardiner167>Gardiner p.167\u2212170</ref>\n\n===Arrival of the French===\n[[File:Luis Berton de Balbe de Quiers, duque de Crillon.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon|De Crillon]], the French commander, who took over operations at Gibraltar.]]\n\nSoon after the surrender of Minorca, French forces from that siege arrived to help the Spanish at Gibraltar. In particular, French engineers and pioneers were brought in, and [[Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon]] took over from \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor as commander of the besiegers, with the final say in operations. \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor was effectively demoted to take command of the Spanish contingent. Both the Spanish and the French hoped for more imaginative concepts and arrangements to bring about victory. French ships joined de C\u00f3rdova's already powerful Spanish navy to strengthen the blockade. During this time it was decided to construct the special floating batteries, and soon the British garrison observed hulks being brought into the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|p=287}} The American diplomat [[Louis Littlepage]] acted as a volunteer aide to de Crillon during the siege and made sketches of the operations.<ref name=\"Howe\">{{cite book|last1=[[Henry Howe|Howe, Henry]]|title=Adventures and Achievements of Americans: A Series of Narratives Illustrating Their Heroism, Self-reliance, Genius and Enterprise|date=1858|publisher=Geo.

A new Spanish battery, the Mahon, was erected in quick time, despite being hit many times by the British siege guns, which caused severe losses. Elliot though did not strike once it had been finished in April 1782.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|pp=244\u201346}}\n\nA lull in the siege then occurred, with each side not knowing when the other would bombard; this went on through the summer. On 11 June, a Spanish shell exploded inside the magazine of [[Princess Anne's Battery]] further up the Rock, causing a massive explosion that blew the flank of the battery into the [[Prince's Lines]], killing 14 soldiers.<ref name=\"connolly\">{{cite book|title=History of the Royal Sappers and Miners: from the formation of the Corps in March 1772, to the date when its designation was changed to that of Royal Engineers, in October 1856, Volume 1|year=1857|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0XzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=|author=Connolly, Thomas William John|edition=2|pages=16, 23}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of Spanish batteries ===\nIn early September the Spanish advanced their lines further, right up to the British siege guns' effective range. Elliot suggested to his artillery general Boyd to bombard the lines with red-hot shot and grapeshot, which had been used to great effect against Spanish gunboats daring to come close to make an attack. These \"hot potatoes\", as they were nicknamed, were pre-heated to furnace temperatures before being fired at the dry wooden defences.<ref name=Bond25>Bond, p. 25</ref>\n\nAt 7&nbsp;am on 8 September 1782 the bombardment commenced, concentrating mainly on the western parallel of the Spanish siege works. Supporting the heavy guns were the field artillery and other types of British guns. Within a few hours of intense bombardment the results became apparent and soon exceeded the garrison's expectations.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=64\u201365}} The Mahon battery along with conjoining works were set on fire.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|p=309}} The other batteries San Carlos and San Martin were heavily damaged and had to be partly dismantled by French and Spanish pioneers.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=272}}\n\nThe bombardment was a huge success and had inflicted great damage: Spanish and French casualties numbered at least 280.

Ideas were put forward to break the siege once and for all. The plan was proposed that a squadron of battery ships should take on the British land-based batteries and pound them into submission by numbers and weight of shots fired, before a storming party attacked from the siege works on the Isthmus and further troops were put ashore from the waiting Spanish fleet.<ref name=Faulkner102>Faulkner p. 102</ref> The French engineer [[Jean Le Michaud d'Ar\u00e7on]] invented and designed the floating batteries\u2014\u2018unsinkable\u2019 and \u2018unburnable\u2019\u2014intended to attack from the sea in tandem with other batteries bombarding the British from land. The floating batteries would have strong thick wooden armour\u2014{{convert|1|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-wide}} timbers packed with layers of wet sand and with water pumped over them to avoid fire breaking out.<ref name=Ferreiro288>Ferreiro pp. 288\u201390</ref> In addition old cables would also deaden the fall of British shot and, as ballast, would counterbalance the guns' weight. Guns were to be fired from one side only; the starboard battery was removed completely and the port battery heavily augmented with timber and sand infill. The ten floating batteries would be supported by ships of the line and [[bomb ships]], which would try to draw away and split up the British fire. Five batteries each with two rows of guns together with five smaller batteries each with a single row would provide a total of 150 guns.<ref name=Faulkner102/> The Spanish enthusiastically received the proposal. D'Arcon sailed close to shore under enemy fire in a skiff to get more accurate intelligence.<ref name=Bond28/>\n[[File:Le Michaud d'Ar\u00e7on.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jean Le Michaud d'Ar\u00e7on]], French engineer and designer of the floating batteries]]\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5,260 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138{{Sfn|Monti|1852|p=140}} to 212 heavy guns, and with Don Buenaventura Moreno commanding.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=67}} Also in support were the combined Spanish and French fleet, which consisted of 49 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels, manned by a total of 30,000 sailors and marines<ref name=Bond28>Bond, pp. 28\u201329</ref> under the command of Spanish Admiral [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova|Luis de C\u00f3rdova]].<ref name=Faulkner104>Faulkner p. 104</ref>{{Sfn|Monti|1852|p=138}} They were supported by 86 land guns{{Sfn |Monti |1852| p=138}} and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000{{Sfn|Monti|1852|p=132}}\u20138,000{{Sfn|Montero|1860|p=356}} French) on land, intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=76|ps=:'35,000 allied troops camped outside'}} An 'army' of over 80,000 spectators thronged the adjacent hills on the Spanish side, expecting to see the fortress beaten to powder and 'the [[Union Flag|British flag]] trailed in the dust'. Among them were the highest families in the land, including the [[Charles X of France|Comte D'Artois]].{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=65}} \n\nThe batteries slowly moved forward along the bay; one by one the 138 guns opened fire, but soon events did not go according to plan. The alignments were not correct; the two lead ships ''Pastora'' and the ''Tala Piedra'' moved further ahead than they should have.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=335\u201338}} When they opened fire on their main target, the King's Battery, the British guns replied but the cannonballs were observed to bounce off their hulls. Eventually the Spanish ''junks'' were anchored on the sandbanks near the Mole but were too spread out to create any significant damage to the British walls.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nMeanwhile, after weeks of preparatory artillery fire, the 200 heavy-calibre Spanish and French guns opened up on the land side from the North directed onto the fortifications. This caused some casualties and damage, but by noon the artificers had heated up [[Heated shot|red-hot shot]]. Once the shot were ready, Elliot ordered them to be fired. Heated shot was actually quicker to load since it did not need to be rammed.{{cn|date=July 2019}}{{why|date=July 2019}} At first the heated shot made no difference, as many were doused on board the floating batteries.<ref name=Bond28/>\n[[File:Vue du siege de Gibraltar et explosion des batteries flottantes 1782.jpeg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|Grand Assault on Gibraltar showing the allied lines and a detonation of one the floating batteries]]\n\nAlthough the batteries had anchored, a number had soon grounded and began to suffer damage to the rigging and masts. The King's Bastion blasted away at the closest ships, the ''Pastora'' and the ''Talla Peidra'', and soon the British guns began to have effect. Smoke was spotted coming from ''Talla Piedra'', already severely damaged with its rigging in tatters.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=335\u201338}} Panic ensued since no vessel could come and support her; nor was there any way of the ship escaping. Meanwhile the ''Pastora'' under the [[Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen|Prince de Nassau]] began to emit a huge amount of smoke. Despite efforts to find the cause, the sailors on board were fighting a losing battle.<ref name=Faulkner118>Faulkner p. 118</ref> To make matters worse, the Spanish land guns had ceased firing. It soon became apparent to de Crillon that the Spanish army had run out of powder and were already low on shot. By nightfall it was clear that the assault had failed, but worse was to come because the fire on the two batteries was out of control. To add to de Crillon's frustration, de C\u00f3rdova's ships of the line failed to move in support, and neither did Barcelo's vessels.<ref name=Bond28/> De Crillon, acknowledging defeat and not wishing to upset the Spanish by issuing demands, soon ordered the floating batteries to be scuttled and the crews rescued. Rockets were sent up from the batteries as distress signals.<ref name=Faulkner118/>\n\n=== Destruction of the floating batteries ===\nDuring this operation, [[Roger Curtis]], the British naval commander, seeing the attacking force in great danger, warned Elliot about the huge potential death toll and that something must be done. Elliot agreed and had the fleet of twelve gunboats under Curtis set out with 250 men. They headed towards the Spanish gunboats, firing as they advanced. The Spanish precipitated a quick retreat.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=79\u201380}}\n[[File:Thomas Whitcombe Batteries destruction1782c.jpg|thumb|left|The aftermath of the destruction of the floating batteries; by [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]\n\nCurtis' gunboats reached the batteries and one by one took them; but this soon turned into a rescue effort when they realised from prisoners that many men were still on board with the scuttling now taking place.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=39\u201340}} British marines then stormed the ''Pastora'', taking the men on board as prisoners and eventually pulled them off the doomed ship, having also seized the Spanish Royal Standard. As this was going on, the flames that had engulfed ''Talla Piedra'' soon reached the magazine. The ensuing explosion was tremendous, with a sound that reverberated around the bay and a huge mushroom cloud of smoke and debris that rose up in the air.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=81\u201382}} Many were killed on board but the British had few casualties. The Spanish, now in panic, all reached for the British boats by jumping in the water. Soon the ''Pastora'', engulfed in a mass of flames, followed the fate of the ''Talla Piedra'': another huge explosion ensued. This time many in the water were killed outright; a British boat was sunk and the [[coxswain]] of Curtis's boat was killed when hit by debris.<ref name=Bond28/>\n\nCurtis realised that it was unsafe to be near the flaming batteries and soon withdrew men from two more floating batteries engulfed in flame, then finally ordered a withdrawal.<ref name=Bond28/> The rescue operation was hindered further when Spanish batteries opened fire after receiving more powder and shot. Many more men drowned or were burned in the ensuing inferno; others were hit by their own artillery. The Spanish ceased fire only when the mistake was realised, but it was too late.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=39\u201340}} The rest of the Spanish batteries blew up in similar horrific style; the explosions lofted huge mushroom clouds that rose nearly 1,000 feet in the air.<ref name=Ferreiro288/> Some men were still on board and those that had jumped overboard often drowned as the vast majority couldn't swim. By the early hours of the morning only two floating batteries remained. A Spanish [[Felucca]] tried to set one on fire but was driven off by British guns. The two were promptly set alight by them and were finished in the same way as the others by the afternoon.{{Sfn|Montero|1860|pp=365\u201366}}\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG L0183.tiff|thumb|320px|Spanish flag captured during the Grand Assault in September 1782.

During the Grand Assault 40,000 rounds had been fired. Casualties in just 12 hours were heavy: 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.<ref>{{Citation| title= Bajas espa\u00f1olas de las bater\u00edas flotantes del ataque a Gibraltar el 13 de septiembre de 1782 | newspaper= Gaceta de Madrid| publisher= Todo a Babor| language= Spanish| url= http://www.todoababor.es/datos_docum/bajas-flotantes.html| accessdate= 11 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nCurtis had rescued a further 357 officers and men, who thus became prisoners, while in the siege lines more casualties brought up the allied total to 1,473 men for the Grand Assault, with all ten floating batteries destroyed.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=81\u201382}} The engagement was the fiercest battle of the war and many bodies washed up ashore.<ref name=Ferreiro288/> The British lost 15 killed and 68 men were wounded, nearly half of them from the Royal Artillery.

He was saved and managed to get back to the Spanish fleet.<ref name=Howe/>\n\nFor Elliot and the garrison it was a great victory and for the allies it was a brutal defeat, with their plans and hopes were in tatters. De C\u00f3rdova was heavily criticised for not coming to help the batteries, while d'Arcon and de Crillon threw accusations and recriminations at each other.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=40\u201341}} In Spain the news was met with consternation and despair.

The Spanish army formed up behind the batteries at the northern end of the Isthmus. At the same time, the Spanish ships moved across the bay, packed with more troops. However, de Crillon cancelled the assault, judging that losses would have been huge.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=295}}\n\nGibraltar remained under siege, but Spanish bombardments decreased to about 200 rounds a day as both sides knew of the impending peace treaty, for which the siege of Gibraltar would be a major factor.<ref name=Faulkner120>Faulkner p. 120</ref>\n\n==Final action==\nFrom 20 September, reports of the great French and Spanish assault on Gibraltar began to reach Paris; all were negative. By 27 September it was clear that the operation, involving more troops than had ever been in service at one time on the entire North American continent, had been a horrific disaster.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=335\u201338}} In Madrid news of the failure was received with dismay; the King was in mute despair as he read the intelligence reports at the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso|Palace of San Ildefonso]].<ref name=\"Sayer\"/> The French had done all they could to help the Spanish achieve their essential war aim, and began serious discussions on alternative exit strategies, urging Spain to offer Britain some very large concessions in return for Gibraltar.<ref>Jay, William [https://archive.org/details/lifeofjohnjaywit02jayw/page/493 The Life of John Jay] New York New York, Harper (1833), via Google Books\u2014 accessed 9 January 2008</ref>\n[[File:LuisDeC\u00f3rdovaYC\u00f3rdovaCapit\u00e1nGeneralDeLaRealArmada.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], commander of the Spanish fleet]]\n\nIn Britain the [[Admiralty]] considered plans for a major relief of Gibraltar, opting to send a larger but slower fleet, rather than a smaller, faster one. This was key to the outcome of the siege.{{Sfn|Syrett|2006|p=103}} Admiral [[Richard Howe]]'s orders were to deliver the supplies to Gibraltar and then to return to England. The fleet\u2014composed of 35 ships of the line, a large convoy of transports destined for Gibraltar, and additional convoys destined for the East and West Indies\u2014left [[Spithead]] on 11 September. Bad weather and contrary winds however meant that the British fleet did not arrive at [[Cape St. Vincent]] until 9 October.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=307}}\n\n===Capture of the ''San Miguel''===\nOn 10 October a storm wreaked havoc on the allied fleet: one ship of the line was driven aground, and another was swept through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] into the Mediterranean.<ref name=Mackesy483>Mackesy, p. 483</ref> One other, the Spanish ship of the line [[Spanish ship San Miguel (1773)|''San Miguel'']], of seventy two guns, under the command of Don Juan Moreno, lost its [[Mast_(sailing)#mizzen_mast|mizzen mast]] in the storm.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=309}} It was driven helplessly into Gibraltar by the storm. Cannon fire from the [[King's Bastion]] was fired at the vessel, some of which penetrated and caused damage and casualties. The ''San Miguel'' then tried with great difficulty to get out of danger but was soon grounded. Gunboats from the garrison quickly captured her. Moreno agreed to surrender to avoid any further bloodshed, being too close to the guns of Gibraltar. A total of 634 Spanish sailors, marines and dismounted dragoons were captured.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=147}}  An attempt by the Spanish and French on 17 December to bombard the ''San Miguel'' with mortars failed and caused only minimal damage. By this time the powder magazine had been removed or thrown overboard.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=157}}\n\nWith the Franco-Spanish fleet dispersed by the gale, Admiral Howe met with all his captains, and gave detailed instructions for ensuring the safe arrival of the transports. On 11 October the transports began entering the straits, followed by the covering fleet. Four transports successfully anchored at Gibraltar, but the remainder were carried by the strong currents into the Mediterranean. The British fleet followed them.<ref name=Mackesy483/> Taking advantage of a change in the wind, de C\u00f3rdova's fleet sailed in pursuit, while the Spanish admiral sent his smaller vessels to shadow the British. On 13 October, the British regrouped off the Spanish coast about 50 miles east of Gibraltar. They then sailed south towards the Moroccan coast upon the approach of the allied fleet, which failed to catch up and did not take any of the British ships.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\n===Third and final relief===\n[[File:Howe's relief of gibraltar.jpg|thumb|''Relief of Gibraltar by Earl Howe, 11 October 1782'', by [[Richard Paton]].

The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot, bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000.{{Sfn|Syrett|2006|pp=104\u20135}}{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=23}} The large combined Franco-Spanish fleet hovered nearby, so on 20 October the British fleet, without seriously engaging for battle, [[Battle of Cape Spartel|lured them away]].

Four days later a Spanish vessel flying a flag of truce brought news of the preliminary treaty, the terms of which allowed Britain to remain in possession of Gibraltar. By the end of February, French and Spanish troops retired disheartened and defeated, after three years, seven months and twelve days of conflict.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=340}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:1793 Main Street after the Siege by Captain Davis.jpg|thumb|Main Street after the siege looking South]]\nThe victorious British garrison during the three years of siege had sustained a loss of 333 killed{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=89}} and 1008 wounded, which included 219 of the garrison's gunners.<ref name=\"SOG\"/> Between 536{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=374}} and 1,034 men died or were sick from disease.<ref name=Clodfelter/> In addition, 196 civilian employees were killed and 800 died of disease.<ref name=Clodfelter/> Between 12 April 1781 and 2 February 1783 Gibraltar was hit by 244,104 artillery rounds from guns ashore and 14,283 from cannon afloat.<ref name=\"SOG\"/> The guns of the defenders had fired 200,600 rounds and British ships had hurled another 4,782 shells{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=374}} and in total had expended 8,000 barrels of gunpowder.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=89}} The besiegers had lost in excess of 6,000 killed or wounded,<ref name=Clodfelter/> with many others sick or dead from disease.

Many British regiments engaged in the defence were given the [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|badge of the Castle of Gibraltar]] with the motto \"Montis Insignia Calpe\", in commemoration of the gallant part they took in the \"Great Siege\". The failure of the floating batteries reduced General d'Arcon to despair, and he was deeply resentful of the failure for the rest of his life, printing a vindication in 1783 under the title \"M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du si\u00e8ge de Gibraltar, par l\u2019auteur des batteries flottantes\".<ref name=\"Sayer\"/>\n\nSoon after the siege the town of Gibraltar was reconstructed, the defences strengthened, and bastions constructed. The tunnelling continued after the siege and a series of connecting galleries and communication tunnels to link them together with the Lines were built.

[[Gibraltar]] from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]].\n\nThe British garrison under [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Eliott]] were blockaded from June 1779 to February 1783{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=340}}, initially by the Spanish alone, led by [[Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor]]. The blockade failed because two relief convoys entered unmolested\u2014the first under Admiral [[George Rodney]] in 1780 and the second under Admiral [[George Darby]] in 1781\u2014despite the presence of the Spanish fleets. The same year, a major assault was planned by the Spanish, but the Gibraltar garrison [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortied]] in November and destroyed much of the forward batteries. With the siege going nowhere and constant Spanish failures, the besiegers were reinforced by French forces under [[Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon|de Crillon]], who took over command in early 1782. After a lull in the siege, during which the allied force gathered more guns, ships and troops, a \"Grand Assault\" was launched on 18 September 1782. This involved huge numbers\u201460,000 men, 49 ships of the line and ten specially designed, newly invented [[Floating battery|floating batteries]]\u2014against the 5,000 defenders. The assault was a disastrous failure, resulting in heavy losses for the Bourbon allies.\n\nThe siege then settled down again to more of a blockade, but the final defeat for the allies came when a crucial British relief convoy under Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] slipped through the blockading fleet and arrived at the garrison in October 1782. The siege was finally lifted on 7 February 1783 and was a decisive victory for the British forces, being a vital factor in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]], which had been negotiated towards the end of the siege.<ref>Faulkner p xix</ref>{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|bc}}\n\nThis was the largest action fought during the war in terms of numbers, particularly the \"Grand Assault\". At three years and seven months, it is the longest [[siege]] endured by the [[British Armed Forces]] and one of the longest sieges in history.<ref name=\"Adkins\">Adkins p. 21</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Gibraltar and Bay map 1750.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A 1750 print of the Bay of Gibraltar]]\n\nIn 1738 a dispute between Spain and Great Britain arose over commerce between Europe and [[the Americas]]. Initially, both sides intended to sign an agreement at the Spanish [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], but in January of the following year, the [[British Parliament]] rejected the advice of Foreign Minister [[Robert Walpole]], a supporter of the agreement with Spain.<ref name=\"Sayer9\">{{cite book|last1=Sayer|first1=Frederick|title=The History of Gibraltar and of Its Political Relation to Events in Europe: From the Commencement of the Moorish Dynasty in Spain to the Last Morocco War|date=1862|publisher=Saunders, Otley, and Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_68cNAAAAQAAJ/page/n25 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_68cNAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> A short time later, the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] began, and both countries declared war on 23 October 1739, each side drawing up plans to establish trenches near Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Richmond\">Richmond p.9</ref> Seeing these first movements, Britain ordered [[Edward Vernon|Admiral Vernon]] to sail from [[Portobelo, Panama|Portobello]] and strengthen the squadron of [[Nicholas Haddock|Admiral Haddock]] who was already stationed in the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"Harding\">Harding p. 39</ref>\n\nThe passage of years failed to break the hostilities in the region. Then on 9 July 1746, [[King Philip V of Spain]] died in [[Madrid]]. His successor, [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]], soon began negotiations with Britain on trade. The British Parliament was amenable to such negotiations, and even looked favourably upon lifting the British [[embargo]] on Spain and possibly ceding Gibraltar. The neutrality adopted by Ferdinand VI quickly ended with his death in 1759. The new king, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], was less willing to negotiate with Great Britain. Instead, he signed a [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] with [[Louis XV of France]] on 15 August 1761. At that time France was at war with Britain, so Britain responded by declaring war on Spain and capturing the Spanish colonial capitals of [[Manila]] and [[Havana]]. Two years later, after cessation of hostilities, Spain recovered Manila and Havana in exchange for [[Spanish Florida|Spanish holdings in Florida]] as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]].<ref name=\"Simms\">Simms p. 496</ref>\n\nIn the years of peace that followed both France and Spain hoped for an opportunity to launch a war against Britain on more favourable terms and recover their lost colonial possessions.  Following the outbreak of the [[American War of Independence]], both states supplied funding and arms to the American rebels, and drew up a strategy to intervene on the American side and defeat Britain.{{Sfn|Harvey|2001|p=362}}\n\nIn October 1778 France entered the war and on 12 April 1779, both France and Spain signed the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] wherein they agreed to aid one another in recovering lost territory from Britain.<ref>{{Citation|last=Clarfield|first=Gerard|title=United States Diplomatic History: From Revolution to Empire|place=New Jersey|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1992}}.</ref> France and Spain sought to secure Gibraltar, which was a key link in Britain's control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and expected its capture to be relatively quick\u2014a precursor to a Franco-Spanish invasion of Great Britain.<ref name=\"c1\">{{cite web|url = http://www.keepmilitarymuseum.org/gibraltar.php?&dx=1&ob=3 |title=The Great Siege of Gibraltar|publisher=The Keep Military Museum|accessdate =6 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Opposing forces===\n{| style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Mart\u00edn Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Soto-Flores, conde de Colomera (Museo del Prado).jpg|</center><br>Mart\u00edn Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor\u2014[[Spanish army]] commander\nFile:George Augustus Eliott, Baron Heathfield.jpg|<center><br />[[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield]]\u2014British [[Governor of Gibraltar]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe Spanish blockade was to be directed by [[Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor]].

He established his base in [[Algeciras]], with a fleet of several [[xebec]]s and [[gunboat]]s.{{Sfn|Montero|1860|p=338}} A fleet of 11 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and two [[frigate]]s were placed in the [[Gulf of Cadiz]] under the command of [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]] to block the passage of British reinforcements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Jack|title=Gibraltar besieged, 1779\u20131783|date=1965|publisher=Heinemann|page=106|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bs0gAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\nThe British garrison in 1778 consisted of 5,382 soldiers; [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|General Eliott]] was the [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governor-General]]. All the defences were strengthened; the main physical task facing Eliott was an extensive building programme of new fortifications for Gibraltar, as set out in a report by a commission that had examined the state of the Rock's defences in the early 1770s. The most prominent new work was the [[King's Bastion]] designed by [[Sir William Green, 1st Baronet|Sir William Green]] and built by the [[Soldier Artificer Company]] on the main waterfront of the town in Gibraltar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gates & Fortifications \u2013 King's Bastion|url=http://www.aboutourrock.com/sites/fortifications.htm|publisher=aboutourrock.com|access-date=30 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101022932/http://www.aboutourrock.com/sites/fortifications.htm|archive-date=1 November 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The King's Bastion comprised a stone battery holding 26 heavy guns and mortars, with barracks and [[casemate]]s to house a full battalion of foot. The [[Grand Battery, Gibraltar|Grand Battery]] protected the [[Landport (Gibraltar)|Land Port Gate]], the main entrance to Gibraltar from the isthmus connecting to the Spanish mainland. Other fortifications and batteries crowded along the town's waterfront and on the Rock.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=53}}\n\nEliott began a programme of increasing the number of guns deployed in the batteries and fortifications, which initially stood at 412, many of them inoperable. Many of the infantry assisted the artillery in serving the guns. The garrison included three battalions of [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] and around 80 [[Corsica]]n troops. Eliott also formed a [[corps]] of [[sharpshooter]]s. The navy had only a token force; most of the sailors and marines were used on shore, but one ship of the line, [[HMS Panther (1758)|HMS ''Panther'']], was being used as a [[Hulk (ship type)|hulk]] and [[floating battery]]. The frigate [[HMS Enterprise (1774)|HMS ''Enterprise'']] and 12 gunboats were also present.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=40}} Elliott's determined handling of the preparations inspired all the troops under him with the greatest confidence. The British had anticipated an attack for some time, and many ships had sailed to reinforce and supply Gibraltar.{{Sfn|Sugden|2004|pp=109\u201310}} Britain stepped up preparations after France entered the conflict in 1778, although the French were initially more concerned with sending forces to America, and it was not until Spain joined the war that the long-expected siege commenced.{{Sfn|Harvey|2001|pp=385\u201387}}\n\n==Siege==\n[[File:Vue perspective du siege de Gibraltar commence en 1779 par les Espagnols.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of Gibraltar under siege from Spanish fleet and land positions in foreground]]\n\nOn 16 June 1779, the Spanish issued what was in effect a declaration of war against Great Britain, and a blockade immediately commenced. On 6 July 1779, an engagement took place between the British ships and Spanish vessels bringing supplies to the Spanish troops on shore. Several Spanish vessels were taken and the hostilities began. The combined Spanish and French fleets [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army constructed [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=53}}\n\nAs the winter of 1779 came, provisions for the garrison soon became scarce. Bread was almost impossible to obtain and was not permitted to be issued except to the sick and children. [[Salt-cured meat|Salt meat]] and biscuits soon became a major part of the [[rationing|rations]], with an occasional issue of four ounces of rice each day. Fuel was exhausted, and fires were made only with difficulty, using the salt-encrusted timbers of old ships broken up in the harbour for the purpose. As a result, a violent outbreak of [[scurvy]] occurred among the troops, owing to the lack of vegetables and medicines.<ref name=\"Faulkner46\">Faulkner p. 46</ref> Eliott appealed to London for relief, but as the winter wore on rations were reduced further. Despite this, the garrison's morale remained high, and the troops continued to take their turns at various posts of duty. They had also repulsed several small testing assaults made by the Spanish and had great faith that they would receive supplies by sea, and so they endured the cold and hunger.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=38}}\n\nThe Spanish were forced to commit a greater number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned Invasion of England, owing to this and the cancellation of the [[Armada of 1779]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Alfred Temple|title=The Other Armada: The Franco-Spanish Attempt to Invade Britain in 1779|date=1960|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=217|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lt9RAQAAIAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n===First naval relief===\n[[File:Gibraltar Relieved By Sir George Rodney.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral George Rodney's relief fleet at Gibraltar with captured Spanish battleships from the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]], by [[Dominic Serres]]]]\n\nIn December 1779, a large convoy sailed from England to Gibraltar, escorted by 21 ships of the line under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]]. On their way, they encountered and captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finisterre]] on 8 January 1780. They planned to provision the Gibraltar garrison further with the goods they had captured.<ref>{{London Gazette|page=1|issue=12056|date=8 January 1780}}</ref> The Spanish soon learned of the convoy and sent a fleet under [[Juan de Langara]] to intercept it, but underestimated the escort's strength, and Langara's ships soon had to flee. Rodney caught up with and defeated the Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], taking five ships of the line and additional supplies.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|p=105}} The fleet easily penetrated the Spanish blockade and reached Gibraltar on 25 January 1780, bringing reinforcements of 1,052 men of the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot|73rd Highland regiment of foot]] under [[George Mackenzie (1741\u20131787)|George Mackenzie]] and an abundance of supplies, including the captured Spanish goods.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=100}} This greatly heartened the garrison, but as soon as Rodney's fleet left, the siege resumed.<ref name=\"Mahan450\">Mahan, pp. 450\u201351</ref>\n\nThe British defenders resisted every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault. While the two sides unceasingly exchanged shot and shell, by the end of the summer, provisions again began to run low, and scurvy began to reappear, reducing the effective strength of the garrison. Through the use of small, fast-sailing ships that ran the blockade, they were able to keep in communication with the British forces [[Invasion of Minorca (1781)|besieged]] on [[Minorca]], but that force was also low on supplies.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=103}}\n[[File:AntonioBarcel\u00f3An\u00f3nimo1848.jpg|thumb|200px|Spanish maritime commander [[Antonio Barcel\u00f3]]]]\n\nOn 7 June 1780 the two largest ships of Gibraltar, HMS ''Panther'' and HMS ''Enterprise'', were targeted within Gibraltar's harbour by Spanish [[Fire ship|fireships]].<ref name=\"Davis\">Davis pp. 183\u201387</ref> Warning shots from ''Enterprise'' alerted the garrison and soon an intense bombardment slowed the fire ships. A few were sunk but the others carried on; the Spanish fleet waited just outside the harbour for any British ships trying to escape, so seamen from ''Panther'' and ''Enterprise'' set out in [[longboat]]s, intercepted the fire ships, and towed them off course.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=116}}\n\n===Second naval relief===\nThroughout the second winter the garrison faced foes, elements, disease, and starvation. By March the situation was serious: the garrison and civilians were on weekly rations and in need of a large supply. For the Spanish the blockade was working, with the few small ships that slipped past the blockade carrying insufficient supplies.<ref name=\"Gardiner179\">Gardiner p.177\u2212179</ref>\n[[File:1783 Captain Spilsbury Map of Gibraltar Rosia and Spanish Gunboats.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Sketch of Spanish Gunboats off [[Rosia Bay]], Gibraltar]]\n\nOn 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England entered the bay, despite the Spanish fleet.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=41\u201342}} The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, for the first time in the siege opened up a terrific barrage while the stores were unloaded. Although they caused great damage to the town, the South Mole where the ships unloaded their stores was out of their reach. The civilian population of about 1,000 sailed with Darby for England on 21 April, leaving the garrison with fewer mouths to feed and allowing them to operate more freely. Again the fleet left without hindrance during the night and slipped past the blockading Spanish fleet. Provisions for the garrison were now plentiful, including black powder, guns and ammunition as well as food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Faulkner53\">Faulkner p. 53</ref>\n\nThe French and Spanish thus found it impossible to starve the garrison out. They therefore resolved to make further attacks by land and sea and assembled a large army and fleet to carry this out. In addition, the Spanish built a succession of new batteries across the isthmus:{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=186}} soon there were four of them each containing around fourteen guns. There were also the preexisting San Carlos, San Felipe, and Santa Barbara batteries, each containing around 24 to 27 guns.\n\nOn 9 June, the British gunners hit a major Spanish magazine, which exploded. The main explosion was followed by a host of minor ones, as expense magazines, subsidiary stores and shells blew up. The Spanish lines were in pandemonium as the troops struggled to put out the numerous fires that started in their camp. Eventually order was restored and the fires failed to halt the Spanish effort of battery building. By late 1781 there were around fifty mortars, bringing the besiegers' total to 114 guns, ranging from heavy 24 pounders to twelve-inch mortars.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n===Sortie===\nBy November, just as hunger began to start again for the garrison, they received word from some Spanish deserters that a massive assault was planned. General Eliott decided that a night [[sortie]] to attack the Spanish and French on the eve of their assault would be the perfect move.<ref name=Faulkner59>Faulkner pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n[[File:1871 - The Sortie.jpg|thumb|700px|thumb|center|A detailed view of the sortie from above the [[Prince's Lines]]]]\n\nOn 27 November 1781, the night before they were to launch the grand attack, the British made their surprise sortie. In all 2,435 soldiers with 99 officers were involved, organised into three columns of around 700\u2013800 men each\u2014\u2014they included engineers and pioneers who were armed with axes and firing equipment.<ref name=Faulkner59/> At around 2:00 they marched towards the besiegers' lines. The right column came across the Spanish sentries at the end of the parallel, charged, and stormed the lines, bayoneting the Spanish defenders. While the rest of the defenders retreated, the eastern flank of the Spanish advanced works was taken and consolidated.<ref name=Davis/> One detachment of the right column, a group of Hanoverians, got lost in the dark, mistook its target and found themselves at the base of the huge San Carlos mortar battery.<ref>\n{{cite book| last= Grant| first= James| title= British battles on land and sea, Volume 2| date= 1873| publisher= Cassell| pages= 181\u201382| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ykkBAAAAQAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\nHaving realised their mistake, they decided to attack the position, and after some heavy fighting the position was taken. This battery had been the intended target of the centre column, which came up and reinforced the position and prepared for a Spanish counterattack. Meanwhile the left column struck along the seashore meeting light resistance; the flank companies of the 73rd Highlanders charged ahead and stormed the San Pascual and the San Martin batteries and took the trenches, putting the Spanish to flight.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=49}}\n[[File:Spanish Grenadier Napoles.jpg|thumb|200px|A Spanish Grenadier of the Napoles regiment]]\n[[File:73rdFootOfficer.jpg|thumb|left|220px|An officer of the 73rd Highlanders]]<!-- [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot]]???-->\n\nElliot decided to come out and view the victory, much to the surprise of the British officers. A badly wounded Spanish artillery officer [[Jos\u00e9 de Barboza]] refused to be moved \u2014\u2013 Elliot tried to persuade him but he asked to be \"left alone and perish amid the ruin of my post\". This would be an inspiration for a painting by John Trumbull.<ref name=Hoock>Hoock p. 114</ref> With all the Spanish forward positions secured, the British set upon the destruction of provisions, ammunition, weapons, defensive structures, taking booty and [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiking]] the guns. They set fire to the ammunition and the siege works were engulfed in flames. Soon after, Spanish cavalry were observed coming up; they faced a Hanoverian battalion but did not charge. The Spanish under Alvarez had no plans and were neither expecting nor prepared for a British sortie.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nWith the objective completed, the British withdrew back inside their fortifications. The total British and Hanoverian casualties in the sortie were two killed and 25 wounded. Spanish losses were over 100 men, which included thirty prisoners; a number of these were blue-coated Walloon soldiers of the [[Walloon Guards]].<ref name=Faulkner69>Faulkner p. 69</ref> The British did damage to the extent of two million pounds to the besiegers: fourteen months of work by the Spanish and a considerable quantity of ammunition had been destroyed. British troops and pioneers spiked ten thirteen-inch mortars and eighteen twenty-six-pounder guns in the Spanish siege works. In addition the platforms and beds on which the guns were based were also destroyed. As the British returned after their victorious sortie the garrison watched in amazement as huge explosions from the ammunition ripped through the Spanish lines and destroyed what was left of them.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=216}}\n[[File:Koehler's Depressing Carriage.jpg|thumb|300px|Koehler's Depressing Carriage]]\n\nThis sortie postponed the great Spanish assault for several months. In that time the British began building an [[Great Siege Tunnels|extensive tunnel network]] through the Rock of Gibraltar. The work was carried out by hand aided by [[gunpowder]] blasts, which was dangerous. It took thirteen men five weeks to dig a tunnel with a width of {{convert|8|sqft|m2}} and a length of {{convert|82|ft|m}}. [[Embrasure]]s were blasted overlooking the Spanish lines. Additionally, a new type of cannon mount was invented that allowed a cannon to fire at a downward angle. The [[Koehler Depressing Carriage|new depressing gun-carriage]] was devised by [[George Koehler]] which allowed guns to be fired down a slope.<ref name=Faulkner68>Faulkner p. 68</ref> This was demonstrated on 15 February 1782 at [[Princess Royal's Battery]].<ref>Red Plaque in [[Grand Casemates Square]].</ref> This new carriage enabled the defending guns to take advantage of the height of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]: they could strike out far, but also be angled downward to fire on approaching attackers.<ref name=ff29>Finlayson p.29</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of March news of the surrender of the Minorca garrison was received and lowered morale for the besieged. The Spanish and French at Gibraltar would soon be reinforced by the victors of Minorca.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=224}} Life however in Gibraltar was able to carry on with relief from merchants who ran the Spanish blockade. British ships arrived unmolested to bring in reinforcements, taking away the sick, prisoners and civilians. Portuguese vessels with [[lemon]]s, wine and vegetables helped the garrison, and gave valuable intelligence on the Spanish lines and the heavy casualties suffered from the British guns. News of HMS ''Success'''s [[Action of 16 March 1782|defeat]] of a Spanish frigate ''Santa Catalina'' bought much rejoicing to the rock when she entered.<ref name=Gardiner167>Gardiner p.167\u2212170</ref>\n\n===Arrival of the French===\n[[File:Luis Berton de Balbe de Quiers, duque de Crillon.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon|De Crillon]], the French commander, who took over operations at Gibraltar.]]\n\nSoon after the surrender of Minorca, French forces from that siege arrived to help the Spanish at Gibraltar. In particular, French engineers and pioneers were brought in, and [[Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon]] took over from \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor as commander of the besiegers, with the final say in operations. \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor was effectively demoted to take command of the Spanish contingent. Both the Spanish and the French hoped for more imaginative concepts and arrangements to bring about victory. French ships joined de C\u00f3rdova's already powerful Spanish navy to strengthen the blockade. During this time it was decided to construct the special floating batteries, and soon the British garrison observed hulks being brought into the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|p=287}} The American diplomat [[Louis Littlepage]] acted as a volunteer aide to de Crillon during the siege and made sketches of the operations.<ref name=\"Howe\">{{cite book|last1=[[Henry Howe|Howe, Henry]]|title=Adventures and Achievements of Americans: A Series of Narratives Illustrating Their Heroism, Self-reliance, Genius and Enterprise|date=1858|publisher=Geo.

A new Spanish battery, the Mahon, was erected in quick time, despite being hit many times by the British siege guns, which caused severe losses. Elliot though did not strike once it had been finished in April 1782.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|pp=244\u201346}}\n\nA lull in the siege then occurred, with each side not knowing when the other would bombard; this went on through the summer. On 11 June, a Spanish shell exploded inside the magazine of [[Princess Anne's Battery]] further up the Rock, causing a massive explosion that blew the flank of the battery into the [[Prince's Lines]], killing 14 soldiers.<ref name=\"connolly\">{{cite book|title=History of the Royal Sappers and Miners: from the formation of the Corps in March 1772, to the date when its designation was changed to that of Royal Engineers, in October 1856, Volume 1|year=1857|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0XzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=|author=Connolly, Thomas William John|edition=2|pages=16, 23}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of Spanish batteries ===\nIn early September the Spanish advanced their lines further, right up to the British siege guns' effective range. Elliot suggested to his artillery general Boyd to bombard the lines with red-hot shot and grapeshot, which had been used to great effect against Spanish gunboats daring to come close to make an attack. These \"hot potatoes\", as they were nicknamed, were pre-heated to furnace temperatures before being fired at the dry wooden defences.<ref name=Bond25>Bond, p. 25</ref>\n\nAt 7&nbsp;am on 8 September 1782 the bombardment commenced, concentrating mainly on the western parallel of the Spanish siege works. Supporting the heavy guns were the field artillery and other types of British guns. Within a few hours of intense bombardment the results became apparent and soon exceeded the garrison's expectations.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=64\u201365}} The Mahon battery along with conjoining works were set on fire.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|p=309}} The other batteries San Carlos and San Martin were heavily damaged and had to be partly dismantled by French and Spanish pioneers.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=272}}\n\nThe bombardment was a huge success and had inflicted great damage: Spanish and French casualties numbered at least 280.

Ideas were put forward to break the siege once and for all. The plan was proposed that a squadron of battery ships should take on the British land-based batteries and pound them into submission by numbers and weight of shots fired, before a storming party attacked from the siege works on the Isthmus and further troops were put ashore from the waiting Spanish fleet.<ref name=Faulkner102>Faulkner p. 102</ref> The French engineer [[Jean Le Michaud d'Ar\u00e7on]] invented and designed the floating batteries\u2014\u2018unsinkable\u2019 and \u2018unburnable\u2019\u2014intended to attack from the sea in tandem with other batteries bombarding the British from land.

Guns were to be fired from one side only; the starboard battery was removed completely and the port battery heavily augmented with timber and sand infill. The ten floating batteries would be supported by ships of the line and [[bomb ships]], which would try to draw away and split up the British fire. Five batteries each with two rows of guns together with five smaller batteries each with a single row would provide a total of 150 guns.<ref name=Faulkner102/> The Spanish enthusiastically received the proposal. D'Arcon sailed close to shore under enemy fire in a skiff to get more accurate intelligence.<ref name=Bond28/>\n[[File:Le Michaud d'Ar\u00e7on.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jean Le Michaud d'Ar\u00e7on]], French engineer and designer of the floating batteries]]\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5,260 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138{{Sfn|Monti|1852|p=140}} to 212 heavy guns, and with Don Buenaventura Moreno commanding.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=67}} Also in support were the combined Spanish and French fleet, which consisted of 49 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels, manned by a total of 30,000 sailors and marines<ref name=Bond28>Bond, pp. 28\u201329</ref> under the command of Spanish Admiral [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova|Luis de C\u00f3rdova]].<ref name=Faulkner104>Faulkner p. 104</ref>{{Sfn|Monti|1852|p=138}} They were supported by 86 land guns{{Sfn |Monti |1852| p=138}} and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000{{Sfn|Monti|1852|p=132}}\u20138,000{{Sfn|Montero|1860|p=356}} French) on land, intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=76|ps=:'35,000 allied troops camped outside'}} An 'army' of over 80,000 spectators thronged the adjacent hills on the Spanish side, expecting to see the fortress beaten to powder and 'the [[Union Flag|British flag]] trailed in the dust'. Among them were the highest families in the land, including the [[Charles X of France|Comte D'Artois]].{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=65}} \n\nThe batteries slowly moved forward along the bay; one by one the 138 guns opened fire, but soon events did not go according to plan. The alignments were not correct; the two lead ships ''Pastora'' and the ''Tala Piedra'' moved further ahead than they should have.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=335\u201338}} When they opened fire on their main target, the King's Battery, the British guns replied but the cannonballs were observed to bounce off their hulls.

This caused some casualties and damage, but by noon the artificers had heated up [[Heated shot|red-hot shot]]. Once the shot were ready, Elliot ordered them to be fired. Heated shot was actually quicker to load since it did not need to be rammed.{{cn|date=July 2019}}{{why|date=July 2019}} At first the heated shot made no difference, as many were doused on board the floating batteries.<ref name=Bond28/>\n[[File:Vue du siege de Gibraltar et explosion des batteries flottantes 1782.jpeg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|Grand Assault on Gibraltar showing the allied lines and a detonation of one the floating batteries]]\n\nAlthough the batteries had anchored, a number had soon grounded and began to suffer damage to the rigging and masts. The King's Bastion blasted away at the closest ships, the ''Pastora'' and the ''Talla Peidra'', and soon the British guns began to have effect. Smoke was spotted coming from ''Talla Piedra'', already severely damaged with its rigging in tatters.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=335\u201338}} Panic ensued since no vessel could come and support her; nor was there any way of the ship escaping.

Despite efforts to find the cause, the sailors on board were fighting a losing battle.<ref name=Faulkner118>Faulkner p. 118</ref> To make matters worse, the Spanish land guns had ceased firing. It soon became apparent to de Crillon that the Spanish army had run out of powder and were already low on shot. By nightfall it was clear that the assault had failed, but worse was to come because the fire on the two batteries was out of control. To add to de Crillon's frustration, de C\u00f3rdova's ships of the line failed to move in support, and neither did Barcelo's vessels.<ref name=Bond28/> De Crillon, acknowledging defeat and not wishing to upset the Spanish by issuing demands, soon ordered the floating batteries to be scuttled and the crews rescued. Rockets were sent up from the batteries as distress signals.<ref name=Faulkner118/>\n\n=== Destruction of the floating batteries ===\nDuring this operation, [[Roger Curtis]], the British naval commander, seeing the attacking force in great danger, warned Elliot about the huge potential death toll and that something must be done. Elliot agreed and had the fleet of twelve gunboats under Curtis set out with 250 men. They headed towards the Spanish gunboats, firing as they advanced. The Spanish precipitated a quick retreat.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=79\u201380}}\n[[File:Thomas Whitcombe Batteries destruction1782c.jpg|thumb|left|The aftermath of the destruction of the floating batteries; by [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]\n\nCurtis' gunboats reached the batteries and one by one took them; but this soon turned into a rescue effort when they realised from prisoners that many men were still on board with the scuttling now taking place.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=39\u201340}} British marines then stormed the ''Pastora'', taking the men on board as prisoners and eventually pulled them off the doomed ship, having also seized the Spanish Royal Standard. As this was going on, the flames that had engulfed ''Talla Piedra'' soon reached the magazine. The ensuing explosion was tremendous, with a sound that reverberated around the bay and a huge mushroom cloud of smoke and debris that rose up in the air.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=81\u201382}} Many were killed on board but the British had few casualties. The Spanish, now in panic, all reached for the British boats by jumping in the water. Soon the ''Pastora'', engulfed in a mass of flames, followed the fate of the ''Talla Piedra'': another huge explosion ensued. This time many in the water were killed outright; a British boat was sunk and the [[coxswain]] of Curtis's boat was killed when hit by debris.<ref name=Bond28/>\n\nCurtis realised that it was unsafe to be near the flaming batteries and soon withdrew men from two more floating batteries engulfed in flame, then finally ordered a withdrawal.<ref name=Bond28/> The rescue operation was hindered further when Spanish batteries opened fire after receiving more powder and shot. Many more men drowned or were burned in the ensuing inferno; others were hit by their own artillery. The Spanish ceased fire only when the mistake was realised, but it was too late.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=39\u201340}} The rest of the Spanish batteries blew up in similar horrific style; the explosions lofted huge mushroom clouds that rose nearly 1,000 feet in the air.<ref name=Ferreiro288/> Some men were still on board and those that had jumped overboard often drowned as the vast majority couldn't swim. By the early hours of the morning only two floating batteries remained. A Spanish [[Felucca]] tried to set one on fire but was driven off by British guns. The two were promptly set alight by them and were finished in the same way as the others by the afternoon.{{Sfn|Montero|1860|pp=365\u201366}}\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG L0183.tiff|thumb|320px|Spanish flag captured during the Grand Assault in September 1782.

During the Grand Assault 40,000 rounds had been fired. Casualties in just 12 hours were heavy: 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.<ref>{{Citation| title= Bajas espa\u00f1olas de las bater\u00edas flotantes del ataque a Gibraltar el 13 de septiembre de 1782 | newspaper= Gaceta de Madrid| publisher= Todo a Babor| language= Spanish| url= http://www.todoababor.es/datos_docum/bajas-flotantes.html| accessdate= 11 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nCurtis had rescued a further 357 officers and men, who thus became prisoners, while in the siege lines more casualties brought up the allied total to 1,473 men for the Grand Assault, with all ten floating batteries destroyed.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|pp=81\u201382}} The engagement was the fiercest battle of the war and many bodies washed up ashore.<ref name=Ferreiro288/> The British lost 15 killed and 68 men were wounded, nearly half of them from the Royal Artillery.

He was saved and managed to get back to the Spanish fleet.<ref name=Howe/>\n\nFor Elliot and the garrison it was a great victory and for the allies it was a brutal defeat, with their plans and hopes were in tatters. De C\u00f3rdova was heavily criticised for not coming to help the batteries, while d'Arcon and de Crillon threw accusations and recriminations at each other.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=40\u201341}} In Spain the news was met with consternation and despair. The huge crowds that had been promised a crushing victory left the area chagrined.<ref name=Sayer>Sayer [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_68cNAAAAQAAJ/page/n409 pp. 393\u201394]</ref>\n\nOn 14 September 1782, another assault by the allies by land was planned. The Spanish army formed up behind the batteries at the northern end of the Isthmus. At the same time, the Spanish ships moved across the bay, packed with more troops. However, de Crillon cancelled the assault, judging that losses would have been huge.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=295}}\n\nGibraltar remained under siege, but Spanish bombardments decreased to about 200 rounds a day as both sides knew of the impending peace treaty, for which the siege of Gibraltar would be a major factor.<ref name=Faulkner120>Faulkner p. 120</ref>\n\n==Final action==\nFrom 20 September, reports of the great French and Spanish assault on Gibraltar began to reach Paris; all were negative. By 27 September it was clear that the operation, involving more troops than had ever been in service at one time on the entire North American continent, had been a horrific disaster.{{Sfn|Adkins|2017|pp=335\u201338}} In Madrid news of the failure was received with dismay; the King was in mute despair as he read the intelligence reports at the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso|Palace of San Ildefonso]].<ref name=\"Sayer\"/> The French had done all they could to help the Spanish achieve their essential war aim, and began serious discussions on alternative exit strategies, urging Spain to offer Britain some very large concessions in return for Gibraltar.<ref>Jay, William [https://archive.org/details/lifeofjohnjaywit02jayw/page/493 The Life of John Jay] New York New York, Harper (1833), via Google Books\u2014 accessed 9 January 2008</ref>\n[[File:LuisDeC\u00f3rdovaYC\u00f3rdovaCapit\u00e1nGeneralDeLaRealArmada.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], commander of the Spanish fleet]]\n\nIn Britain the [[Admiralty]] considered plans for a major relief of Gibraltar, opting to send a larger but slower fleet, rather than a smaller, faster one. This was key to the outcome of the siege.{{Sfn|Syrett|2006|p=103}} Admiral [[Richard Howe]]'s orders were to deliver the supplies to Gibraltar and then to return to England. The fleet\u2014composed of 35 ships of the line, a large convoy of transports destined for Gibraltar, and additional convoys destined for the East and West Indies\u2014left [[Spithead]] on 11 September. Bad weather and contrary winds however meant that the British fleet did not arrive at [[Cape St. Vincent]] until 9 October.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=307}}\n\n===Capture of the ''San Miguel''===\nOn 10 October a storm wreaked havoc on the allied fleet: one ship of the line was driven aground, and another was swept through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] into the Mediterranean.<ref name=Mackesy483>Mackesy, p. 483</ref> One other, the Spanish ship of the line [[Spanish ship San Miguel (1773)|''San Miguel'']], of seventy two guns, under the command of Don Juan Moreno, lost its [[Mast_(sailing)#mizzen_mast|mizzen mast]] in the storm.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=309}} It was driven helplessly into Gibraltar by the storm. Cannon fire from the [[King's Bastion]] was fired at the vessel, some of which penetrated and caused damage and casualties. The ''San Miguel'' then tried with great difficulty to get out of danger but was soon grounded. Gunboats from the garrison quickly captured her. Moreno agreed to surrender to avoid any further bloodshed, being too close to the guns of Gibraltar. A total of 634 Spanish sailors, marines and dismounted dragoons were captured.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=147}}  An attempt by the Spanish and French on 17 December to bombard the ''San Miguel'' with mortars failed and caused only minimal damage. By this time the powder magazine had been removed or thrown overboard.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=157}}\n\nWith the Franco-Spanish fleet dispersed by the gale, Admiral Howe met with all his captains, and gave detailed instructions for ensuring the safe arrival of the transports. On 11 October the transports began entering the straits, followed by the covering fleet. Four transports successfully anchored at Gibraltar, but the remainder were carried by the strong currents into the Mediterranean. The British fleet followed them.<ref name=Mackesy483/> Taking advantage of a change in the wind, de C\u00f3rdova's fleet sailed in pursuit, while the Spanish admiral sent his smaller vessels to shadow the British. On 13 October, the British regrouped off the Spanish coast about 50 miles east of Gibraltar. They then sailed south towards the Moroccan coast upon the approach of the allied fleet, which failed to catch up and did not take any of the British ships.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\n===Third and final relief===\n[[File:Howe's relief of gibraltar.jpg|thumb|''Relief of Gibraltar by Earl Howe, 11 October 1782'', by [[Richard Paton]].

The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot, bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000.{{Sfn|Syrett|2006|pp=104\u20135}}{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=23}} The large combined Franco-Spanish fleet hovered nearby, so on 20 October the British fleet, without seriously engaging for battle, [[Battle of Cape Spartel|lured them away]]. The Franco-Spanish van opened fire as the British under Howe formed line of battle.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> The British returned fire, while Howe signalled 'retreat all sail', making at least fourteen Franco-Spanish ships redundant.

The Spanish fleet's performance under de C\u00f3rdova was the single greatest factor in the siege's failure.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=27}}\n\n=== End of the siege ===\nNews that Gibraltar was fully resupplied with no problems for the convoy, combined with the disastrous Franco-Spanish attack of 13 September, reached London on 7 November and probably reached Paris about the same time.<ref name=\"Falkner124\"/> This greatly strengthened the British hand at the peace talks which had begun already in October 1782. British diplomats steadfastly refused to part with Gibraltar, despite offers by Spain to trade most of its gains.<ref>''The Cambridge Modern History'', pp. 6:379\u2013380</ref> The objections of Spain ceased to be of any relevance, and the French accepted the preliminary peace treaty between Great Britain and America on 30 November, with protests but no action. The siege was continued but on 20 January 1783 preliminary treaties were signed with France and Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGuffie|first1=Tom Henderson|title=The siege of Gibraltar, 1779\u20131783|date=1965|publisher=B.T.

Four days later a Spanish vessel flying a flag of truce brought news of the preliminary treaty, the terms of which allowed Britain to remain in possession of Gibraltar. By the end of February, French and Spanish troops retired disheartened and defeated, after three years, seven months and twelve days of conflict.{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=340}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:1793 Main Street after the Siege by Captain Davis.jpg|thumb|Main Street after the siege looking South]]\nThe victorious British garrison during the three years of siege had sustained a loss of 333 killed{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=89}} and 1008 wounded, which included 219 of the garrison's gunners.<ref name=\"SOG\"/> Between 536{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=374}} and 1,034 men died or were sick from disease.<ref name=Clodfelter/> In addition, 196 civilian employees were killed and 800 died of disease.<ref name=Clodfelter/> Between 12 April 1781 and 2 February 1783 Gibraltar was hit by 244,104 artillery rounds from guns ashore and 14,283 from cannon afloat.<ref name=\"SOG\"/> The guns of the defenders had fired 200,600 rounds and British ships had hurled another 4,782 shells{{Sfn|Drinkwater|1862|p=374}} and in total had expended 8,000 barrels of gunpowder.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=89}} The besiegers had lost in excess of 6,000 killed or wounded,<ref name=Clodfelter/> with many others sick or dead from disease. In addition many guns were destroyed, and the combined allied fleet lost a total of ten floating batteries, with one ship of the line and many gunboats captured. Together both sides fired nearly half a million rounds of shot during the Great Siege.<ref name=\"Falkner133\">Falkner p. 133</ref> Elliot's defence of the Rock had tied down large numbers of Spanish and French naval and military resources that could have been valuable in other theatres of operations.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=91}} The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] reaffirmed previous treaties.\n\nDespite the Spanish attempt to regain Gibraltar at the negotiating table, they ended up merely retaining Menorca and territories in Florida, though for the Spanish this was of little or no value.<ref>Lawrence S. Kaplan, \"The Treaty of Paris, 1783: A Historiographical Challenge,\" ''International History Review,'' Sept 1983, Vol. 5 Issue 3, pp 431\u2013442</ref> Of interest is that an attempt to exchange [[Puerto Rico]] for Gibraltar collapsed, as it would have brought too much competition for Jamaican products into the protected British market. The final peace treaty left Gibraltar with the British.{{Sfn|Chartrand|Courcelle|2006|p=88}}\n\nElliot was made a [[Knight of the Bath]] and was created 1st [[Baron Heathfield]] of Gibraltar. Many British regiments engaged in the defence were given the [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|badge of the Castle of Gibraltar]] with the motto \"Montis Insignia Calpe\", in commemoration of the gallant part they took in the \"Great Siege\". The failure of the floating batteries reduced General d'Arcon to despair, and he was deeply resentful of the failure for the rest of his life, printing a vindication in 1783 under the title \"M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du si\u00e8ge de Gibraltar, par l\u2019auteur des batteries flottantes\".<ref name=\"Sayer\"/>\n\nSoon after the siege the town of Gibraltar was reconstructed, the defences strengthened, and bastions constructed. The tunnelling continued after the siege and a series of connecting galleries and communication tunnels to link them together with the Lines were built.

The [[Mekong]] river, the [[list of rivers by length|twelfth longest in the world]], cuts through the middle of Cambodia. The capital [[Phnom Penh]] is on its riverbank, at the junction where two other rivers meet: the [[Tonle Sap]] and [[Bassac River|Bassac]]. The Tonle Sap river connects the Mekong with the [[Tonle Sap]] lake, or Great Lake, which acts as a liquid heart and natural reservoir for the entire Mekong river system, regulating the flow of huge volumes of water, and allowing the safe passage of an astonishing number of freshwater fish. The lake itself is believed to have more fish than any other in the world and ranks second to the [[Amazon river]] in [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Khmer Borane - amazing sampler (8532779364).jpg|left|thumb|]]\nWhen the rainy season begins at the start of the [[Khmer New Year]], the region becomes inundated with monsoonal rain and Cambodia turns into a vast ocean of emerald rice-paddies. [[Rice]] is the staple food of Cambodia, and it is part of every meal, both as an accompaniment and used as an ingredient for many dishes. According to the International Rice Research Institute, there are 2,000 rice varieties indigenous to Cambodia that were developed over centuries by Cambodian rice farmers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thaitawat |first=Nusara |date=2000 |title=The Cuisine of Cambodia |url= |location=Thailand |publisher=Nusara & Friends Co. Ltd. |page=24 |isbn=9748778851 |author-link= }}</ref> The geographical setting of wetlands (Cambodia ranks second to Bangladesh for the largest amount of wetland in Asia) and floodplains explains why water, and hence fish and rice (which grow in water) are such an integral component to the cuisine. Many dishes, in particular, the ''samlors'', have a pond-like appearance,{{clarify|date=May 2015}}{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and are often loaded with reed-like plants, leaves, and vegetables, mirroring the surrounding landscape. Dipping sauces tend to be quite watery, as are most Cambodian curries.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nKhmer cuisine shares many commonalities with the food of neighbouring [[Thailand]]\u2014although, less chilli, sugar and coconut cream are used for flavor\u2014and of neighboring [[Vietnam]], with which it shares and adopts many common dishes, as well as a colonial history, as both formed part of the [[French colonial empire]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. It has drawn upon influences from the cuisines of [[China]] and [[France]], powerful players in Cambodian history. The Chinese began arriving in the 13th century, but Chinese migration accelerated during the French period. [[Curry]] dishes, known as ''Kari'' (in Khmer, {{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u179a\u17b8}}) show a trace of cultural influence from [[India]]. The many variations of rice [[Chinese noodles|noodles]] show the influences from [[Chinese cuisine]].  The Portuguese and Spanish also had considerable influence in Cambodian affairs in the 16th century, introducing chili and peanuts into Asia from the New World. However, chili never gained the same status or prominence as it did with the cuisines of neighboring Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia. Even today very few recipes include chili.\n\n[[File:Baguettes in Kampot.jpg|thumb|Toasted baguettes for sale in [[Kampot (city)|Kampot]]]]\nOne legacy of [[French cuisine]], the [[baguette]]\u2014known as ''nom pang'' in Khmer\u2014is ubiquitous in all parts of Cambodia today. [[Cambodia]]ns often eat bread with [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]], tinned sardines or eggs. One of these with a cup of strong [[coffee]], sweetened with condensed milk, is an example of a common Cambodian [[breakfast]]. Freshly buttered baguettes can be made into sandwiches (also called ''nom pang'') and may be stuffed with slices of ham or any number of grilled meats, with [[Kampot (pepper)|Kampot pepper]], similar to Vietnamese [[banh mi]]. The French also introduced beer, butter, pate, coffee, chocolate, onions, carrots, broccoli, potatoes and many other types of non-native produce [[Southeast Asia]].\n\nTraditionally, Cambodians eat their meals with at least three or four dishes. A meal will usually include a soup, or ''samlor'', served alongside the main courses. Each individual dish will be either sweet, sour, salty or bitter in taste. Chilli (fresh, pickled or dried) and chili sauce is served on the side and left up to individual diners and to their taste. In this way, Cambodians ensure that they get a bit of every flavor to satisfy their palates.\n\n==Ingredients==\n===Fermented sauces===\n[[File:Fried Prahok meal.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Prahok]]'' fried in banana leaves with fresh green vegetables and steamed rice.]]\n[[File:Prahokktis.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Prahok]] ktis]]\nIn Khmer cuisine, a distinction is made between fermented paste-based ingredients and pickled ingredients. ''Mam'' refers to fish or shrimp that has been fermented in a particular technique and is usually includes more solid pieces of the pickled animal. ''Mam'' is the general term for most kinds of fermented ingredients created from aquatic animals. ''[[Prahok]]'' and ''[[Shrimp paste|kapi]]'' are popular bases for sauces with pickled aged ingredients. Both ''mam'' and ''prahok'' are aged for a minimum of one year in order to reach the full taste potential, much like fish sauce. Fermented sauces are often eaten with high protein-based dishes or raw vegetables to aid digestion.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\"|Name\n!Description\n|-\n|''mam'' (fermented seafood)\n|''Mam'' refers to the salted, fermented fillets of snakehead fish, to which roasted red sticky rice and palm sugar are added during the fermenting process to impart an earthier and sweeter flavour. The sugar and rice also lends the ingredient a reddish tinge. From the time that the fish is filleted, mam can take over a year to reach maturity. Mam originates from the [[Mekong Delta]] in [[Vietnam]].\n|-\n|''[[prahok]]''\n|A common ingredient, almost a national institution, is a pungent type of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[fish paste]] used in many dishes, a distinctive flavoring known as ''[[prahok]]'' ({{lang|km|\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780}}). It is an acquired taste for most [[Western world|Westerners]] and is an integral part of Khmer cuisine. It is included in many dishes or used as a dipping sauce. The liberal use of ''[[prahok]]'', which adds a salty tang to many dishes, is a characteristic which distinguishes Khmer cuisine from that of its neighbours. ''Prahok'' can be prepared many ways and eaten as a dish on its own right. ''Prahok jien'' (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u1785\u17c0\u1793) is fried and usually mixed with meat (usually beef or pork) and chili.

Daily fresh catches come from the [[Mekong River]], [[Bassac River]] and the vast [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]]. Fish is far more common than meat in Khmer cuisine. ''Prahok'' itself is based on fish. Many of the fish eaten in Cambodia are [[freshwater fish]] from the [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]] or from the [[Mekong]]. Dried salted fish known as ''trei ngeat'' ({{lang|km|\u178f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8\u1784\u17c0\u178f}}) are a favourite with plain rice porridge. The popular Khmer dish called [[amok trey]] uses a kind of [[catfish]] steamed in a savoury coconut-based curry. The small fish known as ''[[Luciosoma bleekeri|Trey Dang Dau]]'' are very common and are often eaten deep-fried.\n\nWhile freshwater fish is the most commonly used meat in the [[Cambodia]]n diet, [[pork]] and [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] are also popular. Though not as common as in neighbouring Vietnam, vegetarian food is a part of Khmer cuisine and often favoured by more observant Buddhists.\n\nPork is quite popular in making sweet Khmer sausages known as ''kwah ko'' ({{lang|km|\u178f\u17d2\u179c\u17b6\u179a\u1782\u17c4}}). Beef and chicken are stewed, grilled or stir fried. Seafood includes an array of shellfish such as crabs, clams, [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s, [[Crayfish (food)|crayfish]], shrimp and squid. Giant freshwater prawns, sometimes referred to as river lobsters, are not commonly eaten because of their price, but middle-class and rich Cambodians enjoy eating them. [[Duck (food)|Duck]] roasted in Chinese ''[[char siu]]'' style is popular during festivals.

Kuyteav may be served in one of two ways, with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions have the same ingredients and allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, temperatures and textures. The Phnom Penh version of kuy teav (called ''hu tieu Nam Vang'' by the Vietnamese) is the most extravagant, often containing some or all of the following toppings: pork belly, ground pork, congealed [[blood as food#Asia|pig blood]], chopped pork offal such as intestine, heart, liver and lung, roasted duck, Mekong river prawns, fish cake and squid.

The [[Mekong]] river, the [[list of rivers by length|twelfth longest in the world]], cuts through the middle of Cambodia. The capital [[Phnom Penh]] is on its riverbank, at the junction where two other rivers meet: the [[Tonle Sap]] and [[Bassac River|Bassac]]. The Tonle Sap river connects the Mekong with the [[Tonle Sap]] lake, or Great Lake, which acts as a liquid heart and natural reservoir for the entire Mekong river system, regulating the flow of huge volumes of water, and allowing the safe passage of an astonishing number of freshwater fish. The lake itself is believed to have more fish than any other in the world and ranks second to the [[Amazon river]] in [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Khmer Borane - amazing sampler (8532779364).jpg|left|thumb|]]\nWhen the rainy season begins at the start of the [[Khmer New Year]], the region becomes inundated with monsoonal rain and Cambodia turns into a vast ocean of emerald rice-paddies. [[Rice]] is the staple food of Cambodia, and it is part of every meal, both as an accompaniment and used as an ingredient for many dishes. According to the International Rice Research Institute, there are 2,000 rice varieties indigenous to Cambodia that were developed over centuries by Cambodian rice farmers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thaitawat |first=Nusara |date=2000 |title=The Cuisine of Cambodia |url= |location=Thailand |publisher=Nusara & Friends Co.

Many dishes, in particular, the ''samlors'', have a pond-like appearance,{{clarify|date=May 2015}}{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and are often loaded with reed-like plants, leaves, and vegetables, mirroring the surrounding landscape. Dipping sauces tend to be quite watery, as are most Cambodian curries.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nKhmer cuisine shares many commonalities with the food of neighbouring [[Thailand]]\u2014although, less chilli, sugar and coconut cream are used for flavor\u2014and of neighboring [[Vietnam]], with which it shares and adopts many common dishes, as well as a colonial history, as both formed part of the [[French colonial empire]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. It has drawn upon influences from the cuisines of [[China]] and [[France]], powerful players in Cambodian history. The Chinese began arriving in the 13th century, but Chinese migration accelerated during the French period. [[Curry]] dishes, known as ''Kari'' (in Khmer, {{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u179a\u17b8}}) show a trace of cultural influence from [[India]]. The many variations of rice [[Chinese noodles|noodles]] show the influences from [[Chinese cuisine]].  The Portuguese and Spanish also had considerable influence in Cambodian affairs in the 16th century, introducing chili and peanuts into Asia from the New World. However, chili never gained the same status or prominence as it did with the cuisines of neighboring Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia. Even today very few recipes include chili.\n\n[[File:Baguettes in Kampot.jpg|thumb|Toasted baguettes for sale in [[Kampot (city)|Kampot]]]]\nOne legacy of [[French cuisine]], the [[baguette]]\u2014known as ''nom pang'' in Khmer\u2014is ubiquitous in all parts of Cambodia today. [[Cambodia]]ns often eat bread with [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]], tinned sardines or eggs. One of these with a cup of strong [[coffee]], sweetened with condensed milk, is an example of a common Cambodian [[breakfast]]. Freshly buttered baguettes can be made into sandwiches (also called ''nom pang'') and may be stuffed with slices of ham or any number of grilled meats, with [[Kampot (pepper)|Kampot pepper]], similar to Vietnamese [[banh mi]]. The French also introduced beer, butter, pate, coffee, chocolate, onions, carrots, broccoli, potatoes and many other types of non-native produce [[Southeast Asia]].\n\nTraditionally, Cambodians eat their meals with at least three or four dishes. A meal will usually include a soup, or ''samlor'', served alongside the main courses. Each individual dish will be either sweet, sour, salty or bitter in taste. Chilli (fresh, pickled or dried) and chili sauce is served on the side and left up to individual diners and to their taste. In this way, Cambodians ensure that they get a bit of every flavor to satisfy their palates.\n\n==Ingredients==\n===Fermented sauces===\n[[File:Fried Prahok meal.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Prahok]]'' fried in banana leaves with fresh green vegetables and steamed rice.]]\n[[File:Prahokktis.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Prahok]] ktis]]\nIn Khmer cuisine, a distinction is made between fermented paste-based ingredients and pickled ingredients. ''Mam'' refers to fish or shrimp that has been fermented in a particular technique and is usually includes more solid pieces of the pickled animal. ''Mam'' is the general term for most kinds of fermented ingredients created from aquatic animals. ''[[Prahok]]'' and ''[[Shrimp paste|kapi]]'' are popular bases for sauces with pickled aged ingredients. Both ''mam'' and ''prahok'' are aged for a minimum of one year in order to reach the full taste potential, much like fish sauce. Fermented sauces are often eaten with high protein-based dishes or raw vegetables to aid digestion.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\"|Name\n!Description\n|-\n|''mam'' (fermented seafood)\n|''Mam'' refers to the salted, fermented fillets of snakehead fish, to which roasted red sticky rice and palm sugar are added during the fermenting process to impart an earthier and sweeter flavour. The sugar and rice also lends the ingredient a reddish tinge. From the time that the fish is filleted, mam can take over a year to reach maturity. Mam originates from the [[Mekong Delta]] in [[Vietnam]].\n|-\n|''[[prahok]]''\n|A common ingredient, almost a national institution, is a pungent type of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[fish paste]] used in many dishes, a distinctive flavoring known as ''[[prahok]]'' ({{lang|km|\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780}}). It is an acquired taste for most [[Western world|Westerners]] and is an integral part of Khmer cuisine. It is included in many dishes or used as a dipping sauce. The liberal use of ''[[prahok]]'', which adds a salty tang to many dishes, is a characteristic which distinguishes Khmer cuisine from that of its neighbours. ''Prahok'' can be prepared many ways and eaten as a dish on its own right. ''Prahok jien'' (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u1785\u17c0\u1793) is fried and usually mixed with meat (usually beef or pork) and chili. It can be eaten with dips, vegetables like cucumbers or eggplants, and rice. ''Prahok gop'' or ''prahok ang'' (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u1780\u1794\u17cb) or (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u17a2\u17b6\u17c6\u1784) is covered with banana leaves and left to cook under a fire under pieces of rock or over the coals. When ''prahok'' is not used, ''kap\u01d0'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u1796\u17b7}}), a kind of fermented shrimp paste, is used instead. Khmer cuisine also uses [[fish sauce]] widely in soups and stir-fried dishes, and as a dipping sauce.\n|-\n|''[[shrimp paste|kapi]]''\n|Another common ingredient in Khmer cuisine, this fermented shrimp paste is often mixed with garlic and chili peppers and used as a dipping sauces for grilled and fried meats.

Daily fresh catches come from the [[Mekong River]], [[Bassac River]] and the vast [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]]. Fish is far more common than meat in Khmer cuisine. ''Prahok'' itself is based on fish. Many of the fish eaten in Cambodia are [[freshwater fish]] from the [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]] or from the [[Mekong]]. Dried salted fish known as ''trei ngeat'' ({{lang|km|\u178f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8\u1784\u17c0\u178f}}) are a favourite with plain rice porridge. The popular Khmer dish called [[amok trey]] uses a kind of [[catfish]] steamed in a savoury coconut-based curry. The small fish known as ''[[Luciosoma bleekeri|Trey Dang Dau]]'' are very common and are often eaten deep-fried.\n\nWhile freshwater fish is the most commonly used meat in the [[Cambodia]]n diet, [[pork]] and [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] are also popular. Though not as common as in neighbouring Vietnam, vegetarian food is a part of Khmer cuisine and often favoured by more observant Buddhists.\n\nPork is quite popular in making sweet Khmer sausages known as ''kwah ko'' ({{lang|km|\u178f\u17d2\u179c\u17b6\u179a\u1782\u17c4}}). Beef and chicken are stewed, grilled or stir fried. Seafood includes an array of shellfish such as crabs, clams, [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s, [[Crayfish (food)|crayfish]], shrimp and squid. Giant freshwater prawns, sometimes referred to as river lobsters, are not commonly eaten because of their price, but middle-class and rich Cambodians enjoy eating them. [[Duck (food)|Duck]] roasted in Chinese ''[[char siu]]'' style is popular during festivals. More unusual varieties of meat include frog, turtle, and arthropods (including [[Fried spider|tarantulas]]) as well as insects such as crickets; these are difficult to find in Khmer cuisine abroad but are used in everyday dishes in Cambodia.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Beef]] (''Sach Ko'')\n* [[Pork]] (''Sach Chrouk'')\n* [[Char siu]] (''Chha Chiu'' or ''Sa See'')\n* [[Siu mei]] (''Kvai'')\n* [[Frog]] (''Kon Kaeb'')\n* [[Naem]] - Fermented Sour Sausage (''Nem'')\n* [[Rice Paper]]- Rice Paper wrapper (''Num Naem Chhao'')\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Chicken]] (''Sach Moan'')\n* [[Jiaozi]] (''Kiev'')\n* [[Shumai]] (''Siev Mai'')\n* [[Duck]] (''Sach Tia'')\n* [[Snail]] (''Khyang'')\n* [[P\u00e2t\u00e9]] (''Pat Tae'')\n* [[Spring roll]]- Wheat-based pastry wrapper (''Num Cha yor'')\n\n{{col-3}}\n\n* [[Fish]] (''Trey'')\n* [[Water buffalo]] (''Sach Krabey'')\n* [[Tarantula]] (''Ping Pieng Chien'')\n* [[Crocodile]] (''Sach Krapeu'')\n* [[Sausage]] (''Kwah Sach'' or ''Sach Krok'')\n* [[Eggs (food)|Eggs]] (''Pong'')\n* [[Popiah]]- Chaozhou/Fujian spring roll wrapper (''Num Por Pear'')\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Noodles===\n[[File:Mee Kola.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Mee Kola'', a vegetarian noodle dish]]\nMany elements of Cambodian noodle dishes were inspired by Chinese and Vietnamese cooking<ref name=\"TWWG\">The Worldwide Gourmet [http://www.theworldwidegourmet.com/countries/asia/cambodia.htm Saveurs du Cambodge ''All you want to know about Cambodian Cuisine'']  Accessed 21 July 2007.</ref> despite maintaining a distinct Khmer variation.

This traditional pork broth-based rice noodle soup dish is a popular breakfast dish in Cambodia and is popular in neighbouring countries and in countries that have a large Khmer population. Originally developed by Cambodians of Chinese descent, it is always served with the garnishes of [[lettuce]] leaves, bean sprouts, chopped [[scallion]]s, sawtooth coriander, black Kampot pepper, lime juice, and caramelised garlic oil. Kuyteav may be served in one of two ways, with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions have the same ingredients and allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, temperatures and textures. The Phnom Penh version of kuy teav (called ''hu tieu Nam Vang'' by the Vietnamese) is the most extravagant, often containing some or all of the following toppings: pork belly, ground pork, congealed [[blood as food#Asia|pig blood]], chopped pork offal such as intestine, heart, liver and lung, roasted duck, Mekong river prawns, fish cake and squid. Modern versions of kuyteav featuring beef, chicken, or seafood (rather than the original pork-based broth) have evolved recently, but the plethora of garnishes that distinguish kuyteav remain the same.\n|-\n| ''[[Kuy teav|Kuy teav Ko Kho]]'' (caramelized rice noodles)\n| A rice noodle dish created from the stewed/braised flavors of beef combined with flat rice noodle.

Variations often served with yellow wheat noodle and a mixture of rice wheat and rice noodle (''Kuy teav Mee Kiev''). \n|-\n| ''[[Rice vermicelli|Num banh chok]]'' (meaning rice noodle)\n| A well-known and beloved Cambodian dish found at streetside vendors, restaurants, produce markets (''psahs'') such as the Psah Thom Thmey ([[Central Market, Phnom Penh]]) and in shophouses. In English it's often simply called simply Khmer noodles, owing to its ubiquity across the country. Nom ban chok is a typical breakfast food and was originally a regional speciality from Kampot province, consisting of noodles laboriously pounded out of rice, topped with a fish-based green curry gravy made from lemongrass, turmeric root and kaffir lime. Fresh mint leaves, bean sprouts, green beans, banana flower, cucumbers and other greens are heaped on top by the diner. There is also a red curry version that is usually reserved for ceremonial occasions and wedding festivities (see Samlor kari). Similar dishes exist in Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. \n|-\n| ''Num Banh Chok Somlar Kari''\n| A rice noodle dish eaten with a Khmer curry soup.

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first season revolves around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the second season, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in a tent outside of the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to help them, and the Professor is able to establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manage to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda escapes, begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo is able to regain the trust of the gang and rejoins them. Gand\u00eda shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and holding of Lisbon to the public. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred to the Supreme Court. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang within the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda |url=https://www.lavozdeasturias.es/noticia/cultura/2019/01/26/embarcadero-tenia-presion-casa-papel/0003_201901SY26P14991.htm |title=\u00c1lex Pina: \"Con 'El embarcadero' ten\u00eda m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n que con 'La Casa de Papel'\" |language=es |publisher=lavozdeasturias.es |date=4 February 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.<ref name=xataka_190705>{{cite web |last=Muela |first=Cesar |url=https://www.xataka.com/cine-y-tv/casa-papel-no-hubiera-estado-netflix-seguiriamos-diciendo-que-no-podemos-competir-series-fuera-alex-pina-creador-serie |title=\"Si 'La Casa de Papel' no hubiera estado en Netflix seguir\u00edamos diciendo que no podemos competir con las series de fuera\", \u00c1lex Pina, creador de la serie |publisher=xataka.com |language=es |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes,<ref name=xataka_190705 /> which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series<ref name=elespanol_190724 /> and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.<ref name=xataka_190705 /> Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126 /><ref name=elcomercio_190808>{{cite web |url=https://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/series/casa-papel-temporada-4-fecha-estreno-netflix-parte-4-trailer-historia-pasara-actores-personajes-money-heist-espana-ficha-tv-nnda-nnlt-noticia-650201 |title=\"La casa de papel\", temporada 4: fecha de estreno en Netflix, qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1, actores, personajes, misterios y teor\u00edas |language=es |publisher=elcomercio.pe |date=10 August 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love,<ref name=elespectador_190718>{{cite web |last=Contreras Fajardo |first=Lilian |url=https://www.elespectador.com/entretenimiento/medios/la-casa-de-papel-3-robar-oro-para-recuperar-el-amor-articulo-871675 |title=\"La Casa de Papel 3\": robar oro para recuperar el amor |publisher=elespectador.com |language=es |date=18 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> for which the series received comparisons to [[telenovela]]s.<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=theglobeandmail /> Comedic elements, which were compared to ''[[Back to the Future]]''<ref name=abc_170628>{{cite web |last=Soage |first=Noelia |url=https://www.abc.es/play/series/noticias/abci-entrevista-alvaro-morte-casa-papel-201706280112_noticia.html |title=\u00c1lvaro Morte: \"La casa de papel va a marcar un antes y un despu\u00e9s en la forma de tratar la ficci\u00f3n en este pa\u00eds\" |work=ABC|location=Spain |language=es |date=28 June 2017 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> and [[black comedy]],<ref name=elpais_190614 /> also offset the heist tension.<ref name=variety_190801 /> The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together.<ref name=haaretz_180807>{{cite web |last=Hennigan |first=Adrian |url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/television/.premium-netflix-s-money-heist-will-steal-your-heart-and-your-weekend-1.5977887 |title=Netflix's 'Money Heist' Will Steal Your Heart and Your Weekend |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=7 April 2018 |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the series being set after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], which resulted in severe austerity measures in Spain,<ref name=theglobeandmail /> critics argued that the series was an explicit allegory of rebellion against capitalism,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=lemonde_190313>{{cite web |last=S\u00e9risier |first=Pierre |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/seriestv/2018/03/13/la-casa-de-papel-allegorie-de-la-rebellion/ |title=La Casa de Papel \u2013 All\u00e9gorie de la r\u00e9bellion |language=fr |work=Le Monde |date=13 March 2018 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', who saw the series as \"subversive in that it's about a heist for the people.

She added that the amount of information and technology that surrounds us is allowing us to verify that \"everyone has a dark side.\"<ref name=huffingtonpost_190628 /> The series leaves it to the

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first season revolves around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the second season, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in a tent outside of the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to help them, and the Professor is able to establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manage to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda escapes, begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo is able to regain the trust of the gang and rejoins them. Gand\u00eda shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and holding of Lisbon to the public. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred to the Supreme Court. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang within the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda |url=https://www.lavozdeasturias.es/noticia/cultura/2019/01/26/embarcadero-tenia-presion-casa-papel/0003_201901SY26P14991.htm |title=\u00c1lex Pina: \"Con 'El embarcadero' ten\u00eda m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n que con 'La Casa de Papel'\" |language=es |publisher=lavozdeasturias.es |date=4 February 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.<ref name=xataka_190705>{{cite web |last=Muela |first=Cesar |url=https://www.xataka.com/cine-y-tv/casa-papel-no-hubiera-estado-netflix-seguiriamos-diciendo-que-no-podemos-competir-series-fuera-alex-pina-creador-serie |title=\"Si 'La Casa de Papel' no hubiera estado en Netflix seguir\u00edamos diciendo que no podemos competir con las series de fuera\", \u00c1lex Pina, creador de la serie |publisher=xataka.com |language=es |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes,<ref name=xataka_190705 /> which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series<ref name=elespanol_190724 /> and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.<ref name=xataka_190705 /> Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126 /><ref name=elcomercio_190808>{{cite web |url=https://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/series/casa-papel-temporada-4-fecha-estreno-netflix-parte-4-trailer-historia-pasara-actores-personajes-money-heist-espana-ficha-tv-nnda-nnlt-noticia-650201 |title=\"La casa de papel\", temporada 4: fecha de estreno en Netflix, qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1, actores, personajes, misterios y teor\u00edas |language=es |publisher=elcomercio.pe |date=10 August 2019 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love,<ref name=elespectador_190718>{{cite web |last=Contreras Fajardo |first=Lilian |url=https://www.elespectador.com/entretenimiento/medios/la-casa-de-papel-3-robar-oro-para-recuperar-el-amor-articulo-871675 |title=\"La Casa de Papel 3\": robar oro para recuperar el amor |publisher=elespectador.com |language=es |date=18 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> for which the series received comparisons to [[telenovela]]s.<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=theglobeandmail /> Comedic elements, which were compared to ''[[Back to the Future]]''<ref name=abc_170628>{{cite web |last=Soage |first=Noelia |url=https://www.abc.es/play/series/noticias/abci-entrevista-alvaro-morte-casa-papel-201706280112_noticia.html |title=\u00c1lvaro Morte: \"La casa de papel va a marcar un antes y un despu\u00e9s en la forma de tratar la ficci\u00f3n en este pa\u00eds\" |work=ABC|location=Spain |language=es |date=28 June 2017 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> and [[black comedy]],<ref name=elpais_190614 /> also offset the heist tension.<ref name=variety_190801 /> The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together.<ref name=haaretz_180807>{{cite web |last=Hennigan |first=Adrian |url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/television/.premium-netflix-s-money-heist-will-steal-your-heart-and-your-weekend-1.5977887 |title=Netflix's 'Money Heist' Will Steal Your Heart and Your Weekend |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=7 April 2018 |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the series being set after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], which resulted in severe austerity measures in Spain,<ref name=theglobeandmail /> critics argued that the series was an explicit allegory of rebellion against capitalism,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /><ref name=lemonde_190313>{{cite web |last=S\u00e9risier |first=Pierre |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/seriestv/2018/03/13/la-casa-de-papel-allegorie-de-la-rebellion/ |title=La Casa de Papel \u2013 All\u00e9gorie de la r\u00e9bellion |language=fr |work=Le Monde |date=13 March 2018 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', who saw the series as \"subversive in that it's about a heist for the people.

''[[El Espa\u00f1ol]]'' argued that the analogy made it easier for viewers to connect with the show, as modern society tended to be tired of banks and politics already,<ref name=elespanol_190724>{{cite web |last=Zurro |first=Javier |url=https://www.elespanol.com/cultura/series/20190724/netflix-no-tomes-pelo-casa-papel/415959462_0.html |title=Netflix, no nos tomes el pelo: 'La Casa de Papel' no es para tanto |language=es |publisher=elespanol.com|date=24 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> and ''The New Statesman'' said the rich were no longer stolen from but undermined at their roots.<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> On the other hand, [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']]'s Mireia Mullor saw the Robin Hood analogy as a mere distraction strategy for the robbers, as they initially did not plan to use the money from their first heist to improve the quality of life of regular people; for this reason, Mullor also argues that the large following for the robbers in part 3 was not comprehensible even though they represented a channel for the discontent of those bearing economic and political injustices.<ref name=esquire_190729>{{cite web |last=Mullor |first=Mireia |url=https://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/tv/a28516581/la-casa-de-papel-temporada-3-critica-netflix/ |title=\u2018La casa de papel\u2019: Los pros y contras de la tercera temporada en Netflix |language=es |work=Esquire |date=29 July 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe characters were designed as multi-dimensional and complementary [[antagonist]]s and [[anti-hero]]es whose moralities are ever-changing.<ref name=dramaquarterly_180629 /> Examples include Berlin, who shifts from a robber mistreating hostages, to one of the series' most beloved characters.<ref name=dramaquarterly_180629 /> There is also the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, as well as inspector Raquel Murillo, who eventually join the cause of the robbers.<ref name=dramaquarterly_180629 /> Gonz\u00e1lvez of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' finds that an audience may think of the robbers as evil at first for committing a crime, but as the series progresses it marks the financial system as the true evil and suggests the robbers have ethical and empathetic justification for stealing from an overpowered thief.<ref name=huffingtonpost_190628>{{cite web |last=Gonz\u00e1lvez |first=Paula M. |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.es/entry/por-que-arrasa-la-casa-de-papel-en-todo-el-mundo-cada-detalle-esta-estudiado_es_5d14ff66e4b03d6116385913 |title=Qu\u00e9 ha hecho bien 'La Casa de Papel' para convertirse en la serie de habla no inglesa m\u00e1s vista de la historia de Netflix |language=es |publisher=huffingtonpost.es |date=28 June 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> Najwa Nimri, playing inspector Sierra in part 3, said that \"the complex thing about a villain is giving him humanity.

She added that the amount of information and technology that surrounds us is allowing us to verify that \"everyone has a dark side.\"<ref name=huffingtonpost_190628 /> The series leaves it to the audience to decide who is good or bad, as characters are \"relatable and immoral\" at various points in the story.<ref name=dramaquarterly_180629 /> Pina argued that it was this ability to change view

Consisting of twenty bands in total, all but one were created by the [[Noldor]]in [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-smiths of Eregion, led by their ruler Celebrimbor under the deception of Sauron, who came in disguise as a fair-looking emissary named Annatar.\n\nWhen worn, each Ring can give its [[Ring-bearer|bearer]] a power to govern their respective [[Middle-earth peoples|race]]\u2014[[Three Rings]] were given to the remaining Elf leaders in Middle-earth, [[Seven Rings]] were sent to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-lords]], and [[Nine Rings]] to several leaders of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]].

Sauron waged an assault upon the Elves who hid them upon discovering his true motive. He successfully captured all but the Three, which remained hidden from him. Though the Seven only fueled the greed of the Dwarves, the Nine corrupted the men, whose desire for power made them fall under his dominance and eventually become the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], his chief servants. Numerous characters in the novel had taken possession of the Rings, most especially the One Ring, which was ultimately found by the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], who later bequeathed it to his heir [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], who then took on a quest to destroy it.\n\nThough the One Ring had originally appeared in Tolkien's [[Juvenile fantasy|children's fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1937, all the twenty Rings of Power were fully documented in ''The Lord of the Rings'', which primarily focuses on the assembly of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] from all of races of Middle-earth tasked to aid Frodo in destroying it whilst evading Sauron's attempts to recover it. According to Tolkien, the purpose of the Rings was to give their respective wearers \"wealth and dominion over others\", though Three Rings were made to \"heal and preserve\" the Elvendom in Middle-earth. Its primary power was \"the prevention and slowing of ''decay'' of time\" by granting its wearer an unnatural long life and rendering things invisible or visible. This power appealed the most to the Elves, whose gift of immortality had left them to desire for a physical world of Middle-earth to remain unchanged and delay the inevitable [[Dominion of Men]]. Tolkien's subsequent posthumous works such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', also offer a more detailed account on the history of the Rings of Power.\n\n== Fictional history ==\n{{see also|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = <poem>\n''Three Rings for the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-kings under the sky,''\n  ''Seven for the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-lords in their halls of stone,''\n''Nine for Mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] doomed to die,''\n  ''One for the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]] on his dark throne,''\n''In the Land of [[Mordor]] where the Shadows lie,''\n  ''One Ring to rule them all, one Ring to find them,''\n  ''One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them''\n''In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie''</poem>\n |author = \u2014 [[J.R.R.

Although \"unsullied\" by Sauron's hand, they were made by his craft and were bound to the One.

C\u00edrdan entrusted it to [[Gandalf]] at the Grey Havens to aid in his labours.<ref name=\"Three Rings 1\" group=T/>\n* Nenya (the Ring of Water, the White Ring, the Ring of Adamant) was the chief of the Three. It was made of [[mithril]] and set with a \"shimmering white stone\". Celebrimbor gave it to Galadriel, who used it to protect and preserve the realm of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n* Vilya (the Ring of Air, the Blue Ring) was the mightiest of the Three. It was made of gold and set with a Sapphire. Celebrimbor gave the ring to Gil-galad, and Gil-galad gave it in turn to Elrond, who used the ring in [[Rivendell]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\nWhen Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger, the Elves became aware of him and realized that he could use the One to control the Three. They immediately took off the rings to forestall him. Sauron demanded that the Three be given to him,<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> but Galadriel counseled Celebrimbor to keep the Three Rings hidden.<ref name=\"Three Rings 1\" group=T/> Sauron fought the Elves to obtain them, and captured and tortured Celebrimbor, who died without revealing the rings' location.<ref name=\"Unfinished Tales 1\" group=T/> Sauron could not discover where they were hidden, and only after his defeat at the end of the Second Age, when the One Ring was cut from his finger, did the Elves begin to use them.

When Eregion was sacked, Sauron took them from a tortured Celebrimbor and later gave them several leaders of men\u2014three of which were from N\u00famen\u00f3r and one was an [[Easterling]]. The nine men who used their rings became \"mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old.\" Giving them glory and great wealth, the rings also gave them an unending long life, yet it became unendurable to them. In addition, the rings gave to an ability to see things in worlds invisible to mortal men, but these are often the phantoms and delusions made by Sauron.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> One by one, they fell to the power of the One Ring and after 550 years, all nine of them have been turned into ring-wraiths \u2014 also known as the [[Nazg\u00fbl]].<ref group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix B}}</ref> Bound to Sauron's will, they became invisible save to him, and became his chief servants.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\n=== The One ===\n{{main|The One Ring}}\n\n[[File:Unico Anello.png|thumb|upright|The [[One Ring]] was made by [[Sauron]] to rule all the others.]]\n\nThe One Ring was forged in the fires [[Mount Doom]] in secret by Sauron himself to rule over the wearers of the other Rings, and only there it can be unmade.

While Sauron wore the One, he can perceive all that were done by means using the lesser Rings, and he could see and govern the very thoughts of those who wore them, and used it to gain mastery for almost all of Eriador, except for Lindon. Following Sauron's defeat to Elendil and Gil-galad at the War of the Last Alliance, the Ring was cut from his hand by Isildur, who took it as a [[weregild]] for his own and refused Elrond and C\u00edrdan's counsel to destroy it.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\nIsildur bore the Ring as an heirloom of his house, but his host was ambushed by orcs on the river [[Anduin]].

Primarily featured in his [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[high fantasy]] novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954), these magic rings are depicted as the titular objects essential in the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]]'s conquest to rule over [[Middle-earth]] as the namesake \"Lord of the Rings\". Consisting of twenty bands in total, all but one were created by the [[Noldor]]in [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-smiths of Eregion, led by their ruler Celebrimbor under the deception of Sauron, who came in disguise as a fair-looking emissary named Annatar.\n\nWhen worn, each Ring can give its [[Ring-bearer|bearer]] a power to govern their respective [[Middle-earth peoples|race]]\u2014[[Three Rings]] were given to the remaining Elf leaders in Middle-earth, [[Seven Rings]] were sent to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-lords]], and [[Nine Rings]] to several leaders of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. All Rings of Power are bound to a master ring, [[One Ring|the One]], which the Dark Lord had forged alone in secret at [[Mount Doom]] to control all the other wearers, effectively ruling a dominion over Middle-earth. Sauron waged an assault upon the Elves who hid them upon discovering his true motive. He successfully captured all but the Three, which remained hidden from him. Though the Seven only fueled the greed of the Dwarves, the Nine corrupted the men, whose desire for power made them fall under his dominance and eventually become the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], his chief servants. Numerous characters in the novel had taken possession of the Rings, most especially the One Ring, which was ultimately found by the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], who later bequeathed it to his heir [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], who then took on a quest to destroy it.\n\nThough the One Ring had originally appeared in Tolkien's [[Juvenile fantasy|children's fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1937, all the twenty Rings of Power were fully documented in ''The Lord of the Rings'', which primarily focuses on the assembly of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] from all of races of Middle-earth tasked to aid Frodo in destroying it whilst evading Sauron's attempts to recover it. According to Tolkien, the purpose of the Rings was to give their respective wearers \"wealth and dominion over others\", though Three Rings were made to \"heal and preserve\" the Elvendom in Middle-earth. Its primary power was \"the prevention and slowing of ''decay'' of time\" by granting its wearer an unnatural long life and rendering things invisible or visible. This power appealed the most to the Elves, whose gift of immortality had left them to desire for a physical world of Middle-earth to remain unchanged and delay the inevitable [[Dominion of Men]]. Tolkien's subsequent posthumous works such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', also offer a more detailed account on the history of the Rings of Power.\n\n== Fictional history ==\n{{see also|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = <poem>\n''Three Rings for the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-kings under the sky,''\n  ''Seven for the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-lords in their halls of stone,''\n''Nine for Mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] doomed to die,''\n  ''One for the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]] on his dark throne,''\n''In the Land of [[Mordor]] where the Shadows lie,''\n  ''One Ring to rule them all, one Ring to find them,''\n  ''One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them''\n''In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie''</poem>\n |author = \u2014 [[J.R.R.
