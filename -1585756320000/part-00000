''Kiss of Death'' was planned as a three-issue limited series<ref name=TCJ116 /> but only published two issues. (It was completed in ''Last Kiss'', co-published with [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1988.)\n\nThat year the company also published its first translation: ''[[Kogaratsu]]'',<ref>Dutry, Jacques. \"International Newswatch: The French Comics Scene Part Two,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #120 (Mar. 1988), p. 20.</ref> a popular [[Franco-Belgian comic|Franco-Belgian]] [[samurai]] title by Bosse (Serge Bosmans) and Michetz (Marc Degroide).\n\nAnother title published by Acme was 1989's ''Lea: The Confessions of Julius Antoine'' by [[Serge Le Tendre]] and Christian Rossi, an English translation of a French comics album; the book was distributed in the U.S. by [[Fantagraphics Books]]. ''Lea'' won the 1990 [[UK Comic Art Award]] for Best Translated Graphic Novel.<ref>MCH. \"Newswatch: Arkham Leads British Awards,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #137 (Sept. 1990), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe Acme founders split editorial duties on the various titles, French translations were by Hansom, and many books were lettered by Bambos. \n\nAt some point during this period the company produced and sold a few select comics-related videotapes, including ''Alan Moore at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|I.C.A.]]'', ''10 Years of [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', and ''[[Will Eisner]]: A Life of Sequential Art''.<ref name=WhosWhoAcme />\n\n=== Retail location ===\nAcme opened a retail location, '''Acme Comics''', in 1987 on [[Coldharbour Lane]] in [[Brixton]],<ref name=TCJ131>Brooks, Brad! \"International Spotlight: Frank Bellamy: ''Dan Dare'' Artist Exhibited at South London Gallery,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #131 (Sept. 1989), pp. 13\u201314.</ref><ref name=Curson072910 /> [[South London]].

Highlights from that era included ''[[Powerman (comics)|Power Comics]]'', a four-issue superhero title by writers Don Avenall and [[Norman Worker]], with art by [[Dave Gibbons]] and [[Brian Bolland]]. The title was originally published in [[Nigeria]] in 1975, and the title's character's names was changed from \"Powerman\" to \"Powerbolt\" to avoid confusion with the character [[Luke Cage]] (also called \"Power Man\"), published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Another notable title from the Acme/Eclipse era was ''Aces'', a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized [[Jazz Age]] genre stories which were originally published in Europe. Among its features were \"Hollywood Eye,\" by Francois Rivi\u00e8re, [[Jean-Louis Bouquet]], and Philippe Berthet; \"Air Mail\" by Attilio Micheluzi; and \"Morgan\" by [[Antonio Segura]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortiz (comics)|Jos\u00e9 Ortiz]].\n\nIn 1989 Acme struck up a relationship with [[John Brown Publishing]], co-publishing with JBP the two-issue anthology ''Point Blank'', which promoted itself as \"The Best of European Strip Art\". Creators included Ruben Pellejero & [[Jorge Zentner]], and [[Giancarlo Berardi]] & [[Ivo Milazzo]]. This title was also distributed in the U.S. via Eclipse. Acme also sold ''Speakeasy'' to JPB in 1989.<ref>\"Newswatch: ''Speakeasy'' Goes Out with a ''Blast!'',\" ''The Comics Journal'' #140 (Feb. 1991), p. 21.</ref><ref>Curson, Natasha.

The series featured the three-part story, \"The Golden Game,\" in issues #1\u20133, by [[Grant Morrison]]; and a two-part story, \"A Deadly Rainbow,\" in issues #2\u20133, by Anne Caulfield; both had art by [[Ian Gibson (comics)|Ian Gibson]].\n\nIn 1990 Acme teamed with Eclipse to release [[Eddie Campbell]]'s ''The Complete Alec'',<ref>Yang, Sam. \"A Loaf of Bread, A Jug of Wine and Eddie Campbell,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #145 (Oct. 1991), p. 59.</ref> which collected three previous \"Alec\" publications \u2014 ''Alec'' (1984), ''Love and Beerglasses'' (1985), and ''Doggie in the Window'' (1986) \u2014 together with some unpublished material.

Written by Gary Pleece and illustrated by [[Warren Pleece]], it was the \"first U.S. issue\" of what had previously been the brother's self-publishing venture from 1987 to 1989. A satirical collection of stories, there were no recurring characters, but many recognizable caricatures from politics and pop culture.\n\nAcme reorganized in 1991, changing its name from Acme Press to '''Acme Comics'''.\n\n=== Dark Horse/Acme ===\nAcme's relationship with Eclipse ended in 1992 (Eclipse would go defunct a year later), and Acme struck up a new arrangement with another up-and-coming American black-and-white publisher, [[Dark Horse Comics]]. With Dark Horse, Acme acted more as a [[Book packager|packager]] rather than a co-publisher. (The Acme logo was styled to look like a Dark Horse imprint.) The comics the two companies produced were strictly James Bond titles (edited by Hansom) and the nine-issue series ''Lux & Alby Sign on and Save the Universe'', by [[Martin Millar]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]. (Another James Bond story, \"Operation Miasma\" by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Russ Heath]], appeared in the ''Dark Horse Comics'' anthology, issue #25, published Sept. 1994.) Co-founder Dick Hansom, though not technically working for Acme at the time, edited [[Bryan Talbot]]'s ''[[The Tale of One Bad Rat]]'', published by Dark Horse in 1994\u20131995.<ref name=WhosWhoHansom />\n\nAcme's partnership with Dark Horse lasted until 1995.\n\n=== Closure and further careers of the founders ===\nAcme went defunct in 1995. Co-founders Ashford, Ridout, and Bambos all found work in the mainstream comics industry for a time.\n\nBambos left Acme in 1988, moving on to [[Dave Elliott (comics)|Dave Elliott]] and [[Garry Leach]]'s [[Atomeka Press]], where he worked until 1990. In the early 1990s, he found some work as a cover inker for [[Marvel Comics]].<ref name=WhosWhoBambos>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=GEORGIOU%2C+BAMBOS Bambos entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He worked freelance as an assistant editor at Marvel from 1991 to 1994, while performing the same duties at DC Comics.<ref name=WhosWhoAshford>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=ASHFORD%2C+DICK Ashford entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He wrote a two-part [[Scarlet Witch]] story in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' in 1993, and worked as an editor for [[Marvel UK]] (on the ''[[Doctor Who (comics)|Doctor Who: Classic Comics]]'' series) in 1994. He wrote the ''[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]'' graphic novel  (which was edited by Ashford), published by Marvel in 1995.<ref>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=RIDOUT%2C+CEFN Ridout entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

The fourth volume of ''Maxwell the Magic Cat'' contained a gallery of Maxwell illustrations by the likes of [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]], [[Gilbert Shelton]], [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]], [[Graham Higgins]], [[Phil Elliott]], [[Rian Hughes]], and [[Brian Bolland]].\n\nIn March 1987 Acme debuted ''Kiss of Death'',<ref name=TCJ116>\"Newswatch World: British Black-and-Whites After Market Collapse,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #116 (July 1987), p. 131.</ref> a [[horror comics]] anthology featuring the artwork of [[John Watkiss]]. ''Kiss of Death'' was planned as a three-issue limited series<ref name=TCJ116 /> but only published two issues. (It was completed in ''Last Kiss'', co-published with [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1988.)\n\nThat year the company also published its first translation: ''[[Kogaratsu]]'',<ref>Dutry, Jacques. \"International Newswatch: The French Comics Scene Part Two,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #120 (Mar. 1988), p. 20.</ref> a popular [[Franco-Belgian comic|Franco-Belgian]] [[samurai]] title by Bosse (Serge Bosmans) and Michetz (Marc Degroide).\n\nAnother title published by Acme was 1989's ''Lea: The Confessions of Julius Antoine'' by [[Serge Le Tendre]] and Christian Rossi, an English translation of a French comics album; the book was distributed in the U.S. by [[Fantagraphics Books]]. ''Lea'' won the 1990 [[UK Comic Art Award]] for Best Translated Graphic Novel.<ref>MCH. \"Newswatch: Arkham Leads British Awards,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #137 (Sept. 1990), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe Acme founders split editorial duties on the various titles, French translations were by Hansom, and many books were lettered by Bambos. \n\nAt some point during this period the company produced and sold a few select comics-related videotapes, including ''Alan Moore at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|I.C.A.]]'', ''10 Years of [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', and ''[[Will Eisner]]: A Life of Sequential Art''.<ref name=WhosWhoAcme />\n\n=== Retail location ===\nAcme opened a retail location, '''Acme Comics''', in 1987 on [[Coldharbour Lane]] in [[Brixton]],<ref name=TCJ131>Brooks, Brad! \"International Spotlight: Frank Bellamy: ''Dan Dare'' Artist Exhibited at South London Gallery,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #131 (Sept. 1989), pp. 13\u201314.</ref><ref name=Curson072910 /> [[South London]].

Highlights from that era included ''[[Powerman (comics)|Power Comics]]'', a four-issue superhero title by writers Don Avenall and [[Norman Worker]], with art by [[Dave Gibbons]] and [[Brian Bolland]]. The title was originally published in [[Nigeria]] in 1975, and the title's character's names was changed from \"Powerman\" to \"Powerbolt\" to avoid confusion with the character [[Luke Cage]] (also called \"Power Man\"), published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Another notable title from the Acme/Eclipse era was ''Aces'', a five-issue black-and-white anthology of serialized [[Jazz Age]] genre stories which were originally published in Europe. Among its features were \"Hollywood Eye,\" by Francois Rivi\u00e8re, [[Jean-Louis Bouquet]], and Philippe Berthet; \"Air Mail\" by Attilio Micheluzi; and \"Morgan\" by [[Antonio Segura]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortiz (comics)|Jos\u00e9 Ortiz]].\n\nIn 1989 Acme struck up a relationship with [[John Brown Publishing]], co-publishing with JBP the two-issue anthology ''Point Blank'', which promoted itself as \"The Best of European Strip Art\". Creators included Ruben Pellejero & [[Jorge Zentner]], and [[Giancarlo Berardi]] & [[Ivo Milazzo]]. This title was also distributed in the U.S. via Eclipse. Acme also sold ''Speakeasy'' to JPB in 1989.<ref>\"Newswatch: ''Speakeasy'' Goes Out with a ''Blast!'',\" ''The Comics Journal'' #140 (Feb. 1991), p. 21.</ref><ref>Curson, Natasha.

The series featured the three-part story, \"The Golden Game,\" in issues #1\u20133, by [[Grant Morrison]]; and a two-part story, \"A Deadly Rainbow,\" in issues #2\u20133, by Anne Caulfield; both had art by [[Ian Gibson (comics)|Ian Gibson]].\n\nIn 1990 Acme teamed with Eclipse to release [[Eddie Campbell]]'s ''The Complete Alec'',<ref>Yang, Sam. \"A Loaf of Bread, A Jug of Wine and Eddie Campbell,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #145 (Oct. 1991), p. 59.</ref> which collected three previous \"Alec\" publications \u2014 ''Alec'' (1984), ''Love and Beerglasses'' (1985), and ''Doggie in the Window'' (1986) \u2014 together with some unpublished material. The collection won the 1991 [[UK Comic Art Award]] for Best Graphic Novel Collection.<ref name=TCJ142>\"British Awards Announced,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #142 (June 1991), p. 17.</ref> \n\nAcme/Eclipse published ''Velocity'' #4 in 1991. Written by Gary Pleece and illustrated by [[Warren Pleece]], it was the \"first U.S. issue\" of what had previously been the brother's self-publishing venture from 1987 to 1989. A satirical collection of stories, there were no recurring characters, but many recognizable caricatures from politics and pop culture.\n\nAcme reorganized in 1991, changing its name from Acme Press to '''Acme Comics'''.\n\n=== Dark Horse/Acme ===\nAcme's relationship with Eclipse ended in 1992 (Eclipse would go defunct a year later), and Acme struck up a new arrangement with another up-and-coming American black-and-white publisher, [[Dark Horse Comics]]. With Dark Horse, Acme acted more as a [[Book packager|packager]] rather than a co-publisher. (The Acme logo was styled to look like a Dark Horse imprint.) The comics the two companies produced were strictly James Bond titles (edited by Hansom) and the nine-issue series ''Lux & Alby Sign on and Save the Universe'', by [[Martin Millar]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]. (Another James Bond story, \"Operation Miasma\" by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Russ Heath]], appeared in the ''Dark Horse Comics'' anthology, issue #25, published Sept. 1994.) Co-founder Dick Hansom, though not technically working for Acme at the time, edited [[Bryan Talbot]]'s ''[[The Tale of One Bad Rat]]'', published by Dark Horse in 1994\u20131995.<ref name=WhosWhoHansom />\n\nAcme's partnership with Dark Horse lasted until 1995.\n\n=== Closure and further careers of the founders ===\nAcme went defunct in 1995. Co-founders Ashford, Ridout, and Bambos all found work in the mainstream comics industry for a time.\n\nBambos left Acme in 1988, moving on to [[Dave Elliott (comics)|Dave Elliott]] and [[Garry Leach]]'s [[Atomeka Press]], where he worked until 1990. In the early 1990s, he found some work as a cover inker for [[Marvel Comics]].<ref name=WhosWhoBambos>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=GEORGIOU%2C+BAMBOS Bambos entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''. Retrieved Jan. 8, 2020.</ref>\n\nAshford appears to have left Acme around 1989. He had latched on with Marvel in 1988, first as an editorial assistant with the company until 1991. He worked freelance as an assistant editor at Marvel from 1991 to 1994, while performing the same duties at DC Comics.<ref name=WhosWhoAshford>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=ASHFORD%2C+DICK Ashford entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He wrote a two-part [[Scarlet Witch]] story in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' in 1993, and worked as an editor for [[Marvel UK]] (on the ''[[Doctor Who (comics)|Doctor Who: Classic Comics]]'' series) in 1994. He wrote the ''[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]'' graphic novel  (which was edited by Ashford), published by Marvel in 1995.<ref>[http://bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=RIDOUT%2C+CEFN Ridout entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928\u20131999''.

He also competed in the [[Cycling at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 25 kilometres|men's 25 kilometres event]] at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] and won a bronze medal in the [[Cycling at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's points race|Men's points race]] .<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/tr/louis-trousselier-1.html |title=Louis Trousselier Olympic Results |accessdate=2013-05-02 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nTrousselier was born on 29 June 1881 in [[Paris]]. Nicknamed Trou-Trou, he came from a rich family which had a flower business in central Paris. For that reason, when [[Henri Desgrange]], the first organiser of the Tour, sought to popularise competitors by giving them nicknames, he referred to Trousselier as \"the florist\".\n\nTrousselier's brothers L\u00e9opold and [[Andr\u00e9 Trousselier|Andr\u00e9]] were also cyclists.\n\nAfter competing in the 1900 Summer Olympics,<ref name=\"sports-reference\"/> Trousselier turned professional and rode his first professional race during Christmas 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010164838:mpeg21:a0005|publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek|work=Algemeen Dagblad|date=22 December 1900|accessdate=3 January 2017|language=Dutch|page=1|title=Sport en Wedstrijden:wielernieuws}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis Trousselier 1903.jpg|thumb|left|Trousselier in 1903 at [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]].

He dominated the race winning five stages, completing the 3,021&nbsp;km in 110 hours 26 minutes and 58 second at an average speed of 27.48&nbsp;km. He won with 35 points ahead of [[Hippolyte Aucouturier]] (61 pts) and [[Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq]] (64pts). Victory brought him all his prizes, contracts to ride all over France and a bonus from his sponsor. But that night, in a trackside cabin in Paris, he lost the whole lot playing dice with friends.\n\n\"There's always another Tour to win it back again\", he is reputed to have said, although he never rode as well again. The one bet that he did win was that the army would forgive him for overstaying his leave.\n\nHe rode the Tour well again in 1906 but never to the level of the previous year, nevertheless winning stages and finishing third. He became a specialist in long-distance racing, in 1908 winning [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]] 26 minutes ahead of the next rider, [[Cyrille van Hauwaert]]. He twice came second in the race and once third. He came second in the 1906 [[Bol d'Or cycle race|Bol d'Or 24-hour race]]  at the [[V\u00e9lodrome Buffalo]] in [[Paris]]. He rode a [[Six-day racing|six-day event]] on the track, although he decided against specialising in what could have been a profitable career.\n\nHe stopped racing just before [[World War I]] and took over the family business.\n\nTrousselier had an entertaining personality and a taste for practical jokes. He was known for training with friends and stopping with them at the most expensive restaurant they could find. Towards the end of the meal, they would start a mock argument in which their raised voices attracted the attention of the restaurateur.

He came third in the [[1906 Tour de France]] and won 13 stages of the [[Tour de France]] over his career. He also competed in the [[Cycling at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 25 kilometres|men's 25 kilometres event]] at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] and won a bronze medal in the [[Cycling at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's points race|Men's points race]] .<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/tr/louis-trousselier-1.html |title=Louis Trousselier Olympic Results |accessdate=2013-05-02 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nTrousselier was born on 29 June 1881 in [[Paris]]. Nicknamed Trou-Trou, he came from a rich family which had a flower business in central Paris. For that reason, when [[Henri Desgrange]], the first organiser of the Tour, sought to popularise competitors by giving them nicknames, he referred to Trousselier as \"the florist\".\n\nTrousselier's brothers L\u00e9opold and [[Andr\u00e9 Trousselier|Andr\u00e9]] were also cyclists.\n\nAfter competing in the 1900 Summer Olympics,<ref name=\"sports-reference\"/> Trousselier turned professional and rode his first professional race during Christmas 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010164838:mpeg21:a0005|publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek|work=Algemeen Dagblad|date=22 December 1900|accessdate=3 January 2017|language=Dutch|page=1|title=Sport en Wedstrijden:wielernieuws}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Louis Trousselier 1903.jpg|thumb|left|Trousselier in 1903 at [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]].

He dominated the race winning five stages, completing the 3,021&nbsp;km in 110 hours 26 minutes and 58 second at an average speed of 27.48&nbsp;km. He won with 35 points ahead of [[Hippolyte Aucouturier]] (61 pts) and [[Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq]] (64pts). Victory brought him all his prizes, contracts to ride all over France and a bonus from his sponsor. But that night, in a trackside cabin in Paris, he lost the whole lot playing dice with friends.\n\n\"There's always another Tour to win it back again\", he is reputed to have said, although he never rode as well again. The one bet that he did win was that the army would forgive him for overstaying his leave.\n\nHe rode the Tour well again in 1906 but never to the level of the previous year, nevertheless winning stages and finishing third. He became a specialist in long-distance racing, in 1908 winning [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]] 26 minutes ahead of the next rider, [[Cyrille van Hauwaert]]. He twice came second in the race and once third. He came second in the 1906 [[Bol d'Or cycle race|Bol d'Or 24-hour race]]  at the [[V\u00e9lodrome Buffalo]] in [[Paris]]. He rode a [[Six-day racing|six-day event]] on the track, although he decided against specialising in what could have been a profitable career.\n\nHe stopped racing just before [[World War I]] and took over the family business.\n\nTrousselier had an entertaining personality and a taste for practical jokes. He was known for training with friends and stopping with them at the most expensive restaurant they could find. Towards the end of the meal, they would start a mock argument in which their raised voices attracted the attention of the restaurateur. When he went to intervene, he was told the argument was over who among them was the best rider. The only way to settle it was a race and the restaurateur was invited to set a local landmark several kilometres distant to which the riders would race and then turn and race back to the restaurant. Whoever came in last would pay the bill.\n\nThe restaurateur would then set his diners off on their race... only for them never to return.\n\n==Career achievements==\n\n===Major results===\n{{div col}}\n;1905\n:[[1905 Tour de France|Tour de France]] &ndash; [[File:Jersey yellow.svg|20px]]'''1st overall''' and 5 stage wins\n:[[1905 Paris\u2013Roubaix|Paris\u2013Roubaix]]\n:[[Paris\u2013Valenciennes]]\n:[[Brussels\u2013Roubaix]]\n;[[1906 Tour de France]]\n:3rd overall and 4 stage wins\n;[[1907 Tour de France]]\n:2 stages (one tied with [[Emile Georget]])\n;1908\n:[[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]]\n;[[1909 Tour de France]]\n:1 stage win\n;[[1910 Tour de France]]\n:1 stage win\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Grand Tour general classification results timeline ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!align=\"left\"|Grand Tour\n! scope=\"col\" | 1905\n! scope=\"col\" | 1906\n! scope=\"col\" | 1907\n! scope=\"col\" | 1908\n! scope=\"col\" | 1909\n! scope=\"col\" | 1910\n! scope=\"col\" | 1911\n! scope=\"col\" | 1912\n! scope=\"col\" | 1913\n! scope=\"col\" | 1914\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Giro d'Italia]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" | DNF-5\n|align=\"center\" | DNE\n|align=\"center\" | DNE\n|align=\"center\" | DNE\n|align=\"center\" | DNE\n|align=\"center\" | DNE\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Tour de France]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#00ff00;\"| 1 \n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#D8BFD8;\"| 3\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\"| DNF-10\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\"| DNF-2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#EEE8AA;\"| 8\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\"| DNF-14\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#AAAAAA;\"| DNF-3\n|align=\"center\" | DNE\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#DDDDDD;\"| 11\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#DDDDDD;\"| 38\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A \n|align=\"center\" style=\"color:#888888;\"| N/A\n|}\n{{grandtourlegend}}\n\n==Death==\nHe died on April 24, 1939 in [[Paris]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316035239/http://www.france-cyclisme.com/trousselier.htm France-cyclisme.com profile {{in lang|fr}}]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050307132745/http://fr.sports.yahoo.com/cy/profiles/2167.html Yahoo!

Mathewson served in the [[United States Army]]'s [[Chemical Corps|Chemical Warfare Service]] in World War I, and was accidentally exposed to [[chemical weapon]]s during training.

His career [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 2.13 and 79 career [[shutout#Baseball|shutouts]] are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 [[win (baseball)|wins]] are still number one in the National League, tied with [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the \"fadeaway\" (later known in baseball as the \"[[screwball]]\"), which he learned from teammate [[Dave Williams (1900s pitcher)|Dave Williams]] in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers|author=Bill James|author2=Rob Neyer|author-link=Bill James|author2-link=Rob Neyer|last-author-amp=yes|year=2004|page=296|title-link=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers}}</ref>\n\nThis reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his \"fadeaway\" from [[Rube Foster|Andrew \"Rube\" Foster]] when New York Giants manager [[John McGraw|John Joseph McGraw]] quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal.\n\nMathewson recorded 2,507 career [[strikeout]]s against only 848 [[base on balls|walks]]. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]], who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson's 11, with one no-decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|title=''The Ballplayers: Christy Mathewson''|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|date=September 4, 1916|access-date=2009-04-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414040144/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|archive-date=April 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (362-for-1687) with\n151 [[run (baseball)|runs]], seven [[home runs]], and 167 [[RBI]]. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he was in double figures in RBIs, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low ERAs and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped McGraw raise the Giants' place in the standings. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world.\n\nMathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, [[Roger Bresnahan]] had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson's pitches to Bresnahan's glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson allowed only 1.28 earned runs for every nine innings. His 206 strikeouts led the league, earning him the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]].<ref name=\"RRBio\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ray|title=Matty : an American hero|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509263-9}}</ref>\n\nMathewson's Giants won the [[1905 World Series]] over the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1\u20131, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits.\n\nIn the next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of [[diphtheria]]. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22-12 record, his 2.97 ERA was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 WHIP, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks.\n\n[[File:Christy Mathewson 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Mathewson with the New York Giants, around 1913]]\nBy 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league's elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 ERA and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second Triple Crown. He also led the league in innings pitched and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 WHIP. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as [[Merkle's Boner]], an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game.\n\nMathewson returned for an incredible 1909 season, posting better numbers than the previous year. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the [[1911 World Series]] to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and [[Rube Marquard]] allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer [[Home Run Baker|Frank Baker]], earning him the nickname, \"Home Run\".<ref name=\"RRBio\" /> Mathewson, the team's \"star pitcher\", signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length. <ref> {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Matty Signs up for Three Years |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn85054113/1910-11-15/ed-1/seq-7/ |work=The Ogdensburg Journal |location=Ogdensburg, NY |date=November 15, 1910 |access-date=October 16, 2019 }} </ref>\n\nIn 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the \"11,000-dollar lemon\" who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the [[1912 World Series]], the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who were to face the Giants in the World Series that year had it not been cancelled. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an ERA below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in game seven, cost them the championship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaccaro|first=Mike|title=First Fall Classic|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfallclassic00mike|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}</ref>  The Giants also lost the [[1913 World Series]], a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson's final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 ERA in over 300 innings pitched complemented by  0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched.\n\nFor the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson's penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916.<ref name=\"RRBio\" />\n\n===Three years with the Reds===\n[[File:1904 Christy Mathewson-restore.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in 1904]]\nOn July 20, {{mlby|1916}}, Mathewson's career came full circle when he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with [[Edd Roush]].  He was immediately named as the Reds' [[player-manager]].  However, he appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson's Reds over Brown's Cubs, 10-8.<ref name=\"Okrent\">{{cite book|last1=Okrent|first1=Daniel|title=The Ultimate Baseball Book|date=1988|publisher=Hilltown Press|location=United States|isbn=0395361451|pages=80}}</ref>\n\nMathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164-176 as a manager.<ref name=\"Okrent\" />\n\n==Personal life and literary career==\n[[File:Christy and Jane Mathewson photograph, circa 1916.png|thumb|left|Mathewson and his wife Jane, circa 1916.]]\nMathewson married wife Jane in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after.  Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas in 1950. During Mathewson's playing years, the family lived in a duplex in upper Manhattan alongside Mathewson's manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson's younger brother Nicholas Mathewson committed suicide in a neighbor's barn. Another brother, [[Henry Mathewson]], pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917.\n\nMathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. As noted in ''[[The National League Story]]'' (1961) by [[Lee Allen (baseball)|Lee Allen]], Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans. However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the [[Chicago Cubs]] ([[Illinois]]), [[Cincinnati Reds]] ([[Ohio]]), and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] ([[Missouri]]) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday.\n\nIn his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field.  Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants. He was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom.\n\nMathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, Mathewson published his classic memoir ''Pitching in a Pinch,'' or Pitching from the Inside,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pitching in a Pinch, or Baseball from the Inside|last=Mathewson|first=Christy|publisher=G.B.

He played in the minor leagues in 1899, recording a record of 21 wins and two losses. He pitched for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] the next season, but was sent back to the minors. He eventually returned to the Giants, and went on to win 373 games in his career, a [[National League]] record. He led the Giants to victory in the [[1905 World Series]] by pitching three [[shutout#Baseball|shutouts]]. Mathewson never pitched on [[Sunday baseball games|Sundays]], owing to his Christian beliefs. Mathewson served in the [[United States Army]]'s [[Chemical Corps|Chemical Warfare Service]] in World War I, and was accidentally exposed to [[chemical weapon]]s during training. His respiratory system was weakened from the exposure, causing him to contract [[tuberculosis]], from which he died in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] in 1925.\n\n==Early life==\nMathewson was born in [[Factoryville, Pennsylvania]] and attended high school at [[Keystone College|Keystone Academy]].

Some historians speculate that the Giants got word that their star pitcher was risking his baseball career for the Stars and ordered him to stop, while others feel that the Stars' coach, [[Willis Richardson (American football)|Willis Richardson]], got rid of Mathewson because he felt that, since the fullback's [[Punt (gridiron football)|punting skills]] were hardly used, he could replace him with a local player, Shirley Ellis.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Dave Berry and the Philadelphia Story |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=2 |issue=Annual |year=1980 |pages=1\u20139 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-053.pdf |first=Bob |last=Carroll |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127040523/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-053.pdf |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Career with the Giants===\n[[File:Mathewson in NY uniform.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in his New York Giants uniform]]\nDuring his 17-year career, Mathewson won 373 games and lost 188 for a .665 winning percentage. His career [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 2.13 and 79 career [[shutout#Baseball|shutouts]] are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 [[win (baseball)|wins]] are still number one in the National League, tied with [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the \"fadeaway\" (later known in baseball as the \"[[screwball]]\"), which he learned from teammate [[Dave Williams (1900s pitcher)|Dave Williams]] in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers|author=Bill James|author2=Rob Neyer|author-link=Bill James|author2-link=Rob Neyer|last-author-amp=yes|year=2004|page=296|title-link=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers}}</ref>\n\nThis reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his \"fadeaway\" from [[Rube Foster|Andrew \"Rube\" Foster]] when New York Giants manager [[John McGraw|John Joseph McGraw]] quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal.\n\nMathewson recorded 2,507 career [[strikeout]]s against only 848 [[base on balls|walks]]. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]], who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson's 11, with one no-decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|title=''The Ballplayers: Christy Mathewson''|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|date=September 4, 1916|access-date=2009-04-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414040144/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|archive-date=April 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (362-for-1687) with\n151 [[run (baseball)|runs]], seven [[home runs]], and 167 [[RBI]]. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he was in double figures in RBIs, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low ERAs and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped McGraw raise the Giants' place in the standings. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world.\n\nMathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, [[Roger Bresnahan]] had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson's pitches to Bresnahan's glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson allowed only 1.28 earned runs for every nine innings. His 206 strikeouts led the league, earning him the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]].<ref name=\"RRBio\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ray|title=Matty : an American hero|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509263-9}}</ref>\n\nMathewson's Giants won the [[1905 World Series]] over the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1\u20131, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits.\n\nIn the next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of [[diphtheria]]. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22-12 record, his 2.97 ERA was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 WHIP, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks.\n\n[[File:Christy Mathewson 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Mathewson with the New York Giants, around 1913]]\nBy 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league's elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 ERA and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second Triple Crown. He also led the league in innings pitched and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 WHIP. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as [[Merkle's Boner]], an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game.\n\nMathewson returned for an incredible 1909 season, posting better numbers than the previous year. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the [[1911 World Series]] to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and [[Rube Marquard]] allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer [[Home Run Baker|Frank Baker]], earning him the nickname, \"Home Run\".<ref name=\"RRBio\" /> Mathewson, the team's \"star pitcher\", signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length. <ref> {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Matty Signs up for Three Years |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn85054113/1910-11-15/ed-1/seq-7/ |work=The Ogdensburg Journal |location=Ogdensburg, NY |date=November 15, 1910 |access-date=October 16, 2019 }} </ref>\n\nIn 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the \"11,000-dollar lemon\" who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the [[1912 World Series]], the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who were to face the Giants in the World Series that year had it not been cancelled. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an ERA below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in game seven, cost them the championship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaccaro|first=Mike|title=First Fall Classic|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfallclassic00mike|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}</ref>  The Giants also lost the [[1913 World Series]], a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson's final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 ERA in over 300 innings pitched complemented by  0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched.\n\nFor the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson's penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916.<ref name=\"RRBio\" />\n\n===Three years with the Reds===\n[[File:1904 Christy Mathewson-restore.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in 1904]]\nOn July 20, {{mlby|1916}}, Mathewson's career came full circle when he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with [[Edd Roush]].  He was immediately named as the Reds' [[player-manager]].  However, he appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson's Reds over Brown's Cubs, 10-8.<ref name=\"Okrent\">{{cite book|last1=Okrent|first1=Daniel|title=The Ultimate Baseball Book|date=1988|publisher=Hilltown Press|location=United States|isbn=0395361451|pages=80}}</ref>\n\nMathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164-176 as a manager.<ref name=\"Okrent\" />\n\n==Personal life and literary career==\n[[File:Christy and Jane Mathewson photograph, circa 1916.png|thumb|left|Mathewson and his wife Jane, circa 1916.]]\nMathewson married wife Jane in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after.  Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas in 1950. During Mathewson's playing years, the family lived in a duplex in upper Manhattan alongside Mathewson's manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson's younger brother Nicholas Mathewson committed suicide in a neighbor's barn. Another brother, [[Henry Mathewson]], pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917.\n\nMathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. As noted in ''[[The National League Story]]'' (1961) by [[Lee Allen (baseball)|Lee Allen]], Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans. However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the [[Chicago Cubs]] ([[Illinois]]), [[Cincinnati Reds]] ([[Ohio]]), and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] ([[Missouri]]) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday.\n\nIn his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field.  Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants. He was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom.\n\nMathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, Mathewson published his classic memoir ''Pitching in a Pinch,'' or Pitching from the Inside,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pitching in a Pinch, or Baseball from the Inside|last=Mathewson|first=Christy|publisher=G.B.

The Netherlands, as a consociational state, was between 1857 and 1967 divided into four non-territorial [[Pillarisation|pillar]]s: [[Calvinist]], [[Catholic]], [[socialist]], and [[Secularism|general]], although until 1917 there was a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] (\"first past the post\") [[electoral system]] rather than a consociational one. In their heyday, each comprised tightly-organised groups, schools, universities, hospitals and newspapers, all divided along a pillarised social structure. The theory, according to Lijphart, focuses on the role of social elites, their agreement and co-operation, as the key to a stable democracy.\n\n== Characteristics==\nLijphart identifies four key characteristics of consociational democracies:<ref name=\"Lijphart 1977\">{{cite book|first=Arend|last=Lijphart|year=1977|title=Democracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyinplura0000lijp|url-access=registration|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-02494-0}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Explanation\n|-\n|Grand coalition\n|Elites of each pillar come together to rule in the interests of society because they recognize the dangers of non-cooperation.\n|-\n|Mutual veto\n|Consensus among the groups is required to confirm the majority rule.  Mutuality means that the [[minority group|minority]] is unlikely to successfully block the majority.  If one group blocks another on some matter, the latter are likely to block the former in return.\n|-\n|Proportionality\n|Representation is based on population. If one pillar accounts for 30% of the overall society, then they occupy 30% of the positions on the police force, in civil service, and in other national and civic segments of society.\n|-\n|Segmental autonomy\n|Creates a sense of individuality and allows for different culturally-based community laws.\n|}\n\nConsociational policies often have these characteristics:<ref>Lijphart, Arend; Crepaz, Markus M.

[[Pillarisation]] was \"seriously weakening\", even in the 1950s, cross-denominational co-operation was increasing, and formerly coherent political sub-cultures were dissolving. He argued that elites in the Netherlands were not motivated by preferences derived from the general interest, but rather by self-interest. They formed coalitions not to forge consociational negotiation between segments but to improve their parties' respective power. He argued that the Netherlands was \"stable\" in that it had few protests or riots, but that it was so before consociationalism, and that it was not stable from the standpoint of government turnover. He questioned the extent to which the Netherlands, or indeed any country labelled a consociational system, could be called a democracy, and whether calling a consociational country a democracy isn't somehow ruled out by definition. He believed that Lijphart suffered severe problems of rigor when identifying whether particular divisions were cleavages, whether particular cleavages were segmental, and whether particular cleavages were cross-cutting.<ref name=\"van Schendelen\"/>\n\n===Lustick on hegemonic control===\n[[Ian Lustick]] has argued that academics lack an alternative \"control\" approach for explaining stability in deeply divided societies and that this has resulted in the empirical overextension of consociational models.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Lustick|year=1979|jstor=2009992|title=Stability in deeply divided societies: Consociationalism versus control|journal=World Politics|volume=31|issue=3|pages=325\u201344|doi=10.2307/2009992}}</ref> Lustick argues that Lijphart has \"an impressionistic methodological posture, flexible rules for coding data, and an indefatigable, rhetorically seductive commitment to promoting consociationalism as a widely applicable principle of political engineering\",<ref name=\"Lustick 1997\">{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Lustick|year=1997|title=Lijphart, Lakatos, and consociationalism|journal=World Politics|volume=50|issue=1|pages=88\u2013117|doi=10.1017/S0043887100014738|jstor=25054028}}</ref> that results in him applying consociational theory to case studies that it does not fit. Furthermore, Lustick states that \"Lijphart's definition of 'accommodation' ... includes the elaborately specified claim that issues dividing polarized blocs are settled by leaders convinced of the need for settlement\".<ref name=\"Lustick 1997\"/>\n\n===Other criticisms===\nCritics point out that consociationalism is dangerous in a system of differing [[antagonist]]ic [[ideologies]], generally [[conservatism]] and [[communism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} They state that specific conditions must exist for three or more groups to develop a multi- system with strong leaders. This philosophy is dominated by elites, with those masses that are sidelined with the elites having less to lose if war breaks out. Consociationalism cannot be imperially applied. For example, it does not effectively apply to [[Austria]].  Critics also point to the failure of this line of reasoning in [[Lebanon]], a country that reverted to civil war. It only truly applies in [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the Netherlands, and not in more deeply divided societies. If one of three groups gets half plus one of the vote, then the other groups are in perpetual opposition, which is largely incompatible with consociationalism.\n\nConsociationalism focuses on diverging identities such as ethnicity instead of integrating identities such as class, institutionalizing and entrenching the former. Furthermore, it relies on rival co-operation, which is inherently unstable. It focuses on intrastate relations and neglects relations with other states. [[Donald L. Horowitz]] argues that consociationalism can lead to the reification of ethnic divisions, since \"grand coalitions are unlikely, because of the dynamics of intraethnic competition. The very act of forming a multiethnic coalition generates intraethnic competition \u2013 flanking \u2013 if it does not already exist\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Horowitz|year=1985|title=Ethnic Groups in Conflict|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo|url-access=registration|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo/page/575 575]|isbn=0-520-22706-9}}</ref> Consistent with Horowitz' claims, Dawn Brancati finds that federalism/territorial autonomy, an element of consociationalism, strengthens ethnic divisions if it is designed in a way that strengthens regional parties, which in turn encourage ethnic conflict.<ref>Dawn Brancati, ''Peace by Design: Managing Intrastate Conflict through Decentralization'', Oxford University Press, 2009,</ref>\n\nConsociationalism assumes that each group is cohesive and has strong leadership.  Although the minority can block decisions, this requires 100 per cent agreement. Rights are given to communities rather than individuals, leading to over-representation of some individuals in society and under-representation of others. Grand coalitions are unlikely to happen due to the dynamics of ethnic competition.  Each group seeks more power for itself. Consociationalists are criticized for focusing too much on the set up of institutions and not enough on transitional issues which go beyond such institutions. Finally, it is claimed that consociational institutions promote [[sectarianism]] and entrench existing identities.\n\n==Examples==\nThe political systems of a number of countries operate or used to operate on a consociational basis, including [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Politics of Cyprus#United Cyprus|Cyprus]] (effective 1960\u20131963),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Stefan|title=Disputed Territories: The Transnational Dynamics of Ethnic Conflict Settlement|date=2004 |publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=30\u201331|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QYTKZ0z6QygC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wippman|first1=David|editor1-last=Wippman|editor1-first=David|title=International Law and Ethnic Conflict|date=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=220|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uy1CCqO6qUIC|chapter=Practical and Legal Constraints on Internal Power Sharing}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bahcheli|first1=Tozun|last2=Noel|first2=Sid|editor1-last=Noel|editor1-first=Sid|title=Relations of Ruling: Class and Gender in Postindustrial Societies|date=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|page=215|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=oQHX2Xz185EC|chapter=Power Sharing for Cyprus (Again)?

The Netherlands, as a consociational state, was between 1857 and 1967 divided into four non-territorial [[Pillarisation|pillar]]s: [[Calvinist]], [[Catholic]], [[socialist]], and [[Secularism|general]], although until 1917 there was a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] (\"first past the post\") [[electoral system]] rather than a consociational one. In their heyday, each comprised tightly-organised groups, schools, universities, hospitals and newspapers, all divided along a pillarised social structure. The theory, according to Lijphart, focuses on the role of social elites, their agreement and co-operation, as the key to a stable democracy.\n\n== Characteristics==\nLijphart identifies four key characteristics of consociational democracies:<ref name=\"Lijphart 1977\">{{cite book|first=Arend|last=Lijphart|year=1977|title=Democracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyinplura0000lijp|url-access=registration|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-02494-0}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Explanation\n|-\n|Grand coalition\n|Elites of each pillar come together to rule in the interests of society because they recognize the dangers of non-cooperation.\n|-\n|Mutual veto\n|Consensus among the groups is required to confirm the majority rule.

[[Pillarisation]] was \"seriously weakening\", even in the 1950s, cross-denominational co-operation was increasing, and formerly coherent political sub-cultures were dissolving. He argued that elites in the Netherlands were not motivated by preferences derived from the general interest, but rather by self-interest. They formed coalitions not to forge consociational negotiation between segments but to improve their parties' respective power. He argued that the Netherlands was \"stable\" in that it had few protests or riots, but that it was so before consociationalism, and that it was not stable from the standpoint of government turnover. He questioned the extent to which the Netherlands, or indeed any country labelled a consociational system, could be called a democracy, and whether calling a consociational country a democracy isn't somehow ruled out by definition. He believed that Lijphart suffered severe problems of rigor when identifying whether particular divisions were cleavages, whether particular cleavages were segmental, and whether particular cleavages were cross-cutting.<ref name=\"van Schendelen\"/>\n\n===Lustick on hegemonic control===\n[[Ian Lustick]] has argued that academics lack an alternative \"control\" approach for explaining stability in deeply divided societies and that this has resulted in the empirical overextension of consociational models.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Lustick|year=1979|jstor=2009992|title=Stability in deeply divided societies: Consociationalism versus control|journal=World Politics|volume=31|issue=3|pages=325\u201344|doi=10.2307/2009992}}</ref> Lustick argues that Lijphart has \"an impressionistic methodological posture, flexible rules for coding data, and an indefatigable, rhetorically seductive commitment to promoting consociationalism as a widely applicable principle of political engineering\",<ref name=\"Lustick 1997\">{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Lustick|year=1997|title=Lijphart, Lakatos, and consociationalism|journal=World Politics|volume=50|issue=1|pages=88\u2013117|doi=10.1017/S0043887100014738|jstor=25054028}}</ref> that results in him applying consociational theory to case studies that it does not fit. Furthermore, Lustick states that \"Lijphart's definition of 'accommodation' ... includes the elaborately specified claim that issues dividing polarized blocs are settled by leaders convinced of the need for settlement\".<ref name=\"Lustick 1997\"/>\n\n===Other criticisms===\nCritics point out that consociationalism is dangerous in a system of differing [[antagonist]]ic [[ideologies]], generally [[conservatism]] and [[communism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} They state that specific conditions must exist for three or more groups to develop a multi- system with strong leaders. This philosophy is dominated by elites, with those masses that are sidelined with the elites having less to lose if war breaks out. Consociationalism cannot be imperially applied. For example, it does not effectively apply to [[Austria]].  Critics also point to the failure of this line of reasoning in [[Lebanon]], a country that reverted to civil war. It only truly applies in [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the Netherlands, and not in more deeply divided societies. If one of three groups gets half plus one of the vote, then the other groups are in perpetual opposition, which is largely incompatible with consociationalism.\n\nConsociationalism focuses on diverging identities such as ethnicity instead of integrating identities such as class, institutionalizing and entrenching the former. Furthermore, it relies on rival co-operation, which is inherently unstable. It focuses on intrastate relations and neglects relations with other states. [[Donald L. Horowitz]] argues that consociationalism can lead to the reification of ethnic divisions, since \"grand coalitions are unlikely, because of the dynamics of intraethnic competition. The very act of forming a multiethnic coalition generates intraethnic competition \u2013 flanking \u2013 if it does not already exist\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Horowitz|year=1985|title=Ethnic Groups in Conflict|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo|url-access=registration|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo/page/575 575]|isbn=0-520-22706-9}}</ref> Consistent with Horowitz' claims, Dawn Brancati finds that federalism/territorial autonomy, an element of consociationalism, strengthens ethnic divisions if it is designed in a way that strengthens regional parties, which in turn encourage ethnic conflict.<ref>Dawn Brancati, ''Peace by Design: Managing Intrastate Conflict through Decentralization'', Oxford University Press, 2009,</ref>\n\nConsociationalism assumes that each group is cohesive and has strong leadership.  Although the minority can block decisions, this requires 100 per cent agreement. Rights are given to communities rather than individuals, leading to over-representation of some individuals in society and under-representation of others. Grand coalitions are unlikely to happen due to the dynamics of ethnic competition.  Each group seeks more power for itself. Consociationalists are criticized for focusing too much on the set up of institutions and not enough on transitional issues which go beyond such institutions. Finally, it is claimed that consociational institutions promote [[sectarianism]] and entrench existing identities.\n\n==Examples==\nThe political systems of a number of countries operate or used to operate on a consociational basis, including [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Politics of Cyprus#United Cyprus|Cyprus]] (effective 1960\u20131963),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Stefan|title=Disputed Territories: The Transnational Dynamics of Ethnic Conflict Settlement|date=2004 |publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=30\u201331|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QYTKZ0z6QygC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wippman|first1=David|editor1-last=Wippman|editor1-first=David|title=International Law and Ethnic Conflict|date=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=220|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uy1CCqO6qUIC|chapter=Practical and Legal Constraints on Internal Power Sharing}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bahcheli|first1=Tozun|last2=Noel|first2=Sid|editor1-last=Noel|editor1-first=Sid|title=Relations of Ruling: Class and Gender in Postindustrial Societies|date=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|page=215|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=oQHX2Xz185EC|chapter=Power Sharing for Cyprus (Again)?

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]].

In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world's first plasma donation center.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thirteen years after the center's opening, Dr. Grifols unexpectedly passed away at the young age of 41 due to leukemia. \n\n===Blood for Britain===  <!-- subject of redirect -->\nThe \"Blood for Britain\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the [[Race (human classification)|race]] of the [[blood donation|donor]].

When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate).

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]]. Prior to the United States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and [[whole blood]] were used.\n\n=== The Origin of Plasmapheresis ===\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Grifols Lucas, a scientist from Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grifols.com/documents/51507592/51526363/when-a-dream-comes-true.pdf/c0ebb294-4db1-4826-95b6-e9468aa9305c|title=When a Dream Comes True|date=January 2015|website=grifols.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, founded Laboratorios Grifols in 1940<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovertheplasma.com/documents/15447917/15449136/biography_ja_grifols.pdf/036f08c5-630b-4e4b-b590-985b4e951495|title=Biography: J.A.

Dr. Grifols pioneered a first-of-its-kind technique called ''plasmapheresis''<ref name=\":12\" />, where a donor's red blood cells would be returned to the donor's body almost immediately after the separation of the blood plasma. This technique is still in practice today, almost 80 years later. In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world's first plasma donation center.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thirteen years after the center's opening, Dr. Grifols unexpectedly passed away at the young age of 41 due to leukemia. \n\n===Blood for Britain===  <!-- subject of redirect -->\nThe \"Blood for Britain\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the [[Race (human classification)|race]] of the [[blood donation|donor]]. Drew insisted that there was no racial difference in human blood and that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for \"same race\" blood.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hirsch|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Donald Hirsch, Jr.|title=What Your 1st Grader Needs to Know: Fundamentals of a Good First-Grade Education|url=https://archive.org/details/whatyour3rdgrade00edhi|url-access=registration|publisher=New York: Doubleday|series=pp 232\u2013233|year=1991|doi= |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war the [[American Red Cross]] had provided enough blood for over six million plasma packages. Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. [[Serum albumin]] replaced dried plasma for combat use during the [[Korean War]].<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter11.htm The Plasma Program]</ref>\n\n==Plasma donation==\nPlasma as a [[blood product]] prepared from [[blood donation]]s is used in [[blood transfusion]]s, typically as [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or [[plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy]] (PF24). When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate). However, plasma from UK donors is still not used for the commercial manufacture of fractionated plasma medicines.\n\n==Synthetic blood plasma==\n[[Simulated body fluid]] (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma.

During [[solar eclipse]]s viewed from a point to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the Moon moves from left to right on the disc of the Sun (see, for example, photos with timings of the [[solar eclipse of November 13, 2012]]), while viewed from a point to the north of the Tropic of Cancer (i.e.,&nbsp;in the Northern Hemisphere), the Moon moves from right to left during solar eclipses.\n\nCyclones and tropical storms spin clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (as opposed to [[anticlockwise]] in the Northern Hemisphere) due to the [[Coriolis effect]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/currents/05currents1.html | title=Surface Ocean Currents | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe southern [[temperateness|temperate zone]], a subsection of the Southern Hemisphere, is nearly all oceanic.

This, combined with clearer skies, makes for excellent viewing of the night sky from the Southern Hemisphere with brighter and more numerous stars.\n\nForests in the Southern Hemisphere have special features which set them apart from those in the Northern Hemisphere. Both Chile and Australia share, for example, unique [[beech]] species or ''[[Nothofagus]]'', and New Zealand has members of the closely related genera ''[[Lophozonia]]'' and ''[[Fuscospora]]''.

The most important financial and commercial centers in the Southern Hemisphere are [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where the [[B3 (stock exchange)|Bovespa Index]] is headquartered, along with [[Sydney]], home to the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], [[Johannesburg]], home to the [[JSE Limited|Johannesburg Stock Exchange]], and Buenos Aires, headquarters of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the oldest stock market in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAmong the most developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere is Australia, with a nominal GDP ''per capita'' of US$53,825 and a [[human development index]] (HDI) of 0.938, the sixth-highest in the world as of the 2019 report. New Zealand is also well developed, with a nominal GDP ''per capita'' of US$41,616 and an HDI of 0.921, putting it at number 14 in the world in 2019. The least developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere cluster in Africa and Oceania, with [[Mozambique]] and [[Burundi]] at the lowest ends of the HDI, at 0.446 (number 180 in the world) and 0.423 (number 185 in the world), respectively. The nominal GDPs ''per capita'' of these two countries do not go above US$550, a tiny fraction of the incomes enjoyed by Australians and New Zealanders.\n\nThe most widespread religions in the Southern Hemisphere are [[Christianity]] in South America, Southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand, followed by [[Islam]] in most of the islands of Indonesia and in parts of southeastern Africa, and [[Hinduism]], which is mostly concentrated on the island of [[Bali]] and neighboring islands.\n\nThe oldest continuously inhabited city in the Southern Hemisphere is [[Bogor]], in western [[Java]], which was founded in 669 CE. Ancient texts from the Hindu kingdoms prevalent in the area definitively record 669 CE as the year when Bogor was founded. However,  some evidence shows that [[Zanzibar City|Zanzibar]], an ancient port with around 200,000 inhabitants on the coast of [[Tanzania]], may be older than Bogor. A Greco-Roman text written between 1 and 100 CE, the [[Periplus of the Erythrean Sea|''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']], mentioned the island of ''Menuthias'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: \u039c\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) as a trading port on the east African coast, which is probably the small island of [[Unguja]] on which Zanzibar is located. The oldest monumental civilizations in the Southern Hemisphere are the [[Norte Chico civilization]] and [[Casma\u2013Sechin culture]] from the northern coast of Peru.
