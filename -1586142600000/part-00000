[[Houghton Mifflin]])]]\n\n'''''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men''''' is a book with text by American writer [[James Agee]] and photographs by American photographer [[Walker Evans]], first published in 1941 in the United States. The work documents the lives of impoverished tenant farmers during the [[Great Depression]]. Although it is in keeping with Evans' work with the [[Farm Security Administration]], the project was initiated not by the FSA, but by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''   magazine. The title derives from a passage in the [[Wisdom of Sirach]] (44:1) that begins, \"[[De viris illustribus|Let us now praise famous men]], and our fathers that begat us\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Frank Tengle, Bud Fields, and Floyd Burroughs, cotton sharecroppers, Hale County, Alabama.jpg|right|thumb|Walker Evans photograph of three sharecroppers, Frank Tengle, Bud Fields, and Floyd Burroughs, Alabama, Summer 1936]]\n''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' grew out of an assignment that Agee and Evans accepted in 1936 to produce a ''Fortune'' article on the conditions among [[sharecropper]] families in the [[Southern United States|American South]] during the \"Dust Bowl\". It was the time of U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s \"[[New Deal]]\" programs designed to help the poorest segments of the society. Agee and Evans spent eight weeks that summer researching their assignment, mainly among three white sharecropping families mired in desperate poverty. They returned with Evans' portfolio of stark images&mdash;of families with gaunt faces, adults and children huddled in bare shacks before dusty yards in the Depression-era nowhere of the deep south&mdash;and Agee's detailed notes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/188 188]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/188}}</ref> \n\nAs he remarks in the book's preface, the original assignment was to produce a \"photographic and verbal record of the daily living and environment of an average white family of tenant farmers\". However, as the ''Literary Encyclopedia'' points out, \"Agee ultimately conceived of the project as a work of several volumes to be entitled ''Three Tenant Families'', though only the first volume, ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'', was ever written\". Agee considered that the larger work, though based in journalism, would be \"an independent inquiry into certain normal predicaments of human divinity\".\n\n==Agee as a character==\nAgee, who writes modestly and self-consciously about his privileged position in the book's creation, appears as a character himself at times in the narrative, as when he agonizes over his role as \"spy\" and intruder into these humble lives. At other times, as when he simply lists the contents of a sharecropper's shack or the meager articles of clothing they have to wear on Sunday, he is altogether absent. The strange ordering of books and chapters, the titles that range from mundane (\"Clothes\") to \"radically artistic\" (as the ''New York Times'' put it), the direct appeals by Agee for the reader to see the humanity and grandeur of these horrible lives, and his suffering at the thought that he cannot accomplish his appointed task, or should not, for the additional suffering it inflicts on his subjects, are all part of the book's character.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Agee|first1=James|last2=Evans|first2=Walker|title=Let Us Now Praise Famous Men: Three Tenant Families|date=1969|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nScholars have noted that the book's ambitious scale and rejection of traditional reporting runs parallel with the creative, non-traditional programs of the U.S. government under Roosevelt. Agee argues with literary, political, and moral traditions that might mean nothing to his subjects but which are important for the larger audience and the larger context of examining others' lives.\n\n''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' sold only half its press run following publication, but since then has won high praise over the years and is routinely studied in the U.S. as a source of both journalistic and literary innovation.  Reading the book inspired [[Aaron Copland]] to write his opera, ''[[The Tender Land]]''.<ref>Everett, Horace  and Copland, Aaron, \"The Tender Land: An Opera in Two Acts: Synopsis\" (Spring 1954).

They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019.

He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women.

All of these lines are electrified at overhead 1500 V DC, starting in 1926. Some of the suburban stations are also served by the intercity and regional trains operated by NSW TrainLink.\n\nMost suburban services operate through central Sydney via the underground City Circle (not a true circle line but a two-way loop extending under the CBD from Central station), the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs line]], or over the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]]. There have been long term plans for a new underground line passing beneath [[Pitt Street]] to a new harbour crossing. This line is currently in the advanced planning stages as a [[rapid transit]] line, with construction expected from 2017-2024.\n\nTimetables are published for all lines, and most lines run on minimum frequencies of every 15 minutes from early morning to midnight, 7 days a week. Frequencies are higher during peak periods and over shared routes. Although frequencies match [[rapid transit|metro]] style operation in the city core, few Sydneysiders use the underground network as a metro, most journeys being commuter trips from suburbs into the central city area. An exception to this is the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs line]] which serves the high density inner eastern suburbs and opened in 1979.\n\n===Rolling stock===\n{{main|Rail rolling stock in New South Wales}}\nAll suburban passenger trains in Sydney are double-deck [[Electric Multiple Unit|electric multiple unit]]s. Upon electrification in the 1920s Sydney operated single-deck multiple units but these were progressively withdrawn from the 1960s until their final demise in 1993. Single-deck automatic trains were reintroduced to Sydney in May 2019, with the completion of the [[Sydney Metro Northwest]].\n\n===Depots===\nElectric cars are maintained at depots at [[Hornsby Maintenance Depot|Hornsby]] in the northern suburbs, [[Mortdale Maintenance Depot|Mortdale]] in the southern suburbs, and [[Flemington Maintenance Depot|Flemington]] in the western suburbs. A depot at [[Punchbowl Maintenance Depot|Punchbowl]] in the southwest closed in 1994 and has since been demolished. These four depots were all built and opened with the opening of electrified services in the 1920s.\n\nHeavy maintenance of passenger cars was carried out at the [[Electric Carriage Workshops]], [[Chullora]] and [[Eveleigh Carriage Workshops|Suburban Car Workshops]], [[Redfern railway station|Redfern]]. Heavy maintenance is now contracted out to Maintrain, a [[UGL Rail]] subsidiary, with workshops at [[Clyde, New South Wales|Clyde]].\n\n==Freight services==\nFreight services operate over most of the suburban railway lines in Sydney, however due to the high frequency of passenger services and the lack of freight only tracks, there is a curfew on freight movements during peak hours.<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/sharing-tracks-in-sydney.html\n|title=Sharing tracks in Sydney\n|work=Railway Gazette\n|date=29 Jul 2008 \n|author=Ian Imrie\n|publisher=www.railwaygazette.com\n|accessdate=2008-08-16\n}}</ref>\n\nThe major interstate freight routes are the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main Southern]] and [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North]] lines, with the [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|Illawarra]] and [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Main Western]] lines serving lineside industries and as alternate interstate routes.

The North Shore line opened in 1893 to a harbour side station at Milson's Point, and was originally built because parliament thought it would be a shorter route for country produce from the north to Sydney Harbour (a role it has never fulfilled).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Sydney's first deliberately suburban railway was a line to Belmore which opened in 1896 and was soon extended to [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]].\n\nSydney's suburban passenger service was severely hampered by the inconvenient location of its city terminus, at a site south of Devonshire Street. Most of Sydney's population was well served by [[Trams in Sydney|trams]], and the suburban railways had a relatively small initial role to play. This was to change in the 1920s.\n\nThe railway system as it exists today is really the result of the vision and foresight of [[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]], one of Australia's most respected and famous civil engineers. He was involved in the design and construction of [[Sydney underground railways]] in the 1920s and 1930s, but he is more famous for the associated design and construction of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].<ref>Spearritt, P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Vt49nQqVkYC&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=bradfield+plan+train#PPA135,M1 ''Sydney's Century: A History''] Retrieved 9 September 2011</ref> Bradfield's vision for metro-style subways in Sydney was inspired by the subways he observed in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[New York City]].\n\n===Electrification===\n[[File:Bradfield Scheme Sydney CBD Railways alt.png|thumb|The original railway network for Sydney CBD planned by [[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]].]]\nNew South Wales uses an overhead electrification system at 1,500 [[Volt|volts]] [[direct current]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extranet.artc.com.au/docs/eng/comms/procedures/CDS03.pdf|title=Modification to Specs|publisher=ARTC|accessdate=9 September 2011}}</ref> Whilst inferior to and more expensive than modern single phase alternating current equipment, it was in vogue during the 1920s, having been used in Melbourne since 1919 and is generally sufficient for the operation of electric multiple unit trains. However, the introduction of powerful electric locomotives in the 1950s, followed by the [[Sydney Trains M set|Millennium train]] in 2002, revealed drawbacks in this antiquated system of electrification. As the voltage is relatively low, high currents are required to supply a given amount of power, which necessitates the use of very heavy duty cabling and substation equipment. Until the retirement of electric locomotives from freight service in the 1990s, it was often necessary to observe a \"power margin\" to ensure that substations were not overloaded. This situation was similar to that which applied to [[The Milwaukee Road]]'s 3,000 VDC electrification. Plans to electrify the Hunter Valley at 25 kV alternating current were abandoned in the 1990s.\n\nElectrification came to Sydney's suburbs on 9 December 1926 with the first suburban electric service running between Central station and [[Oatley railway station|Oatley]] on the [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra line]].{{sfn|Churchman|1995|p= 79f}} In the same year, the first underground railway was constructed north from Central station to [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James]] in Sydney's central business district. Electric trains that had previously terminated at Central station continued north, diving underground at the [[Goulburn Street]] tunnel portal, stopping at [[Museum railway station, Sydney|Museum station]] and then terminating at St James.<ref>''Jubilee of Sydney's Electric Trains'' Brady, I.A. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], March 1976 pp41-66</ref> Other lines were soon electrified. Also, in conjunction with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge which opened in 1932, an additional four-track underground line was constructed from Central station to [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall]] and [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]]. Two of the tracks continued over the Harbour Bridge connecting to the [[North Shore railway line|North Shore line]].\n\nIt was only in 1956 that the two tracks terminating at Wynyard were linked to the line terminating at St James via the Circular Quay viaduct. This new arrangement, dubbed the [[City Circle]], allowed services to make a continuous run through the city and return to the suburbs without having to terminate.\n\n===Electrification timeline===\n* '''1926''' \u2013 [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra line]] to [[Royal National Park railway station|Royal National Park]]\n* '''1926''' \u2013 [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]]\n* '''1927''' \u2013 [[North Shore railway line|North Shore line]]\n* '''1929''' \u2013 [[Main Western railway line|Western line]] to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]]\n* '''1929''' \u2013 [[Main Northern railway line|Northern line]] ([[Strathfield railway station|Strathfield]] to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]])\n* '''1929''' \u2013 [[Main Southern railway line|South line]] to [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]]\n* '''1936''' \u2013 [[Carlingford railway line|Carlingford line]] from [[Clyde railway station, Sydney|Clyde]] to [[Rosehill railway station|Rosehill]]\n* '''1955''' \u2013 Parramatta to [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith]]\n* '''1957''' \u2013 Penrith to [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow]]\n* '''1959''' \u2013 Rosehill to [[Carlingford railway station|Carlingford]]\n* '''1959''' \u2013 Hornsby to [[Cowan railway station|Cowan]]\n* '''1960''' \u2013 Cowan to [[Gosford railway station|Gosford]]\n* '''1968''' \u2013 Liverpool to [[Campbelltown railway station|Campbelltown]]\n* '''1975''' \u2013 [[Blacktown railway station|Blacktown]] to [[Riverstone railway station|Riverstone]]\n* '''1980''' \u2013 [[Loftus railway station, Sydney|Loftus]] to [[Waterfall railway station, Sydney|Waterfall]]\n* '''1982''' \u2013 Gosford to [[Wyong railway station|Wyong]]\n* '''1984''' \u2013 Wyong to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]]\n* '''1985''' \u2013 Waterfall to [[Port Kembla railway station|Port Kembla]].\n* '''1985''' \u2013 [[Macarthur railway station|Macarthur station]] opened\n* '''1991''' \u2013 Riverstone to [[Richmond railway station, Sydney|Richmond]]\n* '''1996''' \u2013 [[Coniston railway station, New South Wales|Coniston]] to [[Dapto railway station|Dapto]]\n* '''2002''' \u2013 Dapto to [[Kiama railway station|Kiama]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4801141 | title=Kiama Railway Station Group and Turntable | publisher=NSW Environment & Heritage www.environment.nsw.gov.au/ | date=February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nNew electrified lines were built:\n\n* '''1926''' \u2013 line from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] to [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James station]] and [[Museum railway station|Museum]] opened\n* '''1931''' \u2013 line opened to [[East Hills railway station|East Hills]]\n* '''1932''' \u2013 line from Central to [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall]], [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]], the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], [[Milsons Point railway station|Milsons Point station]] and [[North Sydney railway station|North Sydney station]] opened\n* '''1939''' \u2013  Line to [[Cronulla railway station|Cronulla]] built and connected with the Illawarra line at [[Sutherland railway station|Sutherland]]\n* '''1956''' \u2013 [[Circular Quay railway station|Circular Quay station]] opened completing the [[City Circle]]\n* '''1979''' \u2013 [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs railway]] completed to [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]]\n* '''1987''' \u2013 East Hills \u2013 [[Glenfield railway station, Sydney|Glenfield]] line opened\n* '''1996''' \u2013 Y-link built between Harris Park and Merrylands allowing the introduction of [[Cumberland railway line|Cumberland line]] services from Campbelltown to Blacktown\n* '''1998''' \u2013 line from [[Flemington railway station, Sydney|Flemington]] and [[Lidcombe railway station|Lidcombe]] to [[Olympic Park railway line|Olympic Park]].\n* '''2000''' \u2013 line to [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Sydney Airport]] and [[Wolli Creek railway station|Wolli Creek]] built as a [[public-private partnership]] by the [[Airport Link Company]]\n* '''2009''' \u2013 [[Epping to Chatswood railway line]] opened\n* '''2015''' \u2013 [[South West Rail Link]] opened\n* '''2019''' \u2013 [[Sydney Metro Northwest]] opened\n\n==Organisation==\nThe rail network in the metropolitan area of Sydney is owned, maintained and operated by [[RailCorp]], a NSW State Government owned corporation. Third party access to Railcorp's tracks by other freight operators is allowed under an open-access arrangement. Track outside the Sydney metropolitan area is operated and maintained by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]]. Suburban passenger trains within Sydney are operated by [[Sydney Trains]] and long distance trains that run through Sydney are operated by [[NSW TrainLink]].\n\nRailCorp was formed on 1 January 2004 by the merger of the [[State Rail Authority]] (SRA) and the metropolitan functions of the [[Rail Infrastructure Corporation]] (RIC). Until 1972, railways in NSW were operated by the [[Department of Railways New South Wales]] until this department was replaced by the [[Public Transport Commission]] (PTC), which was also responsible for bus and ferry services. In 1980 the PTC was broken up into the SRA, responsible for rail services, and the [[Urban Transit Authority]] (UTA), responsible for bus and ferry services. The UTA later became the [[State Transit Authority]] in 1989.\n\nIn 2001, the SRA had its 'above track' operations separated from its track ownership and maintenance operations. The track maintenance operations and track ownership were moved to the new RIC. However this separation into a horizontally operated rail system was criticised for the passing of blame for rail delays and accidents between authorities, and in 2004 railways in Sydney became a vertically operated system again with the creation of RailCorp, a fusion of the SRA and the urban sections of the RIC.\n\nIn July 2013, RailCorp was reduced to become the owner of the infrastructure and rolling stock, with the service provision that it operated under the [[CityRail]] and [[CountryLink]] brands transferred to [[Sydney Trains]] and [[NSW TrainLink]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/railcorp-job-cuts-first-of-many-unions-20120515-1yo93.html#ixzz1uwKcuUpH \"RailCorp job cuts first of many: unions\"] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 15 May 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-news/ruthless-railcorp-reforms-planned-as-middle-management-axed/story-fnb5f12x-1226355250747 \"Ruthless RailCorp reforms planned as middle management axed\"] ''[[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 May 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.railcorp.info/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/7021/RailCorp_Corporate_Plan.pdf Corporate Plan 2012/13] RailCorp</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/jobs-to-go-as-railcorp-gets-the-axe/story-e6freuy9-1226517985059 700 jobs to go as RailCorp gets the axe] ''Daily Telegraph'' 16 November 2012</ref>\n\n==Gauge==\nAll trains in Sydney use [[standard gauge]], with a [[Rail gauge|distance]] of {{RailGauge|1435mm}} between the rails.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe railways in Sydney generally use British-derived terminology.\n* '''Points''' refers to what in American English are known as [[railroad switch]]es, or crossovers.\n* '''Up''' refers to the direction \"towards Sydney\", where 'Sydney' is generally defined as Central Station.\n* '''Down''' refers to the direction \"away from Sydney\", or \"towards the country\".\n* '''Signal box''' refers to the signal control installation ('''tower''' in American terminology).\n\n==Railway lines==\n\n===Mainlines===\nFour main 'trunk' lines radiate from Sydney to the north, south, west, and southwest:\n* The '''[[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Main Western railway line]]''' from Central through Strathfield and west to Penrith and western NSW.\n* The '''[[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North railway line]]''' from Strathfield north to Hornsby and on to northern NSW\n* The '''[[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main Southern railway line]]''' from Lidcombe through Regents Park and Cabramatta and southern NSW\n* The '''[[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast railway line]]''' (also known as Illawarra railway line) from Redfern south to Sutherland and on to Wollongong and the South Coast.\n\n===Other suburban lines===\nOther passenger lines branch from or interconnect with the four main lines:\n* The '''[[Airport Link, Sydney|Airport Link]]''', an underground line linking the airport to the city.\n* The '''[[Bankstown railway line]]''', from Sydenham to Lidcombe via Bankstown\n* The '''[[City Circle]]''', a mostly underground loop in central Sydney\n* The '''[[Cronulla railway line]]''', from Sutherland to Cronulla\n* The '''[[East Hills railway line]]''', from Tempe to Glenfield via East Hills.\n* The '''[[Eastern Suburbs railway line]]''', a mostly underground line from Central to Bondi Junction\n* The '''[[North Shore railway line]]''', from Central to Hornsby via the Harbour Bridge\n* The '''[[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Old Main South railway line]]''', from Granville to Cabramatta via Fairfield\n* The '''[[Olympic Park railway line]]''', a balloon loop line between Lidcombe and Olympic Park\n* The '''[[Richmond railway line]]''', from Blacktown to Richmond\n* The '''[[South West Rail Link]]''', from Glenfield to Leppington.\n\n===Rapid Transit lines===\n* The '''[[Sydney Metro Northwest]]''', from Tallawong to Chatswood\n** Includes the converted '''[[Epping to Chatswood rail link]]''', an underground line connecting the North Shore and Main Northern lines, and serving the Macquarie Park employment area.\n\n=== Light rail lines ===\n[[File:Historical tram - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|A former Brisbane tram departing [[Royal National Park railway station|Royal National Park station]] for the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] in Loftus]]\nLines with [[light rail]] specifications:\n* The '''[[Dulwich Hill Line]]''' (otherwise known as the '''Inner West Light Rail'''), from Central to Dulwich Hill.

Central and Circular Quay are above-ground stations (Circular Quay is elevated, directly underneath the Cahill Expressway), while the remainder are below ground. The line to St. James station and Museum was opened in 1926, but Circular Quay was a \"missing link\" until 1956.  The \"western limb\" of the City Circle through Town Hall and Wynyard to [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] opened in 1932, in conjunction with the opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. \n*The second, the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs line]], opened in 1979. It runs between [[Redfern railway station|Redfern]], Central, Town Hall, [[Martin Place railway station|Martin Place]], [[Kings Cross railway station, Sydney|Kings Cross]], [[Edgecliff railway station|Edgecliff]], Woollahra (Unused Platforms) and [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]] stations.  All these are underground, but there are three above-ground sections, two on viaduct and one in cutting. Most of the [[railway platform|platforms]] at Redfern and Central stations are above ground, including the platforms for the City Circle, but the Eastern Suburbs line is underground. At the time of its construction, the line had been intended to finish at [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]] but it was curtailed at Bondi Junction for political reasons.  In the late 1990s, there were plans to extend the line to [[Bondi Beach]], but these have since fallen through. \n*The third underground line is the [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Airport Line]], which opened in 2000, prior to the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]]. This serves Central, Green Square, [[Mascot railway station|Mascot]], [[Domestic railway station, Sydney|Domestic]] (underneath the Domestic terminals), [[International railway station, Sydney|International]] (underneath International terminal at Sydney Airport), and [[Wolli Creek railway station|Wolli Creek]]. After Wolli Creek it joins the above-ground East Hills line at [[Turrella railway station|Turrella]].\n*The fourth underground line is the [[Epping to Chatswood railway line|Epping to Chatswood rail link]], opened in 2009. It links [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]] to [[Epping railway station, Sydney|Epping]], with new underground platforms at Epping and new underground stations at [[Macquarie University railway station|Macquarie University]], [[Macquarie Park railway station|Macquarie Park]] and [[North Ryde railway station|North Ryde]]. The line was intended to continue from Epping to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]], incorporating the existing Carlingford line, but this section has been postponed indefinitely, though a stub tunnel has been constructed at the northern end of Epping station. It is now part of the new [[Sydney Metro|Northwest Metro]] with the Epping to Chatswood section converted from rail configuration to a rapid transit line.\n\n==== Disused tunnels ====\nSydney has several disused tunnels. The best known of these are those leading out of [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James station]]. There are also several disused tunnels and platforms on the Eastern Suburbs line, which like St James station provided for the possibility of four tunnels even though only two are in use. There is a stub tunnel at North Sydney railway station, north of platform 2, for a never constructed Manly to Mona Vale line.<ref>Besser, Linton, ''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/ghost-trains-the-forgotten-rail-network/2007/07/20/1184560040257.html \"Ghost trains: the rail network that never was\"]'', [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 21 July 2007.

One runs underneath [[Railway Square]], near the Central station railway yards. For a time, the line was used to service the [[Powerhouse Museum]]. The corridor adjacent to the tunnel is now a pedestrian pathway, the tunnel itself is disused. The second tunnel runs underneath [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] and is now part of the [[Dulwich Hill Line|Dulwich Hill light rail line]] from Central station (see [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]]). The third tunnel was created in 2000 when an extension to the [[City West Link Road]] through [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] was built on top of a cutting.

This line is currently in the advanced planning stages as a [[rapid transit]] line, with construction expected from 2017-2024.\n\nTimetables are published for all lines, and most lines run on minimum frequencies of every 15 minutes from early morning to midnight, 7 days a week. Frequencies are higher during peak periods and over shared routes. Although frequencies match [[rapid transit|metro]] style operation in the city core, few Sydneysiders use the underground network as a metro, most journeys being commuter trips from suburbs into the central city area. An exception to this is the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs line]] which serves the high density inner eastern suburbs and opened in 1979.\n\n===Rolling stock===\n{{main|Rail rolling stock in New South Wales}}\nAll suburban passenger trains in Sydney are double-deck [[Electric Multiple Unit|electric multiple unit]]s. Upon electrification in the 1920s Sydney operated single-deck multiple units but these were progressively withdrawn from the 1960s until their final demise in 1993. Single-deck automatic trains were reintroduced to Sydney in May 2019, with the completion of the [[Sydney Metro Northwest]].\n\n===Depots===\nElectric cars are maintained at depots at [[Hornsby Maintenance Depot|Hornsby]] in the northern suburbs, [[Mortdale Maintenance Depot|Mortdale]] in the southern suburbs, and [[Flemington Maintenance Depot|Flemington]] in the western suburbs. A depot at [[Punchbowl Maintenance Depot|Punchbowl]] in the southwest closed in 1994 and has since been demolished. These four depots were all built and opened with the opening of electrified services in the 1920s.\n\nHeavy maintenance of passenger cars was carried out at the [[Electric Carriage Workshops]], [[Chullora]] and [[Eveleigh Carriage Workshops|Suburban Car Workshops]], [[Redfern railway station|Redfern]]. Heavy maintenance is now contracted out to Maintrain, a [[UGL Rail]] subsidiary, with workshops at [[Clyde, New South Wales|Clyde]].\n\n==Freight services==\nFreight services operate over most of the suburban railway lines in Sydney, however due to the high frequency of passenger services and the lack of freight only tracks, there is a curfew on freight movements during peak hours.<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/sharing-tracks-in-sydney.html\n|title=Sharing tracks in Sydney\n|work=Railway Gazette\n|date=29 Jul 2008 \n|author=Ian Imrie\n|publisher=www.railwaygazette.com\n|accessdate=2008-08-16\n}}</ref>\n\nThe major interstate freight routes are the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main Southern]] and [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North]] lines, with the [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|Illawarra]] and [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Main Western]] lines serving lineside industries and as alternate interstate routes.

The railway formed the basis of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. Passenger and freight services were operated from the beginning.<ref>''The Centenary of the Sydney\u2013Parramatta Railway'' Singleton, C.C. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], September, 1955 pp109-131</ref> By 1880, there was half hourly service to [[Homebush railway station|Homebush]].\n\nIn 1884, the railway opened from Strathfield to Hornsby. The North Shore line opened in 1893 to a harbour side station at Milson's Point, and was originally built because parliament thought it would be a shorter route for country produce from the north to Sydney Harbour (a role it has never fulfilled).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Sydney's first deliberately suburban railway was a line to Belmore which opened in 1896 and was soon extended to [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]].\n\nSydney's suburban passenger service was severely hampered by the inconvenient location of its city terminus, at a site south of Devonshire Street. Most of Sydney's population was well served by [[Trams in Sydney|trams]], and the suburban railways had a relatively small initial role to play. This was to change in the 1920s.\n\nThe railway system as it exists today is really the result of the vision and foresight of [[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]], one of Australia's most respected and famous civil engineers. He was involved in the design and construction of [[Sydney underground railways]] in the 1920s and 1930s, but he is more famous for the associated design and construction of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].<ref>Spearritt, P.

However, the introduction of powerful electric locomotives in the 1950s, followed by the [[Sydney Trains M set|Millennium train]] in 2002, revealed drawbacks in this antiquated system of electrification. As the voltage is relatively low, high currents are required to supply a given amount of power, which necessitates the use of very heavy duty cabling and substation equipment. Until the retirement of electric locomotives from freight service in the 1990s, it was often necessary to observe a \"power margin\" to ensure that substations were not overloaded. This situation was similar to that which applied to [[The Milwaukee Road]]'s 3,000 VDC electrification. Plans to electrify the Hunter Valley at 25 kV alternating current were abandoned in the 1990s.\n\nElectrification came to Sydney's suburbs on 9 December 1926 with the first suburban electric service running between Central station and [[Oatley railway station|Oatley]] on the [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra line]].{{sfn|Churchman|1995|p= 79f}} In the same year, the first underground railway was constructed north from Central station to [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James]] in Sydney's central business district. Electric trains that had previously terminated at Central station continued north, diving underground at the [[Goulburn Street]] tunnel portal, stopping at [[Museum railway station, Sydney|Museum station]] and then terminating at St James.<ref>''Jubilee of Sydney's Electric Trains'' Brady, I.A. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], March 1976 pp41-66</ref> Other lines were soon electrified. Also, in conjunction with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge which opened in 1932, an additional four-track underground line was constructed from Central station to [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall]] and [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]]. Two of the tracks continued over the Harbour Bridge connecting to the [[North Shore railway line|North Shore line]].\n\nIt was only in 1956 that the two tracks terminating at Wynyard were linked to the line terminating at St James via the Circular Quay viaduct. This new arrangement, dubbed the [[City Circle]], allowed services to make a continuous run through the city and return to the suburbs without having to terminate.\n\n===Electrification timeline===\n* '''1926''' \u2013 [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra line]] to [[Royal National Park railway station|Royal National Park]]\n* '''1926''' \u2013 [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]]\n* '''1927''' \u2013 [[North Shore railway line|North Shore line]]\n* '''1929''' \u2013 [[Main Western railway line|Western line]] to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]]\n* '''1929''' \u2013 [[Main Northern railway line|Northern line]] ([[Strathfield railway station|Strathfield]] to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]])\n* '''1929''' \u2013 [[Main Southern railway line|South line]] to [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]]\n* '''1936''' \u2013 [[Carlingford railway line|Carlingford line]] from [[Clyde railway station, Sydney|Clyde]] to [[Rosehill railway station|Rosehill]]\n* '''1955''' \u2013 Parramatta to [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith]]\n* '''1957''' \u2013 Penrith to [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow]]\n* '''1959''' \u2013 Rosehill to [[Carlingford railway station|Carlingford]]\n* '''1959''' \u2013 Hornsby to [[Cowan railway station|Cowan]]\n* '''1960''' \u2013 Cowan to [[Gosford railway station|Gosford]]\n* '''1968''' \u2013 Liverpool to [[Campbelltown railway station|Campbelltown]]\n* '''1975''' \u2013 [[Blacktown railway station|Blacktown]] to [[Riverstone railway station|Riverstone]]\n* '''1980''' \u2013 [[Loftus railway station, Sydney|Loftus]] to [[Waterfall railway station, Sydney|Waterfall]]\n* '''1982''' \u2013 Gosford to [[Wyong railway station|Wyong]]\n* '''1984''' \u2013 Wyong to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]]\n* '''1985''' \u2013 Waterfall to [[Port Kembla railway station|Port Kembla]].\n* '''1985''' \u2013 [[Macarthur railway station|Macarthur station]] opened\n* '''1991''' \u2013 Riverstone to [[Richmond railway station, Sydney|Richmond]]\n* '''1996''' \u2013 [[Coniston railway station, New South Wales|Coniston]] to [[Dapto railway station|Dapto]]\n* '''2002''' \u2013 Dapto to [[Kiama railway station|Kiama]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4801141 | title=Kiama Railway Station Group and Turntable | publisher=NSW Environment & Heritage www.environment.nsw.gov.au/ | date=February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nNew electrified lines were built:\n\n* '''1926''' \u2013 line from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] to [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James station]] and [[Museum railway station|Museum]] opened\n* '''1931''' \u2013 line opened to [[East Hills railway station|East Hills]]\n* '''1932''' \u2013 line from Central to [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall]], [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]], the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], [[Milsons Point railway station|Milsons Point station]] and [[North Sydney railway station|North Sydney station]] opened\n* '''1939''' \u2013  Line to [[Cronulla railway station|Cronulla]] built and connected with the Illawarra line at [[Sutherland railway station|Sutherland]]\n* '''1956''' \u2013 [[Circular Quay railway station|Circular Quay station]] opened completing the [[City Circle]]\n* '''1979''' \u2013 [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs railway]] completed to [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]]\n* '''1987''' \u2013 East Hills \u2013 [[Glenfield railway station, Sydney|Glenfield]] line opened\n* '''1996''' \u2013 Y-link built between Harris Park and Merrylands allowing the introduction of [[Cumberland railway line|Cumberland line]] services from Campbelltown to Blacktown\n* '''1998''' \u2013 line from [[Flemington railway station, Sydney|Flemington]] and [[Lidcombe railway station|Lidcombe]] to [[Olympic Park railway line|Olympic Park]].\n* '''2000''' \u2013 line to [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Sydney Airport]] and [[Wolli Creek railway station|Wolli Creek]] built as a [[public-private partnership]] by the [[Airport Link Company]]\n* '''2009''' \u2013 [[Epping to Chatswood railway line]] opened\n* '''2015''' \u2013 [[South West Rail Link]] opened\n* '''2019''' \u2013 [[Sydney Metro Northwest]] opened\n\n==Organisation==\nThe rail network in the metropolitan area of Sydney is owned, maintained and operated by [[RailCorp]], a NSW State Government owned corporation. Third party access to Railcorp's tracks by other freight operators is allowed under an open-access arrangement. Track outside the Sydney metropolitan area is operated and maintained by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]]. Suburban passenger trains within Sydney are operated by [[Sydney Trains]] and long distance trains that run through Sydney are operated by [[NSW TrainLink]].\n\nRailCorp was formed on 1 January 2004 by the merger of the [[State Rail Authority]] (SRA) and the metropolitan functions of the [[Rail Infrastructure Corporation]] (RIC). Until 1972, railways in NSW were operated by the [[Department of Railways New South Wales]] until this department was replaced by the [[Public Transport Commission]] (PTC), which was also responsible for bus and ferry services. In 1980 the PTC was broken up into the SRA, responsible for rail services, and the [[Urban Transit Authority]] (UTA), responsible for bus and ferry services. The UTA later became the [[State Transit Authority]] in 1989.\n\nIn 2001, the SRA had its 'above track' operations separated from its track ownership and maintenance operations. The track maintenance operations and track ownership were moved to the new RIC. However this separation into a horizontally operated rail system was criticised for the passing of blame for rail delays and accidents between authorities, and in 2004 railways in Sydney became a vertically operated system again with the creation of RailCorp, a fusion of the SRA and the urban sections of the RIC.\n\nIn July 2013, RailCorp was reduced to become the owner of the infrastructure and rolling stock, with the service provision that it operated under the [[CityRail]] and [[CountryLink]] brands transferred to [[Sydney Trains]] and [[NSW TrainLink]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/railcorp-job-cuts-first-of-many-unions-20120515-1yo93.html#ixzz1uwKcuUpH \"RailCorp job cuts first of many: unions\"] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 15 May 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-news/ruthless-railcorp-reforms-planned-as-middle-management-axed/story-fnb5f12x-1226355250747 \"Ruthless RailCorp reforms planned as middle management axed\"] ''[[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 May 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.railcorp.info/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/7021/RailCorp_Corporate_Plan.pdf Corporate Plan 2012/13] RailCorp</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/jobs-to-go-as-railcorp-gets-the-axe/story-e6freuy9-1226517985059 700 jobs to go as RailCorp gets the axe] ''Daily Telegraph'' 16 November 2012</ref>\n\n==Gauge==\nAll trains in Sydney use [[standard gauge]], with a [[Rail gauge|distance]] of {{RailGauge|1435mm}} between the rails.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe railways in Sydney generally use British-derived terminology.\n* '''Points''' refers to what in American English are known as [[railroad switch]]es, or crossovers.\n* '''Up''' refers to the direction \"towards Sydney\", where 'Sydney' is generally defined as Central Station.\n* '''Down''' refers to the direction \"away from Sydney\", or \"towards the country\".\n* '''Signal box''' refers to the signal control installation ('''tower''' in American terminology).\n\n==Railway lines==\n\n===Mainlines===\nFour main 'trunk' lines radiate from Sydney to the north, south, west, and southwest:\n* The '''[[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Main Western railway line]]''' from Central through Strathfield and west to Penrith and western NSW.\n* The '''[[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North railway line]]''' from Strathfield north to Hornsby and on to northern NSW\n* The '''[[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main Southern railway line]]''' from Lidcombe through Regents Park and Cabramatta and southern NSW\n* The '''[[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast railway line]]''' (also known as Illawarra railway line) from Redfern south to Sutherland and on to Wollongong and the South Coast.\n\n===Other suburban lines===\nOther passenger lines branch from or interconnect with the four main lines:\n* The '''[[Airport Link, Sydney|Airport Link]]''', an underground line linking the airport to the city.\n* The '''[[Bankstown railway line]]''', from Sydenham to Lidcombe via Bankstown\n* The '''[[City Circle]]''', a mostly underground loop in central Sydney\n* The '''[[Cronulla railway line]]''', from Sutherland to Cronulla\n* The '''[[East Hills railway line]]''', from Tempe to Glenfield via East Hills.\n* The '''[[Eastern Suburbs railway line]]''', a mostly underground line from Central to Bondi Junction\n* The '''[[North Shore railway line]]''', from Central to Hornsby via the Harbour Bridge\n* The '''[[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Old Main South railway line]]''', from Granville to Cabramatta via Fairfield\n* The '''[[Olympic Park railway line]]''', a balloon loop line between Lidcombe and Olympic Park\n* The '''[[Richmond railway line]]''', from Blacktown to Richmond\n* The '''[[South West Rail Link]]''', from Glenfield to Leppington.\n\n===Rapid Transit lines===\n* The '''[[Sydney Metro Northwest]]''', from Tallawong to Chatswood\n** Includes the converted '''[[Epping to Chatswood rail link]]''', an underground line connecting the North Shore and Main Northern lines, and serving the Macquarie Park employment area.\n\n=== Light rail lines ===\n[[File:Historical tram - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|A former Brisbane tram departing [[Royal National Park railway station|Royal National Park station]] for the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] in Loftus]]\nLines with [[light rail]] specifications:\n* The '''[[Dulwich Hill Line]]''' (otherwise known as the '''Inner West Light Rail'''), from Central to Dulwich Hill.

Central and Circular Quay are above-ground stations (Circular Quay is elevated, directly underneath the Cahill Expressway), while the remainder are below ground. The line to St. James station and Museum was opened in 1926, but Circular Quay was a \"missing link\" until 1956.  The \"western limb\" of the City Circle through Town Hall and Wynyard to [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] opened in 1932, in conjunction with the opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. \n*The second, the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs line]], opened in 1979. It runs between [[Redfern railway station|Redfern]], Central, Town Hall, [[Martin Place railway station|Martin Place]], [[Kings Cross railway station, Sydney|Kings Cross]], [[Edgecliff railway station|Edgecliff]], Woollahra (Unused Platforms) and [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]] stations.  All these are underground, but there are three above-ground sections, two on viaduct and one in cutting. Most of the [[railway platform|platforms]] at Redfern and Central stations are above ground, including the platforms for the City Circle, but the Eastern Suburbs line is underground. At the time of its construction, the line had been intended to finish at [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]] but it was curtailed at Bondi Junction for political reasons.  In the late 1990s, there were plans to extend the line to [[Bondi Beach]], but these have since fallen through. \n*The third underground line is the [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Airport Line]], which opened in 2000, prior to the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]]. This serves Central, Green Square, [[Mascot railway station|Mascot]], [[Domestic railway station, Sydney|Domestic]] (underneath the Domestic terminals), [[International railway station, Sydney|International]] (underneath International terminal at Sydney Airport), and [[Wolli Creek railway station|Wolli Creek]]. After Wolli Creek it joins the above-ground East Hills line at [[Turrella railway station|Turrella]].\n*The fourth underground line is the [[Epping to Chatswood railway line|Epping to Chatswood rail link]], opened in 2009. It links [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]] to [[Epping railway station, Sydney|Epping]], with new underground platforms at Epping and new underground stations at [[Macquarie University railway station|Macquarie University]], [[Macquarie Park railway station|Macquarie Park]] and [[North Ryde railway station|North Ryde]]. The line was intended to continue from Epping to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]], incorporating the existing Carlingford line, but this section has been postponed indefinitely, though a stub tunnel has been constructed at the northern end of Epping station. It is now part of the new [[Sydney Metro|Northwest Metro]] with the Epping to Chatswood section converted from rail configuration to a rapid transit line.\n\n==== Disused tunnels ====\nSydney has several disused tunnels. The best known of these are those leading out of [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James station]]. There are also several disused tunnels and platforms on the Eastern Suburbs line, which like St James station provided for the possibility of four tunnels even though only two are in use. There is a stub tunnel at North Sydney railway station, north of platform 2, for a never constructed Manly to Mona Vale line.<ref>Besser, Linton, ''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/ghost-trains-the-forgotten-rail-network/2007/07/20/1184560040257.html \"Ghost trains: the rail network that never was\"]'', [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 21 July 2007.

There are at least nine railway tunnels under the suburb of Redfern: some in use, some never used.\n\nPlatforms 26 and 27 at Central lie above the Eastern Suburbs Railway platforms and have never been used for trains.<ref>Besser, Linton, ''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/on-the-rails-to-nowhere/2007/07/20/1184560040323.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 \"On the rails to nowhere\"]'', 21 July 2007. Accessed 21 July 2007.</ref> Like St. James station, these stations have stub tunnels, although they are much shorter.\n\nThere are three tunnels for the old Pyrmont goods line, not part of the passenger railway system. One runs underneath [[Railway Square]], near the Central station railway yards. For a time, the line was used to service the [[Powerhouse Museum]]. The corridor adjacent to the tunnel is now a pedestrian pathway, the tunnel itself is disused. The second tunnel runs underneath [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] and is now part of the [[Dulwich Hill Line|Dulwich Hill light rail line]] from Central station (see [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]]). The third tunnel was created in 2000 when an extension to the [[City West Link Road]] through [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] was built on top of a cutting. This is also now used by the light rail.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n* [[RailCorp]]\n* [[Sydney Trains]]\n* [[Rail transport in New South Wales]]\n** [[Rail rollingstock in New South Wales]]\n** [[Proposed railways in Sydney]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |title= Railway Electrification in Australia and New Zealand |last= Churchman |first= Geoffrey B.  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1995  |publisher= IPL Books |location= Wellington & Sydney |isbn= 0-908876-79-3 |url= }}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nswrail.net NSWRail.net]\n* [http://www.trainsandtrams.com/sydney-train-map/ Diagrammatic history of passenger railways in Sydney]\n\n{{Public transport in Sydney}}\n{{Australian rail}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Railways In Sydney}}\n[[Category:Rail transport in Sydney| ]]\n", "name_user": "Fork99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed minor typo and minor outdated info", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_in_Sydney"}

MD 99, which follows the original 18th-century road west from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], was constructed as part of three state highways: MD 99, the original MD 100, and MD 105.  All three highways were constructed between the early 1920s and early 1930s.  MD 99 originally turned south along St. Johns Lane to [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]] and [[Maryland Route 144|MD 144]]; in 1956, the state highway was rerouted along part of MD 100 and all of MD 105 to downtown Ellicott City.

Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017.

He insisted that, contrary to international law, if Ukraine signed the agreement, from a legal point of view, the Ukrainian government would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries' borders.

It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014.

Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017.

He insisted that, contrary to international law, if Ukraine signed the agreement, from a legal point of view, the Ukrainian government would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries' borders.

It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014.

The work was not heard in a complete public performance, however, until some years after it was completed. Although there were four performances between September 1918 and October 1920, they were all either private (the first performance, in London) or incomplete (two others in London and one in [[Birmingham]]). The premiere was at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 29 September 1918,{{sfn|Lebrecht|2008|p=240}} conducted by Holst's friend [[Adrian Boult]] before an invited audience of about 250 people.

The idea of the work was suggested to Holst by [[Clifford Bax]], who introduced him to astrology when the two were part of a small group of English artists holidaying in [[Majorca]] in the spring of 1913; Holst became quite a devotee of the subject, and would cast his friends' horoscopes for fun.<ref name=HolstLM/><ref name=Imogen/> Holst also used [[Alan Leo]]'s<ref name=HolstLM/> book ''What is a Horoscope?'' as a springboard for his own ideas, as well as for the subtitles (e.g., \"The Bringer of...\") for the movements.\n\nOn 17 January 1914 Holst attended a performance of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Five Pieces for Orchestra]]'', at the Queen's Hall, conducted by Schoenberg's pupil [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoenberg.at/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1014&Itemid=726&lang=en|title=1914 \u2022 Herr Sch\u00f6nberg in London|website=www.schoenberg.at}}</ref><ref name=keller>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo4LhjGd-c4C&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=edward+clark+schoenberg&source=bl&ots=QiyjCnfRPT&sig=TxCP-0cN1hG86dsaiLr7tQLzsfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Xh8JUYfnAu2cmQWPyoG4DQ&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=edward+clark+schoenberg&f=false|title=Hans Keller and the BBC: The Musical Conscience of British Broadcasting, 1959\u201379|first=Alison|last=Garnham|date=23 October 2003|publisher=Ashgate|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVCtkShvDSkC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=Peter+Eckersley+edward+clark&source=bl&ots=G54LQFEhBQ&sig=3Hc2HGDA3blOjFRYYyTvdOH-EoM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eSsKUfW0CKaLmwX28YD4Dg&sqi=2&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=clark&f=false|title=The BBC and Ultra-Modern Music, 1922\u20131936: Shaping a Nation's Tastes|first1=Jennifer|last1=Doctor|first2=Jennifer Ruth|last2=Doctor|date=23 October 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> Holst quickly acquired a copy of the score, the only Schoenberg score he ever owned.

Holst then scored the suite for a large orchestra, in which form it became enormously popular. Holst's use of orchestration was very imaginative and colourful, showing the influence of such contemporary composers as [[Igor Stravinsky]]<ref>Short, p. 131</ref> and [[Arnold Schoenberg]],<ref name=HolstLM/> as well as such late Russian romantics as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]]. Its novel sonorities helped make the work an immediate success with audiences at home and abroad. Although ''The Planets'' remains Holst's most popular work, the composer himself did not count it among his best creations and later in life complained that its popularity had completely surpassed his other works. He was, however, partial to his own favourite movement, Saturn.<ref>Boult, Sir Adrian (1967), Liner note to EMI CD 5 66934 2</ref>\n\n==Premieres==\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote =Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: \"Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] quite soon and [[H.

Critic [[David Hurwitz (music critic)|David Hurwitz]] offers an alternative explanation for the piece's structure: that Jupiter is the centrepoint of the suite and that the movements on either side are in mirror images. Thus Mars involves motion and Neptune is static; Venus is sublime while Uranus is vulgar, and Mercury is light and ''[[scherzando]]'' while Saturn is heavy and plodding.

Holst then scored the suite for a large orchestra, in which form it became enormously popular. Holst's use of orchestration was very imaginative and colourful, showing the influence of such contemporary composers as [[Igor Stravinsky]]<ref>Short, p. 131</ref> and [[Arnold Schoenberg]],<ref name=HolstLM/> as well as such late Russian romantics as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]]. Its novel sonorities helped make the work an immediate success with audiences at home and abroad.

Critic [[David Hurwitz (music critic)|David Hurwitz]] offers an alternative explanation for the piece's structure: that Jupiter is the centrepoint of the suite and that the movements on either side are in mirror images. Thus Mars involves motion and Neptune is static; Venus is sublime while Uranus is vulgar, and Mercury is light and ''[[scherzando]]'' while Saturn is heavy and plodding. This hypothesis is lent credence by the fact that the two outer movements, Mars and Neptune, are both written in rather unusual [[quintuple meter]].\n\nHolst suffered neuritis in his right arm, which caused him to seek help from Vally Lasker and Nora Day, two [[amanuenses]], in scoring ''The Planets''.<ref name=CollFacsimEd /><ref>{{cite web |title=Gustav Holst and \u2018The Planets\u2019 |url=https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/gustav-holst-and-the-planets/ |website=The History Press |accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nNeptune was one of the first pieces of orchestral music to have a [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade-out]] ending,<ref>{{cite magazine\n|date= 14 September 2014\n|last= Weir\n|first= William\n|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2014/09/the_fade_out_in_pop_music_why_don_t_modern_pop_songs_end_by_slowly_reducing.html?wpsrc=fol_tw\n|title= A Little Bit Softer Now, a Little Bit Softer Now \u2026\n|magazine= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]\n|accessdate= 16 September 2014\n}}</ref> although several composers (including [[Joseph Haydn]] in the finale of his [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|Farewell Symphony]]) had achieved a similar effect by different means.
