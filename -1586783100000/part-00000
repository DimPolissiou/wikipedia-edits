Prior to the war, Alice Springs was an extremely isolated settlement of fewer than 500 people. During the war, however, the town was an extremely active staging base, known as No.&nbsp;9 Australian Staging Camp, and a depot base for the long four-day trip to Darwin. The railway hub in Alice Springs was taken over by military operations and the number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs grew rapidly, as did the number of personnel passing through on their way to and from Darwin. When Darwin was threatened by Japanese forces, the sea routes\u2014the Northern Territory capital's primary means of transportation and resupply\u2014were cut off. The evacuation of Darwin first brought a large number of civilians including elected officials and many of the territory government's records. Alice Springs became the war-time civilian capital of the Northern Territory. When Darwin was bombed by Japanese air forces, a large number of military personnel and their heavy equipment were rapidly moved south to Alice Springs.\n\nThe number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs peaked at around 8,000 and the number of personnel passing through totalled close to 200,000.<ref name=thewaryears>{{cite web |title=Central Australia the war years 1939\u20131945 |url=http://www.thewaryears.alicespringsrsl.com.au/townlife.shtml |work=RSL On-Line Museum |publisher=RSL Sub Branch Alice Springs |accessdate=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217185555/http://www.thewaryears.alicespringsrsl.com.au/townlife.shtml |archive-date=17 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Once the war ended, the military camps and the evacuees departed, and Alice Springs' population declined rapidly. After being visited by nearly 200,000 people, including the American General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Alice Springs gained considerable fame. The war years also left behind many structures. The historically-listed [[Totem Theatre]], created for the entertainment of this camp, still exists today. The [[Australian Army]] set up the 109th Australian General Hospital at Alice Springs. [[Alice Springs Airport|Seven Mile Aerodrome]] was constructed by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. War-related operations necessitated the first sealing of the road between Alice Springs and Larrimah, expansion and improvement of Alice Springs' water supply, and improving the rail head.

The major sources of work that recruit workers into town are the stations, mines, healthcare and law enforcement. Foreign tourists usually pass through on their way to [[Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park]], whilst Australian tourists usually come through as a part of an event such as the [[Masters Games]] and the [[Finke Desert Race]].

The Alice Springs Town Council has governed Alice Springs since 1971. The Alice Springs council consists of nine members: the mayor and eight [[aldermen]]. The town is not divided up into wards. The current mayor of Alice Springs is Damien Ryan. Council Meetings are held on the last Monday of each month.

[[Electoral division of Araluen|Araluen]] and [[Electoral division of Braitling|Braitling]] are entirely within Alice Springs, while the mostly rural seats of [[Electoral division of Stuart|Stuart]] and [[electoral division of Namatjira|Namatjira]] spill into the town. Historically, Alice Springs has tilted conservative. It was a stronghold for the [[Country Liberal Party]] for many years; only the northeast (part of which is in Stuart) leans [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]. However, these trends were dramatically altered at the [[2016 Northern Territory general election|2016 election]]. Former Chief Minister and Alice Springs resident [[Adam Giles]] lost Braitling to Labor, Araluen was retained by a former CLP member turned independent, and Namatjira and Stuart fell to Labor. As a result, the CLP was completely shut out of Alice Springs for the first time ever.\n\nIn the [[Australian House of Representatives]], Alice Springs is part of the [[Division of Lingiari]], which includes all of the Territory outside the Darwin/Palmerston area.

Many cameleers moved to Alice Springs in 1929 when the railway finally reached the town. They lived on the block where the town council is now, transporting goods from the rail head to stations and settlements to the north. A gold rush in Tennant Creek in 1932 kept the wheels of the Alice Springs economy turning until the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"flynntrail.org.au\"/>\n\nAlice Springs was connected to Darwin by rail on 4 February 2004, when [[The Ghan|the first passenger train]] arrived in Darwin from Adelaide.\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] brought significant changes to Alice Springs. Prior to the war, Alice Springs was an extremely isolated settlement of fewer than 500 people. During the war, however, the town was an extremely active staging base, known as No.&nbsp;9 Australian Staging Camp, and a depot base for the long four-day trip to Darwin. The railway hub in Alice Springs was taken over by military operations and the number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs grew rapidly, as did the number of personnel passing through on their way to and from Darwin. When Darwin was threatened by Japanese forces, the sea routes\u2014the Northern Territory capital's primary means of transportation and resupply\u2014were cut off. The evacuation of Darwin first brought a large number of civilians including elected officials and many of the territory government's records. Alice Springs became the war-time civilian capital of the Northern Territory. When Darwin was bombed by Japanese air forces, a large number of military personnel and their heavy equipment were rapidly moved south to Alice Springs.\n\nThe number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs peaked at around 8,000 and the number of personnel passing through totalled close to 200,000.<ref name=thewaryears>{{cite web |title=Central Australia the war years 1939\u20131945 |url=http://www.thewaryears.alicespringsrsl.com.au/townlife.shtml |work=RSL On-Line Museum |publisher=RSL Sub Branch Alice Springs |accessdate=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217185555/http://www.thewaryears.alicespringsrsl.com.au/townlife.shtml |archive-date=17 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Once the war ended, the military camps and the evacuees departed, and Alice Springs' population declined rapidly. After being visited by nearly 200,000 people, including the American General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Alice Springs gained considerable fame. The war years also left behind many structures. The historically-listed [[Totem Theatre]], created for the entertainment of this camp, still exists today. The [[Australian Army]] set up the 109th Australian General Hospital at Alice Springs. [[Alice Springs Airport|Seven Mile Aerodrome]] was constructed by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. War-related operations necessitated the first sealing of the road between Alice Springs and Larrimah, expansion and improvement of Alice Springs' water supply, and improving the rail head.
