Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain myosin [[protein isoform|isoforms]].  Some isoforms have specialized functions in certain cell types (such as muscle), while other isoforms are ubiquitous.  The structure and function of myosin is globally conserved across species, to the extent that rabbit muscle myosin II will bind to actin from an [[amoeba]].<ref name=\"McMahon\">McMahon, T. A. 1984.

The neck domain can also serve as a binding site for myosin ''light chains'' which are distinct proteins that form part of a macromolecular complex and generally have regulatory functions.\n* The ''tail domain'' generally mediates interaction with cargo molecules and/or other myosin [[protein subunits|subunit]]s. In some cases, the tail domain may play a role in regulating motor activity.\n\n===Power stroke===\n{{Main|Muscle contraction}}\n\nMultiple myosin II molecules generate force in [[muscle contraction|skeletal muscle]] through a power stroke mechanism fuelled by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyska MJ, Warshaw DM | title = The myosin power stroke | journal = Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201315 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11810692 | doi = 10.1002/cm.10014 }}</ref> The power stroke occurs at the release of phosphate from the myosin molecule after the ATP hydrolysis while myosin is tightly bound to actin.

The nomenclature can therefore be somewhat confusing when attempting to compare the functions of myosin proteins within and between organisms.\n\nSkeletal muscle myosin, the most conspicuous of the myosin superfamily due to its abundance in [[muscle fibers]], was the first to be discovered. This protein makes up part of the sarcomere and forms macromolecular filaments composed of multiple myosin subunits. Similar filament-forming myosin proteins were found in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and nonmuscle cells. However, beginning in the 1970s, researchers began to discover new myosin genes in simple eukaryotes<ref name=\"Pollard and Korn, 1973\"/> encoding proteins that acted as monomers and were therefore entitled Class I myosins. These new myosins were collectively termed \"unconventional myosins\"<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheney RE, Mooseker MS | title = Unconventional myosins | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 27\u201335 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1558751 | doi = 10.1016/0955-0674(92)90055-H }}</ref> and have been found in many tissues other than muscle.

Presumably this is so the myosins may interact, via their tails, with a large number of different cargoes, while the goal in each case \u2013 to move along actin filaments \u2013 remains the same and therefore requires the same machinery in the motor. For example, the [[human genome]] contains over 40 different myosin [[genes]].\n\nThese differences in shape also determine the speed at which myosins can move along actin filaments. The hydrolysis of ATP and the subsequent release of the [[phosphate]] group causes the \"power stroke,\" in which the \"lever arm\" or \"neck\" region of the heavy chain is dragged forward. Since the power stroke always moves the lever arm by the same angle, the length of the lever arm determines the displacement of the cargo relative to the actin filament.   A longer lever arm will cause the cargo to traverse a greater distance even though the lever arm undergoes the same angular displacement \u2013 just as a person with longer legs can move farther with each individual step.

Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain myosin [[protein isoform|isoforms]].  Some isoforms have specialized functions in certain cell types (such as muscle), while other isoforms are ubiquitous.

The neck domain can also serve as a binding site for myosin ''light chains'' which are distinct proteins that form part of a macromolecular complex and generally have regulatory functions.\n* The ''tail domain'' generally mediates interaction with cargo molecules and/or other myosin [[protein subunits|subunit]]s. In some cases, the tail domain may play a role in regulating motor activity.\n\n===Power stroke===\n{{Main|Muscle contraction}}\n\nMultiple myosin II molecules generate force in [[muscle contraction|skeletal muscle]] through a power stroke mechanism fuelled by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyska MJ, Warshaw DM | title = The myosin power stroke | journal = Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201315 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11810692 | doi = 10.1002/cm.10014 }}</ref> The power stroke occurs at the release of phosphate from the myosin molecule after the ATP hydrolysis while myosin is tightly bound to actin.

The nomenclature can therefore be somewhat confusing when attempting to compare the functions of myosin proteins within and between organisms.\n\nSkeletal muscle myosin, the most conspicuous of the myosin superfamily due to its abundance in [[muscle fibers]], was the first to be discovered. This protein makes up part of the sarcomere and forms macromolecular filaments composed of multiple myosin subunits. Similar filament-forming myosin proteins were found in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and nonmuscle cells. However, beginning in the 1970s, researchers began to discover new myosin genes in simple eukaryotes<ref name=\"Pollard and Korn, 1973\"/> encoding proteins that acted as monomers and were therefore entitled Class I myosins. These new myosins were collectively termed \"unconventional myosins\"<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheney RE, Mooseker MS | title = Unconventional myosins | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 27\u201335 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1558751 | doi = 10.1016/0955-0674(92)90055-H }}</ref> and have been found in many tissues other than muscle.

Presumably this is so the myosins may interact, via their tails, with a large number of different cargoes, while the goal in each case \u2013 to move along actin filaments \u2013 remains the same and therefore requires the same machinery in the motor. For example, the [[human genome]] contains over 40 different myosin [[genes]].\n\nThese differences in shape also determine the speed at which myosins can move along actin filaments. The hydrolysis of ATP and the subsequent release of the [[phosphate]] group causes the \"power stroke,\" in which the \"lever arm\" or \"neck\" region of the heavy chain is dragged forward. Since the power stroke always moves the lever arm by the same angle, the length of the lever arm determines the displacement of the cargo relative to the actin filament.   A longer lever arm will cause the cargo to traverse a greater distance even though the lever arm undergoes the same angular displacement \u2013 just as a person with longer legs can move farther with each individual step.  The velocity of a myosin motor depends upon the rate at which it passes through a complete kinetic cycle of ATP binding to the release of ADP.\n\n===Myosin classes===\n\n====Myosin I====\nMyosin I, a ubiquitous cellular protein, functions  as monomer and functions in [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] transport.<ref>{{cite web| first = Sutherland | last = Macive | name-list-format = vanc |title=Myosin I |url=http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/Myosin%20I.htm |date=June 4, 2003 |access-date=2007-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602100321/http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/Myosin%20I.htm |archive-date=June 2, 2007 }}</ref> It has a step size of 10&nbsp;nm and has been implicated as being responsible for the adaptation response of the stereocilia in the inner ear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Batters C, Arthur CP, Lin A, Porter J, Geeves MA, Milligan RA, Molloy JE, Coluccio LM | title = Myo1c is designed for the adaptation response in the inner ear | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 1433\u201340 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15014434 | pmc = 391074 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600169 }}</ref>\n\n====Myosin II====\n[[File:Sarcomere.svg|thumb|350px|[[Sliding filament model]] of muscle contraction.]]\nMyosin II (also known as conventional myosin) is the myosin type responsible for producing [[muscle contraction]] in [[muscle cell]]s in most animal cell types.

{"title_page": "Deese\u2013Roediger\u2013McDermott paradigm", "text_new": "{{primary sources|date=December 2012}}\nThe '''Deese\u2013Roediger\u2013McDermott''' ('''DRM''') '''paradigm''' is a procedure in [[cognitive psychology]] used to study [[false memory]] in humans. The procedure was pioneered by [[James Deese]] in 1959, but it was not until [[Henry L. Roediger III]] and [[Kathleen McDermott (psychologist)|Kathleen McDermott]] extended the line of research in 1995 that the paradigm became popular. The procedure typically involves the oral presentation of a list of related words (e.g., ''bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, wake, snooze, blanket, doze, slumber, snore, nap, peace, yawn, drowsy'') and then requires the subject to remember as many words from the list as possible. Typical results show that subjects recall a related but absent word (e.g., ''sleep''), known as a 'lure', with the same frequency as other presented words.<ref name= DRM>Roediger, H.L., & McDermott, K. B. (1995). Creating false memories: Remembering words not presented in lists. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 24(4), 803\u2013814. [http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/memory/1995_roediger.pdf]</ref> When asked about their experience after the test, about half of all participants report that they are sure that they remember hearing the lure, indicating a false memory \u2013 a memory for an event that never occurred.\n\nThe simplicity of the paradigm and the ease with which DRM studies can be conducted have helped the DRM paradigm become popular among human memory researchers, as well as researchers from other fields.\n\n==Background==\nThe foundations of the DRM paradigm were developed by [[James Deese]] while working at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In his 1959 article, \"On the prediction of occurrence of particular verbal intrusions in immediate recall\", Deese attempted to better understand why, when reciting a previously learned list of words, people sometimes recall a word that was never presented. He orally presented 50 undergraduate students with lists of 12 words, all strongly associated to an absent critical lure, and then immediately after each list was presented asked the students to recall all the items from the list. He found that the critical lure was recalled up to 44% of the time, but that this result varied over different lists. Although all the words in any list were associated with the critical lure, Deese found that the likelihood of false recall depended heavily on the ability of the list words to activate the critical lure \u2013 for example Deese claimed that a list containing 'short' could produce recall of the lure 'man', but a list containing 'man' could not produce recall of the lure 'short'.<ref>Deese, J. (1959). On the prediction of occurrence of particular verbal intrusions in immediate recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 58, 17\u201322.</ref>\n\nOther research into false memories had tended to rely on experiences or stories, rather than word lists. [[Frederic Bartlett]] famously pioneered this area of research with his studies on remembering using the Indian folktale 'The war of the ghosts'. His studies had British college students learn the Indian folktale and then recall it again and again over time.<ref>Bartlett, F.C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press http://www.sdp.cam.ac.uk/bartlett/RememberingBook.htm{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He found that performance decreased over time, but also found that over time the students 'remembered' the story in a manner that increasingly followed British cultural norms.<ref>Nairne, J.

(1965). False recognition produced by implicit verbal responses. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 70, 122\u2013129.</ref>\n\n==Roediger and McDermott==\nLittle attention was given to Deese's experiment until the early 1990s when [[Henry L. Roediger III]] came across the 1959 article and decided to further explore the findings. He gave the job of piloting further research to a young graduate student, who subsequently left the field of psychology without conducting any of the proposed research. Roediger eventually offered the project to his PhD student Kathleen McDermott, who completed the experiments as part of her PhD dissertation.<ref>Observer, November 2007. Rising Stars: Bright Lights in Psychological Science (Part II). http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2252</ref>\n\nFirst, Roediger and McDermott replicated Deese's research by using the six lists from Deese's study that were the most successful in producing false recall. Roediger read the lists of 12 words to a class of students, and after each list asked them to recall as many words as possible from that list. Following the recall of the sixth list the students were given a pen-and-paper recognition memory test: a list of words comprising 12 studied and 30 unstudied items (including the critical lures) on which the students rated how confident they were that each word had appeared on one of the previous lists. The results showed that students recalled the critical lure 40% of the time, and that most were confident that the critical lures had actually appeared on the lists.<ref name= DRM/>\n\nTo follow up this study, Roediger and McDermott conducted a second experiment that allowed better experimental control. This time they created extra lists similar to those used by Deese, except the new lists had 15 items instead of 12 and the design was manipulated in a few minor ways. The major difference in this second experiment was the inclusion of a '[[Remember versus know judgements|remember-know]]' judgement task. This task is applied to a recognition test in order to determine whether subjects recognise an item based on their memory, or based on familiarity. Subjects are first asked if an item is one they have seen before (old) or one that they have not (new), then for items that they have classified as 'old', subjects are asked to judge if they can mentally relive the experience of the item being presented (remember), or if they are confident that it occurred without having a memory for the event (know). Roediger and McDermott predicted that subjects were recalling an absent word because of a high sense of familiarity induced through the presented lists, and as such they would predominantly judge 'old' critical lures as being 'known' rather than 'remembered'. This prediction was not supported. The second experiment showed an increase in recall of the absent critical lures (to a level marginally significantly greater than actually presented words), which was paired with 72% of recognised critical lures being judged as 'remembered'. These results show clear evidence of subjects 'remembering' events that never occurred.<ref name= DRM/>\n\nThe robustness of the DRM effect and the simplicity of the experimental methods were welcomed in an area of research where small effects and elaborate stimuli were the norm. Furthermore, this paradigm allowed researchers to move past their reliance on recognition tests for false memories. Recall tests are better at showing false memories than recognition tests because subjects are required to access and recall the memory in full themselves, rather than being able to rely on some sense of familiarity. Roediger and McDermott were able to demonstrate a robust effect using recall tests as well as recognition tests, while employing simple word-list stimuli. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the experiments were able to show that subjects not only confidently recognised the absent word, but that they consciously remembered this lure appearing on the list, rather than relying on some feeling of familiarity to make an 'old' judgement.\n\n==Explanations==\nRoediger and McDermott are quick to point out that their results could be explained by an associative model of memory.<ref>Roediger, H. L., McDermott, K. B., & Robinson, K. J. (1998). The role of associative processes in producing false remembering. In M. A. Conway, S. Gathercole, & C. Cornoldi (Eds.), Theories of memory II (pp. 187\u2013245). Hove, Sussex: Psychological Press. [http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF's/BC_Roediger%20et%20al%20(1998).pdf pdf]</ref> That is, the presentation of associated words could [[spreading activation|spread activation]] through an associative network to the absent lure word, and thus the false recognition of words could be due to residual activation.

In a five experiment study using different examples of the DRM paradigms from previous work, researchers recorded data consistent with the dual-retrieval processes of [[free recall]]. These retrieval processes are direct access, the retrieval of detailed items or verbatim memory, and reconstruction, the retrieval of the sense of meaning or gist memory. They also used this understanding and the robust results of the DRM tests to reaffirm the notion that these gist traces are the source of all false memories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnhardt|first=Terrence M.|last2=Choi|first2=Hyun|last3=Gerkens|first3=David R.|last4=Smith|first4=Steven M.|date=2006|title=Output position and word relatedness effects in a DRM paradigm: Support for a dual-retrieval process theory of free recall and false memories|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2006.04.003|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=55|issue=2|pages=213\u2013231|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.04.003|issn=0749-596X|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother important application of the DRM paradigm is examining how the paradigm shifts from children to adults. Studies show that younger children have lower rates of false recall and recognition, likely due to a less developed semantic memory and therefore lacking the ability to make connections outside of the word lists given.<ref>Metzger, R.L.,  Warren, A.R., Shelton, J.T., Price, J., Reed, A.W., & Williams, D.

The procedure was pioneered by [[James Deese]] in 1959, but it was not until [[Henry L. Roediger III]] and [[Kathleen McDermott (psychologist)|Kathleen McDermott]] extended the line of research in 1995 that the paradigm became popular. The procedure typically involves the oral presentation of a list of related words (e.g., ''bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, wake, snooze, blanket, doze, slumber, snore, nap, peace, yawn, drowsy'') and then requires the subject to remember as many words from the list as possible. Typical results show that subjects recall a related but absent word (e.g., ''sleep''), known as a 'lure', with the same frequency as other presented words.<ref name= DRM>Roediger, H.L., & McDermott, K. B. (1995). Creating false memories: Remembering words not presented in lists. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 24(4), 803\u2013814. [http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/memory/1995_roediger.pdf]</ref> When asked about their experience after the test, about half of all participants report that they are sure that they remember hearing the lure, indicating a false memory \u2013 a memory for an event that never occurred.\n\nThe simplicity of the paradigm and the ease with which DRM studies can be conducted have helped the DRM paradigm become popular among human memory researchers, as well as researchers from other fields.\n\n==Background==\nThe foundations of the DRM paradigm were developed by [[James Deese]] while working at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In his 1959 article, \"On the prediction of occurrence of particular verbal intrusions in immediate recall\", Deese attempted to better understand why, when reciting a previously learned list of words, people sometimes recall a word that was never presented. He orally presented 50 undergraduate students with lists of 12 words, all strongly associated to an absent critical lure, and then immediately after each list was presented asked the students to recall all the items from the list. He found that the critical lure was recalled up to 44% of the time, but that this result varied over different lists. Although all the words in any list were associated with the critical lure, Deese found that the likelihood of false recall depended heavily on the ability of the list words to activate the critical lure \u2013 for example Deese claimed that a list containing 'short' could produce recall of the lure 'man', but a list containing 'man' could not produce recall of the lure 'short'.<ref>Deese, J. (1959). On the prediction of occurrence of particular verbal intrusions in immediate recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 58, 17\u201322.</ref>\n\nOther research into false memories had tended to rely on experiences or stories, rather than word lists. [[Frederic Bartlett]] famously pioneered this area of research with his studies on remembering using the Indian folktale 'The war of the ghosts'. His studies had British college students learn the Indian folktale and then recall it again and again over time.<ref>Bartlett, F.C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press http://www.sdp.cam.ac.uk/bartlett/RememberingBook.htm{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He found that performance decreased over time, but also found that over time the students 'remembered' the story in a manner that increasingly followed British cultural norms.<ref>Nairne, J.

(1965). False recognition produced by implicit verbal responses. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 70, 122\u2013129.</ref>\n\n==Roediger and McDermott==\nLittle attention was given to Deese's experiment until the early 1990s when [[Henry L. Roediger III]] came across the 1959 article and decided to further explore the findings. He gave the job of piloting further research to a young graduate student, who subsequently left the field of psychology without conducting any of the proposed research. Roediger eventually offered the project to his PhD student Kathleen McDermott, who completed the experiments as part of her PhD dissertation.<ref>Observer, November 2007. Rising Stars: Bright Lights in Psychological Science (Part II). http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2252</ref>\n\nFirst, Roediger and McDermott replicated Deese's research by using the six lists from Deese's study that were the most successful in producing false recall. Roediger read the lists of 12 words to a class of students, and after each list asked them to recall as many words as possible from that list. Following the recall of the sixth list the students were given a pen-and-paper recognition memory test: a list of words comprising 12 studied and 30 unstudied items (including the critical lures) on which the students rated how confident they were that each word had appeared on one of the previous lists. The results showed that students recalled the critical lure 40% of the time, and that most were confident that the critical lures had actually appeared on the lists.<ref name= DRM/>\n\nTo follow up this study, Roediger and McDermott conducted a second experiment that allowed better experimental control. This time they created extra lists similar to those used by Deese, except the new lists had 15 items instead of 12 and the design was manipulated in a few minor ways. The major difference in this second experiment was the inclusion of a '[[Remember versus know judgements|remember-know]]' judgement task. This task is applied to a recognition test in order to determine whether subjects recognise an item based on their memory, or based on familiarity. Subjects are first asked if an item is one they have seen before (old) or one that they have not (new), then for items that they have classified as 'old', subjects are asked to judge if they can mentally relive the experience of the item being presented (remember), or if they are confident that it occurred without having a memory for the event (know). Roediger and McDermott predicted that subjects were recalling an absent word because of a high sense of familiarity induced through the presented lists, and as such they would predominantly judge 'old' critical lures as being 'known' rather than 'remembered'. This prediction was not supported. The second experiment showed an increase in recall of the absent critical lures (to a level marginally significantly greater than actually presented words), which was paired with 72% of recognised critical lures being judged as 'remembered'. These results show clear evidence of subjects 'remembering' events that never occurred.<ref name= DRM/>\n\nThe robustness of the DRM effect and the simplicity of the experimental methods were welcomed in an area of research where small effects and elaborate stimuli were the norm. Furthermore, this paradigm allowed researchers to move past their reliance on recognition tests for false memories. Recall tests are better at showing false memories than recognition tests because subjects are required to access and recall the memory in full themselves, rather than being able to rely on some sense of familiarity. Roediger and McDermott were able to demonstrate a robust effect using recall tests as well as recognition tests, while employing simple word-list stimuli. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the experiments were able to show that subjects not only confidently recognised the absent word, but that they consciously remembered this lure appearing on the list, rather than relying on some feeling of familiarity to make an 'old' judgement.\n\n==Explanations==\nRoediger and McDermott are quick to point out that their results could be explained by an associative model of memory.<ref>Roediger, H. L., McDermott, K. B., & Robinson, K. J. (1998). The role of associative processes in producing false remembering. In M. A. Conway, S. Gathercole, & C. Cornoldi (Eds.), Theories of memory II (pp. 187\u2013245). Hove, Sussex: Psychological Press. [http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF's/BC_Roediger%20et%20al%20(1998).pdf pdf]</ref> That is, the presentation of associated words could [[spreading activation|spread activation]] through an associative network to the absent lure word, and thus the false recognition of words could be due to residual activation. This model explains the higher false recognition in the second experiment as a product of more activation being spread due to the longer word-lists used. This theory has parallels with [[prototype theory]], which claims that the presentation of patterns that match some prototype activates and increases the recognition of the prototype, even when it has never been presented.<ref>Posner, M.I., & Keele, S.W. (1968). On the genesis of abstract ideas.

They found evidence that suggests different brain processes may underlie the retrieval of real and false memories, with false-memory retrieval showing distinctly different patterns of neural activity to retrieval of real memories.<ref>Fabiani, M., Stadler, M.A., Wessels, P.M. (2000). True but not false memories produce a sensory signature in human lateralized brain potentials. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 12(6), 941\u2013949.

In a five experiment study using different examples of the DRM paradigms from previous work, researchers recorded data consistent with the dual-retrieval processes of [[free recall]]. These retrieval processes are direct access, the retrieval of detailed items or verbatim memory, and reconstruction, the retrieval of the sense of meaning or gist memory. They also used this understanding and the robust results of the DRM tests to reaffirm the notion that these gist traces are the source of all false memories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnhardt|first=Terrence M.|last2=Choi|first2=Hyun|last3=Gerkens|first3=David R.|last4=Smith|first4=Steven M.|date=2006|title=Output position and word relatedness effects in a DRM paradigm: Support for a dual-retrieval process theory of free recall and false memories|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2006.04.003|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=55|issue=2|pages=213\u2013231|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.04.003|issn=0749-596X|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother important application of the DRM paradigm is examining how the paradigm shifts from children to adults. Studies show that younger children have lower rates of false recall and recognition, likely due to a less developed semantic memory and therefore lacking the ability to make connections outside of the word lists given.<ref>Metzger, R.L.,  Warren, A.R., Shelton, J.T., Price, J., Reed, A.W., & Williams, D.

The two individuals responsible for the army were [[Kim Tu-bong]] and Mu Chong. At the same time, a school was established near Yan'an for training military and political leaders for a future independent Korea. By 1945, the KVA had grown to approximately 1,000 men, mostly Korean deserters from the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. During this period, the KVA fought alongside the Chinese communist forces from which it drew its arms and ammunition. After the defeat of the Japanese, the KVA accompanied the Chinese communist forces into eastern [[Jilin]], intending to gain recruits from ethnic [[Koreans in China]], particularly from [[Yanbian]], and then enter Korea.<ref>Elleman, Bruce.

That unit was activated on 15 August of the same year to supervise existing security forces and creation of the national armed forces.<ref name=\"Army\"/>\n\nMilitary institutes such as the Pyongyang Academy (became No. 2 KPA Officers School in Jan. 1949) and the Central Constabulary Academy (became KPA Military Academy in Dec. 1948) soon followed for the education of political and military officers for the new armed forces.\n\nAfter the military was organised and facilities to educate its new recruits were constructed, the Constabulary Discipline Corps was reorganised into the Korean People's Army General Headquarters. The previously semi-official units became military regulars with the distribution of Soviet uniforms, badges, and weapons that followed the inception of the headquarters.<ref name=\"Army\"/>\n\nThe State Security Department, a forerunner to the Ministry of People's Defense, was created as part of the Interim People's Committee on 4 February 1948. The formal creation of the Korean People's Army was announced on four days later on 8 February, the day after the Fourth Plenary Session of the People's Assembly approved the plan to separate the roles of the military and those of the police,<ref>James M. Minnich, The North Korean People's Army, p. 36</ref> seven months before the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed on 9 September 1948. In addition, the Ministry of State for the People's Armed Forces was established, which controlled a central guard battalion, two divisions, and an independent mixed and combined arms brigade.<ref name=\"Army\"/>\n\n===Conflicts and events===\n[[File:Mansudae Grand Monument 26.JPG|thumb|upright|The Memorial of Soldiers at the Mansudae Grand Monument]]\nBefore the outbreak of the Korean War, [[Joseph Stalin]] equipped the KPA with modern tanks, trucks, artillery, and small arms (at the time, the South Korean Army had nothing remotely comparable either in numbers of troops or equipment). During the opening phases of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, the KPA quickly drove South Korean forces south and captured [[Seoul]], only to lose 70,000 of their 100,000-strong army in the autumn after U.S. amphibious landings at the [[Battle of Incheon]] and a subsequent drive to the [[Yalu River]]. On 4 November, China openly staged a military intervention. On 7 December, Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.<ref>Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, MAO: The Unknown Story.</ref> The KPA subsequently played a secondary minor role to Chinese forces in the remainder of the conflict. By the time of the Armistice in 1953, the KPA had sustained 290,000 casualties and lost 90,000 men as POWs.\n\t\nIn 1953, the [[Military Armistice Commission]] (MAC) was able to oversee and enforce the terms of the armistice. The [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]] (NNSC), made up of delegations from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], Sweden and [[Switzerland]], carried out inspections to ensure implementation of the terms of the Armistice that prevented reinforcements or new weapons being brought into Korea.\n\t\nSoviet thinking on the strategic scale was replaced since December 1962 with a [[people's war]] concept. The Soviet idea of direct warfare was replaced with a Maoist [[war of attrition]] strategy. Along with the mechanisation of some infantry units, more emphasis was put on light weapons, high-angle indirect fire, night fighting, and sea denial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0146)|title=The Evolution of North Korean Military Thought|work=North Korea Country Study|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|year=1993}}</ref>\n\n== Date of establishment history ==\nUntil 1977, original Korean People's Army's official [[date of establishment]] was 8 February 1948.

What little is known indicates that many changes were the natural result of the deaths of the ageing leadership including [[Kim Il-sung]] (July 1994), Minister of People's Armed Forces [[O Chin-u]] (February 1995) and Minister of People's Armed Forces [[Choi Kwang]] (February 1997).\n\nThe vast majority of changes were undertaken to secure the power and position of [[Kim Jong-il]]. Formerly the State Affairs Commission, from its founding in 1972 (originally the [[National Defence Commission]]), was part of the Central People's Committee (CPC) while the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, from 1982 onward, was under direct presidential control. At the Eighteenth session of the sixth Central People's Committee, held on 23 May 1990, the SAC became established as its own independent commission, rising to the same status as the CPC (now the [[Cabinet of North Korea]]) and not subordinated to it, as was the case before. Concurrent with this, [[Kim Jong-il]] was appointed first vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission. The following year, on 24 December 1991, Kim Jong-il was appointed [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]]. Four months later, on 20 April 1992, Kim Jong-il was awarded the rank of Marshal and his father, in virtue of being the KPA's founding commander in chief, became Grand Marshal as a result and one year later he became the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, by now under Supreme People's Assembly control under the then 1992 constitution as amended.\n\nAlmost all officers of the KPA began their military careers as privates; only very few people are admitted to a military academy without prior service. The results is an egalitarian military system where officers are familiar with the life of a military private and \"military nobility\" is all but nonexistent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The good things in North Korea |first=Fyodor |last=Tertitskiy |work=NK News |date=6 June 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/06/the-good-things-in-north-korea/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617153436/https://www.nknews.org/2016/06/the-good-things-in-north-korea/ |archivedate=17 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the KPA, between December 1991 and December 1995, nearly 800 high officers (out of approximately 1,200) received promotions and preferential assignments. Three days after Kim Jong-il became Marshal, eight generals were appointed to the rank of Vice-Marshal. In April 1997, on the 85th anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung's birthday]], Kim Jong-il promoted 127 general and admiral grade officers. The following April he ordered the promotions of another 22 generals and flag officers. Along with these changes, many KPA officers were appointed to influential positions within the Korean Workers' Party. These promotions continue today, simultaneous with the celebration of Kim Il-sung's birthday and the KPA anniversary celebrations every April and since recently in July to honour the end of the Korean War. Under Kim Jong-il's leadership, political officers dispatched from the party monitored every move of a general's daily life, according to analysts<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> similar to the work of Soviet [[political commissar]]s during the early and middle years of the military establishment.\n\nToday the KPA exercises full control of both the Politburo and the Central Military Commission of the WPK, the KPA General Political and General Staff Departments and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, all having KPA representatives with a minimum general officer rank. Following changes made during the 4th session of the 13th Supreme People's Assembly on 29 June 2016, the State Affairs Commission has overseen the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces as part of its systemic responsibilities. All members of the State Affairs Commission have membership status (regular or alternate) on the WPK Political Bureau.\n\n===Ground forces formations===\n*[[I Corps (North Korea)|I Corps]] ([[Hoeyang County]], [[Kangowon Province]])\n*[[II Corps (North Korea)|II Corps]] ([[Pyongsan County]], [[North Hwanghae Province]])\n*[[III Corps (North Korea)|III Corps]] ([[Nampo]], [[South Pyongan]])\n*[[IV Corps (North Korea)|IV Corps]] ([[Haeju]], [[South Hwanghae Province]])\n*[[V Corps (North Korea)|V Corps]] ([[Sepo County]], [[Kangwon Province (North Korea)|Kangwon Province]])\n*[[VII Corps (North Korea)|VII Corps]] ([[Hamhung]], [[South Hamgyong Province]])\n*[[Pyongyang Defense Command]]\n*[[XII Corps (North Korea)|XII Corps]]\n*[[IX Corps (North Korea)|IX]]  ([[Chongjin]], [[North Hamgyong Province]])\n*[[X Corps (North Korea)|X Corps]] ([[Hyesan]], [[Ryanggang Province]])\n*[[XI Corps (North Korea)|XI Corps]] ([[Tokchon]], [[South Pyongan Province]])\n*Mechanised infantry divisions:\n**[[108th Division (North Korea)|108th Division]]\n**[[425th Division (North Korea)|425th Division]]\n**[[806th Division (North Korea|806th Division]]\n**[[815th Division (North Korea)|815th Division]]\n*[[820th Tank Corps (North Korea)|820th Tank Corps]]\n  \n===Conscription and terms of service===\n[[File:Korean People's Army Soldiers prepare to repatriate remains during a repatriation ceremony at the Panmunjom Joint Security Area on 981106-F-AF179-013.jpg|thumb|North Korean soldiers at Panmunjom]]\n{{Further|Conscription in North Korea}}\n[[Conscription in North Korea|North Korea has universal conscription]] for males and selective conscription for females with many pre- and post-service requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Article 86 of the [[Constitution of North Korea|North Korean Constitution]] states: \"National defence is the supreme duty and honour of citizens.\nCitizens shall defend the country and serve in the armed forces as\nrequired by law.\"<ref>{{cite book|postscript=&nbsp;Amended and supplemented on 1 April, Juche 102 (2013), at the Seventh Session of the Twelfth Supreme People's Assembly. |chapter=Chapter V, Article 86 |title=Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047#.pdf |year=2014 |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Pyongyang |isbn=978-9946-0-1099-1 |page=18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608030306/http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047 |archivedate=8 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nKPA soldiers serve three years of military service in the KPA, which also runs its own factories, farms and trading arms.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/world/asia/kim-jong-un-hailed-as-supreme-commander-of-north-koreas-military.html |title=Kim Jong-un Hailed as Supreme Commander of North Korea's Military |first=Choe |last=Sang-hun |date=24 December 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |work=The New York Times |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220060517/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/world/asia/kim-jong-un-hailed-as-supreme-commander-of-north-koreas-military.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Paramilitary organisations====\nThe Young Red Guards are the youth cadet corps of the KPA for secondary level and university level students.

The two individuals responsible for the army were [[Kim Tu-bong]] and Mu Chong. At the same time, a school was established near Yan'an for training military and political leaders for a future independent Korea. By 1945, the KVA had grown to approximately 1,000 men, mostly Korean deserters from the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. During this period, the KVA fought alongside the Chinese communist forces from which it drew its arms and ammunition. After the defeat of the Japanese, the KVA accompanied the Chinese communist forces into eastern [[Jilin]], intending to gain recruits from ethnic [[Koreans in China]], particularly from [[Yanbian]], and then enter Korea.<ref>Elleman, Bruce.

Two thousand Koreans with previous experience in the Soviet army were sent to various locations around the country to organise [[constabulary]] forces with permission from Soviet military headquarters, and the force was created on 21 October 1945.<ref name=\"Army\">{{US Army|author=Scobell, Andrew; Sanford John M|article=North Korea's Military Threat: Pyongyang's Conventional Forces, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and Ballistic Missiles|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216085335/http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub771.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2014}} April 2007.

That unit was activated on 15 August of the same year to supervise existing security forces and creation of the national armed forces.<ref name=\"Army\"/>\n\nMilitary institutes such as the Pyongyang Academy (became No. 2 KPA Officers School in Jan. 1949) and the Central Constabulary Academy (became KPA Military Academy in Dec. 1948) soon followed for the education of political and military officers for the new armed forces.\n\nAfter the military was organised and facilities to educate its new recruits were constructed, the Constabulary Discipline Corps was reorganised into the Korean People's Army General Headquarters. The previously semi-official units became military regulars with the distribution of Soviet uniforms, badges, and weapons that followed the inception of the headquarters.<ref name=\"Army\"/>\n\nThe State Security Department, a forerunner to the Ministry of People's Defense, was created as part of the Interim People's Committee on 4 February 1948. The formal creation of the Korean People's Army was announced on four days later on 8 February, the day after the Fourth Plenary Session of the People's Assembly approved the plan to separate the roles of the military and those of the police,<ref>James M. Minnich, The North Korean People's Army, p. 36</ref> seven months before the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed on 9 September 1948. In addition, the Ministry of State for the People's Armed Forces was established, which controlled a central guard battalion, two divisions, and an independent mixed and combined arms brigade.<ref name=\"Army\"/>\n\n===Conflicts and events===\n[[File:Mansudae Grand Monument 26.JPG|thumb|upright|The Memorial of Soldiers at the Mansudae Grand Monument]]\nBefore the outbreak of the Korean War, [[Joseph Stalin]] equipped the KPA with modern tanks, trucks, artillery, and small arms (at the time, the South Korean Army had nothing remotely comparable either in numbers of troops or equipment). During the opening phases of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, the KPA quickly drove South Korean forces south and captured [[Seoul]], only to lose 70,000 of their 100,000-strong army in the autumn after U.S. amphibious landings at the [[Battle of Incheon]] and a subsequent drive to the [[Yalu River]]. On 4 November, China openly staged a military intervention. On 7 December, Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.<ref>Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, MAO: The Unknown Story.</ref> The KPA subsequently played a secondary minor role to Chinese forces in the remainder of the conflict. By the time of the Armistice in 1953, the KPA had sustained 290,000 casualties and lost 90,000 men as POWs.\n\t\nIn 1953, the [[Military Armistice Commission]] (MAC) was able to oversee and enforce the terms of the armistice. The [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]] (NNSC), made up of delegations from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], Sweden and [[Switzerland]], carried out inspections to ensure implementation of the terms of the Armistice that prevented reinforcements or new weapons being brought into Korea.\n\t\nSoviet thinking on the strategic scale was replaced since December 1962 with a [[people's war]] concept. The Soviet idea of direct warfare was replaced with a Maoist [[war of attrition]] strategy. Along with the mechanisation of some infantry units, more emphasis was put on light weapons, high-angle indirect fire, night fighting, and sea denial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0146)|title=The Evolution of North Korean Military Thought|work=North Korea Country Study|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|year=1993}}</ref>\n\n== Date of establishment history ==\nUntil 1977, original Korean People's Army's official [[date of establishment]] was 8 February 1948.

A secondary path, to ensure political control of the military establishment, extends through the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]'s [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea]].\n\nSince 1990, numerous and dramatic transformations within the {{abbr|DPRK|Democratic People's Republic of Korea}} have led to the current command and control structure. The details of the majority of these changes are simply unknown to the world. What little is known indicates that many changes were the natural result of the deaths of the ageing leadership including [[Kim Il-sung]] (July 1994), Minister of People's Armed Forces [[O Chin-u]] (February 1995) and Minister of People's Armed Forces [[Choi Kwang]] (February 1997).\n\nThe vast majority of changes were undertaken to secure the power and position of [[Kim Jong-il]]. Formerly the State Affairs Commission, from its founding in 1972 (originally the [[National Defence Commission]]), was part of the Central People's Committee (CPC) while the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, from 1982 onward, was under direct presidential control. At the Eighteenth session of the sixth Central People's Committee, held on 23 May 1990, the SAC became established as its own independent commission, rising to the same status as the CPC (now the [[Cabinet of North Korea]]) and not subordinated to it, as was the case before. Concurrent with this, [[Kim Jong-il]] was appointed first vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission. The following year, on 24 December 1991, Kim Jong-il was appointed [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]]. Four months later, on 20 April 1992, Kim Jong-il was awarded the rank of Marshal and his father, in virtue of being the KPA's founding commander in chief, became Grand Marshal as a result and one year later he became the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, by now under Supreme People's Assembly control under the then 1992 constitution as amended.\n\nAlmost all officers of the KPA began their military careers as privates; only very few people are admitted to a military academy without prior service. The results is an egalitarian military system where officers are familiar with the life of a military private and \"military nobility\" is all but nonexistent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The good things in North Korea |first=Fyodor |last=Tertitskiy |work=NK News |date=6 June 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/06/the-good-things-in-north-korea/ |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617153436/https://www.nknews.org/2016/06/the-good-things-in-north-korea/ |archivedate=17 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the KPA, between December 1991 and December 1995, nearly 800 high officers (out of approximately 1,200) received promotions and preferential assignments. Three days after Kim Jong-il became Marshal, eight generals were appointed to the rank of Vice-Marshal. In April 1997, on the 85th anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung's birthday]], Kim Jong-il promoted 127 general and admiral grade officers. The following April he ordered the promotions of another 22 generals and flag officers. Along with these changes, many KPA officers were appointed to influential positions within the Korean Workers' Party. These promotions continue today, simultaneous with the celebration of Kim Il-sung's birthday and the KPA anniversary celebrations every April and since recently in July to honour the end of the Korean War. Under Kim Jong-il's leadership, political officers dispatched from the party monitored every move of a general's daily life, according to analysts<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> similar to the work of Soviet [[political commissar]]s during the early and middle years of the military establishment.\n\nToday the KPA exercises full control of both the Politburo and the Central Military Commission of the WPK, the KPA General Political and General Staff Departments and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, all having KPA representatives with a minimum general officer rank. Following changes made during the 4th session of the 13th Supreme People's Assembly on 29 June 2016, the State Affairs Commission has overseen the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces as part of its systemic responsibilities. All members of the State Affairs Commission have membership status (regular or alternate) on the WPK Political Bureau.\n\n===Ground forces formations===\n*[[I Corps (North Korea)|I Corps]]\n*[[II Corps (North Korea)|II Corps]]\n*[[III Corps (North Korea)|III Corps]]\n*[[IV Corps (North Korea)|IV Corps]]\n*[[V Corps (North Korea)|V Corps]]\n*[[VII Corps (North Korea)|VII Corps]]\n*[[Pyongyang Defense Command]]\n*[[XII Corps (North Korea)|XII Corps]]\n*[[IX Corps (North Korea)|IX]]\n*[[X Corps (North Korea)|X Corps]]\n*Mechanised infantry divisions:\n**[[108th Division (North Korea)|108th Division]]\n**[[425th Division (North Korea)|425th Division]]\n**[[806th Division (North Korea|806th Division]]\n**[[815th Division (North Korea)|815th Division]]\n*[[820th Tank Corps (North Korea)|820th Tank Corps]]\n  \n===Conscription and terms of service===\n[[File:Korean People's Army Soldiers prepare to repatriate remains during a repatriation ceremony at the Panmunjom Joint Security Area on 981106-F-AF179-013.jpg|thumb|North Korean soldiers at Panmunjom]]\n{{Further|Conscription in North Korea}}\n[[Conscription in North Korea|North Korea has universal conscription]] for males and selective conscription for females with many pre- and post-service requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Article 86 of the [[Constitution of North Korea|North Korean Constitution]] states: \"National defence is the supreme duty and honour of citizens.\nCitizens shall defend the country and serve in the armed forces as\nrequired by law.\"<ref>{{cite book|postscript=&nbsp;Amended and supplemented on 1 April, Juche 102 (2013), at the Seventh Session of the Twelfth Supreme People's Assembly. |chapter=Chapter V, Article 86 |title=Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047#.pdf |year=2014 |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Pyongyang |isbn=978-9946-0-1099-1 |page=18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608030306/http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047 |archivedate=8 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nKPA soldiers serve three years of military service in the KPA, which also runs its own factories, farms and trading arms.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/world/asia/kim-jong-un-hailed-as-supreme-commander-of-north-koreas-military.html |title=Kim Jong-un Hailed as Supreme Commander of North Korea's Military |first=Choe |last=Sang-hun |date=24 December 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |work=The New York Times |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220060517/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/world/asia/kim-jong-un-hailed-as-supreme-commander-of-north-koreas-military.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Paramilitary organisations====\nThe Young Red Guards are the youth cadet corps of the KPA for secondary level and university level students.

The show followed a total of [[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)#Housemates|fourteen]] [[celebrity]] contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom built House. Each week, one or more of the housemates were eliminated from the competition by public vote and left the House. The last remaining housemate, [[Shilpa Shetty]], was declared the winner and she received \u00a3100000.\n\nThe series launched on [[Channel 4]] on 3 January 2007 and ended on 28 January 2007. [[Davina McCall]] returned as presenter, having presented both the [[Big Brother (UK)|regular]] edition and the celebrity edition of ''Big Brother'' since they first began. Eleven housemates entered on launch night, with an additional three being introduced two days later. The series was watched by an average of 4.6 million viewers, the third highest viewed series of the show to date. As with the previous [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|regular series]], it was broadcast in [[16:9]] aspect ratio, as opposed to [[4:3]] \u2013 the first series of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' to do so.\n\nThe series saw the return of [[Jade Goody]], who had become a media celebrity after appearing on the [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|third regular series]] of ''Big Brother'' in 2002, arriving with her boyfriend and her mother \u2013 marking the first time in any series of ''Big Brother UK'' where family members entered together. During its original broadcast, ''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' had become the subject of an internationally publicised [[Celebrity Big Brother racism controversy|racism controversy]]. It attracted the largest number of complaints to the UK media regulator [[Ofcom]] about a ''Big Brother'' series and, as of 2018, the second highest number of complaints about any British television broadcast of all time (after ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]''). Viewer complaints and press attention concerned housemate [[Shilpa Shetty]], and alleged that she was the subject of [[racism|racist]] [[bullying]] from some of her fellow housemates, in particular Jade Goody, [[Danielle Lloyd]] and [[Jo O'Meara]]. As a result, a protest took place in [[India]]; tensions increased between the UK and Indian governments; and a [[diplomatic incident]] occurred. Following the broadcast of the series, Ofcom concluded that ''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' had breached the [[Broadcasting Code]], and statutory sanctions were placed on Channel 4.\n\n==Production==\n===Eye logo===\nThe eye logo for this series was the same yellow and black spiraled eye used for [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]. Two modifications were a black background, therefore camouflaging the black spiral in the eye, and making only the yellow spiral visible. A star also replaced the pupil to correspond with the celebrity series. The star also shone with a yellow glow.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe [[Carphone Warehouse]] remained as sponsor of the series, however due to highly publicised controversy which surrounded the series, Carphone Warehouse subsequently ended their long running association with Big Brother.\n\n===Broadcasts===\n[[Davina McCall]] presented the main Channel 4 show, including the live launch, evictions, finale and any other live show where a twist would take place. [[Marcus Bentley]] narrated the nightly highlight shows.\n\n[[Dermot O'Leary]] presented ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother|Celebrity Big Brother's Little Brother]]'' in a teatime slot weekdays and on Sunday lunchtime. He also presented ''[[Big Brother's Big Brain|Celebrity Big Brother's Big Brain]]'', which was introduced during [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|the previous non-celebrity series]], it would not return for any subsequent series.\n\nOn [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], live coverage from the house once again dominated its daily and nightly schedule, [[E4 Music]] was once again rested during the series. [[Diary Room Uncut]] returned on Monday evenings and on Saturday night, straight after the Channel 4 show.\n\n[[Russell Brand]] presented ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth|Celebrity Big Brother's Big Mouth]]'', which was broadcast Sunday to Friday straight after the Channel 4 show. Although no announcement was made during the series, Brand announced his departure on 4 April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6526833.stm|title=Entertainment \u2013 Brand quits Big Brother spin-off|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nLive streaming also returned on the Official Channel 4 website and also on [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] at selected times.<ref>\"[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb7_celebrity/bbbb/index.jsp Celebrity Big Brother's Big Brain]\", ''Channel 4's official Big Brother site''.

The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the [[topiary]] man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House there was also a fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates.<ref name=\"Questions,Questions\">{{cite url|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb7_celebrity/news/newsstory.jsp?id=1428|title=Questions, Questions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023015716/http://channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb7_celebrity/news/newsstory.jsp?id=1428&articleMask=1&housemateId=|date=2007-01-27|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|archive-date=23 October 2007|accessdate=2018-04-08|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.\n\n===House Next Door===\nThe House Next Door was used again, and its interior was re-designed to resemble a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style kitchen, with uncomfortable beds in the bedroom, for use in the master-and-servant task.\n\n==Housemates==\nEleven housemates entered the House on Day 1, followed by three more housemates on Day 3.

It was revealed that the masters are automatically nominated for eviction in which the viewers are to vote which housemates to save, rather than evicted. Therefore, the housemate with the fewest votes is evicted. Donny, who was originally a servant, left the house on Day 3. On Day 5, Ken voluntarily left after being involved in arguments with housemates. The eviction was not cancelled, and Ken's number was removed from the voting system.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: Carole and Cleo were banned from nominating as a punishment for discussing nominations earlier.

The show followed a total of [[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)#Housemates|fourteen]] [[celebrity]] contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom built House. Each week, one or more of the housemates were eliminated from the competition by public vote and left the House. The last remaining housemate, [[Shilpa Shetty]], was declared the winner and she received \u00a3100000.\n\nThe series launched on [[Channel 4]] on 3 January 2007 and ended on 28 January 2007. [[Davina McCall]] returned as presenter, having presented both the [[Big Brother (UK)|regular]] edition and the celebrity edition of ''Big Brother'' since they first began. Eleven housemates entered on launch night, with an additional three being introduced two days later. The series was watched by an average of 4.6 million viewers, the third highest viewed series of the show to date. As with the previous [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|regular series]], it was broadcast in [[16:9]] aspect ratio, as opposed to [[4:3]] \u2013 the first series of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' to do so.\n\nThe series saw the return of [[Jade Goody]], who had become a media celebrity after appearing on the [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|third regular series]] of ''Big Brother'' in 2002, arriving with her boyfriend and her mother \u2013 marking the first time in any series of ''Big Brother UK'' where family members entered together. During its original broadcast, ''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' had become the subject of an internationally publicised [[Celebrity Big Brother racism controversy|racism controversy]]. It attracted the largest number of complaints to the UK media regulator [[Ofcom]] about a ''Big Brother'' series and, as of 2018, the second highest number of complaints about any British television broadcast of all time (after ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]''). Viewer complaints and press attention concerned housemate [[Shilpa Shetty]], and alleged that she was the subject of [[racism|racist]] [[bullying]] from some of her fellow housemates, in particular Jade Goody, [[Danielle Lloyd]] and [[Jo O'Meara]]. As a result, a protest took place in [[India]]; tensions increased between the UK and Indian governments; and a [[diplomatic incident]] occurred. Following the broadcast of the series, Ofcom concluded that ''Celebrity Big Brother 5'' had breached the [[Broadcasting Code]], and statutory sanctions were placed on Channel 4.\n\n==Production==\n===Eye logo===\nThe eye logo for this series was the same yellow and black spiraled eye used for [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]. Two modifications were a black background, therefore camouflaging the black spiral in the eye, and making only the yellow spiral visible. A star also replaced the pupil to correspond with the celebrity series. The star also shone with a yellow glow.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe [[Carphone Warehouse]] remained as sponsor of the series, however due to highly publicised controversy which surrounded the series, Carphone Warehouse subsequently ended their long running association with Big Brother.\n\n===Broadcasts===\n[[Davina McCall]] presented the main Channel 4 show, including the live launch, evictions, finale and any other live show where a twist would take place. [[Marcus Bentley]] narrated the nightly highlight shows.\n\n[[Dermot O'Leary]] presented ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother|Celebrity Big Brother's Little Brother]]'' in a teatime slot weekdays and on Sunday lunchtime. He also presented ''[[Big Brother's Big Brain|Celebrity Big Brother's Big Brain]]'', which was introduced during [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|the previous non-celebrity series]], it would not return for any subsequent series.\n\nOn [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], live coverage from the house once again dominated its daily and nightly schedule, [[E4 Music]] was once again rested during the series. [[Diary Room Uncut]] returned on Monday evenings and on Saturday night, straight after the Channel 4 show.\n\n[[Russell Brand]] presented ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth|Celebrity Big Brother's Big Mouth]]'', which was broadcast Sunday to Friday straight after the Channel 4 show.

The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the [[topiary]] man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area.

A train collided with a bridge which had been accidentally demolished by a lorry.\n\n==The lead up==\nAt approximately 06:30 UTC a tipper lorry delivering quarry stone (ballast for track formation) had delivered its load adjacent to the tracks along a railway access road but had not lowered its rear tipping body. This came into contact with the wrought iron pedestrian bridge which crosses the railway, knocking it off its pillars and onto the tracks, by High Street in Barrow on Soar village centre. This blocked all four lines. The Network Rail employee who had been supervising the delivery made an emergency call to the signaller at Leicester power signal box and asked for all train movements to be stopped in the area.

The train took some 50 yards to stop. All other trains avoided the incident stopping when receiving the call. Six train passengers were hurt, none seriously. The driver suffered worse injuries, having to be cut free and suffering two broken legs. One resident described two huge bangs; the first of the lorry hitting the bridge, the second the train hitting it minutes later.\n\n==Reaction==\nEmergency services were quick to the scene.

His real name is Abdurrahman Lermi. Apolas is a nickname his friends gave to him and has been used for his stage name.\nLermi has migrated to [[\u0130stanbul]] with his family at age of 10. After a long musician time, he decided to publish an album related with Black Sea culture.\n\nApolas Lermi, who generally performs Turkish folk songs, published his first album named ''Kalandar''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySphki4lD68&list=PL630-q6V5tZDqg2kjKVl53Z1vR-WKW51C ''Apolas Lermi Kalandar'']</ref> in 2011, which had [[Pontic Greek]] songs that have been almost forgotten in Black Sea region. Kalandar means the first month of the new year in traditional calendar. Also it means the general entertainments made on 13th-14 January. Featured songs of this album: ''Mektup, A\u011fapo Se, Ya\u011fmur, Se\u00e7im Zaman\u0131, A\u011fasar Horonu''.\n\nThe video clip of A\u011fapo Se was filmed at [[Sumela Monastery]]. This clip is also the first one made in Romeika and filmed in Sumela Monastery. ''Se\u00e7im Zaman\u0131'' song from this album has become a project called ''Diren Karadeniz'' with participation of 24 singers. This project mentions about social, political and cultural problems in Black Sea region of Turkey.\n\nLermi, has prepared a TV program called ''Kalandar'' in 2012 and pointed out traditional Black Sea music. The songs of Lermi, who performs traditional songs he has learned from bards of Black Sea, have been used in many TV series and movies.\n\n''Santa''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOFWko3AYBY&list=PL630-q6V5tZBgpk0nI2Mgz0yMrM0L-uC4 ''Apolas Lermi Santa'']</ref>  is Apolas Lermi's second solo album published in 2014. [[Santa]] is also a village in [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane]], now called [[Dumanl\u0131]].\n\nLermi has joined army after this album. When he returned, he filmed some of his songs. Featured songs of this album: ''Eski Yar, Felek, Be\u015fikd\u00fcz\u00fc, Karadeniz, Tonton, Yaban Eller, Kaderim B\u00f6yle \u0130mi\u015f, G\u00f6rele Horonu''.\n\nApolas Lermi published an archive album called ''Romeika''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxLSyWBuV54&list=PL630-q6V5tZBoP1gtbZyP1vouwsdzmTn9 ''Apolas Lermi Romeika'']</ref>  in 2016, which is full of Pontic Greek songs and is for breaking down prejudices in Turkey. This album has been published simultaneously in Greece and Turkey.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket.

Roosevelt series}}\n\nThe '''first and second terms of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt''' began on March 4, 1933, when he was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|32nd]] [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]], and ended with [[Third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's third inauguration]] on January 20, 1941. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], took office after defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Herbert Hoover]], who had presided over the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Upon his accession to office, Roosevelt led the implementation of the [[New Deal]], a series of programs designed to provide relief, recovery, and reform to Americans and the American economy.\n\nDuring his [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|first hundred days]] in office, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented major legislation and issued a profusion of [[executive order]]s. The [[Emergency Banking Act]] helped put an end to a run on banks, while the [[1933 Banking Act]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] provided major reforms in the financial sector. To provide relief to unemployed workers, Roosevelt presided over the establishment of several agencies, including the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], the [[Public Works Administration]], and the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]]. The Roosevelt administration established the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act|Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] to implement new policies designed to prevent agricultural overproduction. It also established several agencies, most notably the [[National Recovery Administration]], to reform the industrial sector, though the National Recovery Administration was struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter his party's success in the 1934 mid-term elections, Roosevelt presided over the establishment of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), another major work relief agency. He also won passage of the [[Social Security Act]], which created a national old-age pension program known as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. The same act also established a national [[unemployment insurance]] program, as well as the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Dependent Children]], which provided aid to families headed by single mothers. A third major piece of legislation, the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]], guaranteed workers the right of [[collective bargaining]] and established the [[National Labor Relations Board]]. After winning re-election in 1936, Roosevelt sought to [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], but his proposal was defeated in Congress. Roosevelt experienced less success in passing domestic legislation in his second term, as the bipartisan [[Conservative Coalition]] blocked most of his legislative proposals, aside from the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]. Nonetheless, Roosevelt built a \"[[New Deal Coalition]]\" of labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African Americans, and rural white Southerners, that would significantly realign American politics for the next several decades in the [[Fifth Party System]] and also define [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]].\n\nThe 1930s were a high point of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]] in the United States. The key foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], in which the U.S. took a non-interventionist stance in [[Latin America]]n affairs. Foreign policy issues came to the fore in the late 1930s, as [[Nazi Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] took aggressive actions against other countries. In response to fears that the United States would be drawn into foreign conflicts, Congress passed the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]], a series of laws that prevented trade with belligerents. After Japan [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invaded China]] and Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded]] [[Poland]], Roosevelt provided aid to [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[French Third Republic|France]], but the Neutrality Acts prevented the United States from becoming closely involved. After the [[Fall of France]] in June 1940, Roosevelt increased aid to the British and began to build up American military power. In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]], Roosevelt defeated Republican [[Wendell Willkie]], an internationalist who largely refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's foreign policy. He would go on to serve a [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, third and fourth terms|third term and part of a fourth term]].\n\n==Election of 1932==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1932}}\n\nWith the economy ailing after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], many Democrats hoped that the 1932 elections would see the election of the first Democratic president since [[Woodrow Wilson]], who left office in 1921. Roosevelt's [[New York state election, 1930|1930 gubernatorial re-election victory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination. With the help of allies such as [[Louis Howe]], [[James Farley]], and [[Edward M. House]], Roosevelt rallied the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] supporters of the Wilson while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the [[Southern United States|South]] and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives such as [[Al Smith]], the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee. Smith hoped to deny Roosevelt the two-thirds support necessary to win the party's presidential nomination [[1932 Democratic National Convention]], and then emerge as the nominee after multiple rounds of balloting. Roosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1932|1932 Democratic primaries]], but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Speaker of the House [[John Nance Garner]], who controlled the votes of Texas and California, threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot. With little input from Roosevelt, Garner won the vice presidential nomination. Roosevelt flew in from New York after learning that he had won the nomination, becoming the first major party presidential nominee to accept the nomination in person.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 232\u2013236, 246\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1932.svg|right|thumb|275px|1932 electoral vote results]]\n\nIn the general election, Roosevelt faced incumbent Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]]. Engaging in a cross-country campaign, Roosevelt promised to increase the federal government's [[Economic interventionism|role in the economy]] and to lower the [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] as part of a \"[[New Deal]].\" Hoover argued that the economic collapse had chiefly been the product of international disturbances, and he accused Roosevelt of promoting [[class conflict]] with his novel economic policies. Already unpopular due to the bad economy, Hoover's re-election hopes were further hampered by the [[Bonus Army|Bonus March 1932]], which ended with the violent dispersal of thousands of protesting [[veteran]]s. Roosevelt won 472 of the 531 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] and 57.4% of the popular vote, making him the first Democratic presidential nominee since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to win a [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|majority of the popular vote]]. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1932|congressional elections]], the Democrats took control of the Senate and built upon their majority in the House.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 255\u2013265}} Though congressional Democratic leadership was dominated by conservative Southerners, over half of the members of the incoming [[73rd United States Congress|73rd Congress]] had been elected since 1930. Many of these new members were eager to take action to combat the Depression, even if it meant defying the political orthodoxy of the previous years.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=right\n|Name=Roosevelt\n|President=Franklin D.

Analyzing the president's administrative style, historian [[James MacGregor Burns]] concludes:\n:The president stayed in charge of his administration...by drawing fully on his formal and informal powers as Chief Executive; by raising goals, creating momentum, inspiring a personal loyalty, getting the best out of people...by deliberately fostering among his aides a sense of competition and a clash of wills that led to disarray, heartbreak, and anger but also set off pulses of executive energy and sparks of creativity...by handing out one job to several men and several jobs to one man, thus strengthening his own position as a court of appeals, as a depository of information, and as a tool of co-ordination; by ignoring or bypassing collective decision-making agencies, such as the Cabinet...and always by persuading, flattering, juggling, improvising, reshuffling, harmonizing, conciliating, manipulating.<ref>{{cite book|last=James MacGregor Burns|title=The Soldier of Freedom: Roosevelt|year=1970|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|pages=347\u201348}}</ref>\n\nFor his first Secretary of State, Roosevelt selected [[Cordell Hull]], a prominent Tennessean who had served in the House and Senate. Though Hull had not distinguished himself as a foreign policy expert, he was a long-time advocate of tariff reduction, was respected by his Senate colleagues, and did not hold ambitions for the presidency. Roosevelt's inaugural cabinet included several influential Republicans, including Secretary of the Treasury [[William H. Woodin]], a well-connected industrialist who was personally close to Roosevelt, Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]], a progressive Republican who would play an important role in the New Deal, and Secretary of Agriculture [[Henry A. Wallace]], who had advised the Roosevelt campaign on farm policies. Roosevelt also appointed the first female cabinet member, Secretary of Labor [[Frances C. Perkins]]. Farley became Postmaster General, while Howe became Roosevelt's personal secretary until his death in 1936.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 290\u2013295}} The selections of Hull, Woodin, and Secretary of Commerce [[Daniel C.

True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money.

Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal. Reform meant long-term fixes of what was wrong, especially with the financial and banking systems. Through Roosevelt's series of radio talks, known as [[fireside chats]], he presented his proposals directly to the American public.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 157, 167-68}} To propose programs, Roosevelt relied on leading senators such as [[George W. Norris|George Norris]], [[Robert F. Wagner]], and Hugo Black, as well as his [[Brain Trust]] of academic advisers. Like Hoover, he saw the Depression caused in part by people no longer spending or investing because they were afraid.<ref>Roger Biles, ''A New Deal for the American people'' (1991) pp 33-56.</ref>\n\n====Banking reform====\n{{listen |pos=right |filename=FDR speech.ogg |title=Nothing to Fear |description=Sample of the ''Inaugural speech'' from FDR |format=[[ogg]]}}\n\nBanking reform was perhaps the single most urgent task facing the newly inaugurated administration. Thousands of banks had failed or were on the verge of failing, and panicked depositors [[Bank run|sought to remove their savings]] from banks for fear that they would lose their deposits after a bank failure. In the months after Roosevelt's election, several governors declared bank holidays, temporarily closing banks so that their deposits could not be withdrawn.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 286\u2013289}} By the time Roosevelt took office, gubernatorial proclamations had closed the banks in 32 states; in the remaining states, many banks were closed and depositors were permitted to withdraw only five percent of their deposits.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=132\u2013133}} On March 5, Roosevelt declared a federal bank holiday, closing every bank in the nation. Though some questioned Roosevelt's constitutional authority to declare a bank holiday, his action received little immediate political resistance in light of the severity of the crisis.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 286\u2013289}} Working with the outgoing secretary of the treasury, [[Ogden L. Mills|Ogden Mills]], the Roosevelt administration spent the next few days putting together a bill designed to rescue the banking industry.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\nWhen the special session of Congress that had been called by Roosevelt opened on March 9, Congress quickly passed Roosevelt's [[Emergency Banking Act]]. Rather than nationalizing the financial industry, as some radicals hoped and many conservatives feared, the bill used federal assistance to stabilize privately owned banks.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=139\u2013140}} The ensuing \"[[Hundred Days Congress|First 100 Days]]\" of the 73rd Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 312}} and set a benchmark against which future presidents would be compared.<ref name=\"kliptak1\">{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Kevin|title=History of measuring presidents' first 100 days|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/23/politics/donald-trump-history-100-days/index.html|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=CNN|date=23 April 2017}}</ref> When the banks reopened on Monday, March 13, stock prices rose by 15 percent and bank deposits exceeded withdrawals, thus ending the bank panic.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 315\u2013316}}\n\nIn another measure designed to give Americans confidence in the financial system, Congress enacted the [[1933 Banking Act|Glass\u2013Steagall Act]], which curbed speculation by limiting the investments commercial banks could make and ending affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=165\u2013166}} Depositors in open banks received insurance coverage from the new [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), while depositors in permanently closed banks were eventually repaid 85 cents on the dollar. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, \"We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future.\" But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.<ref>Christopher W. Shaw, \"'The Man in the Street Is for It': The Road to the FDIC.\" ''Journal of Policy History'' 27#1 (2015): pp. 36-60, quote p 47.</ref>\n\n==== Relief for unemployed ====\n\nRelief for the unemployed was a major priority for the New Deal, and Roosevelt copied the programs he had initiated as governor of New York.<ref>William W.

FERA was led by Harry Hopkins, who had helmed a similar program under Roosevelt in New York.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=97\u201398}} Another agency, the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), was created to fund infrastructure projects, and was led by Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|p=156}} Seeking to increase the federal role in providing work relief, Hopkins successfully pushed for the creation of the [[Civil Works Administration]] (CWA), which would provide employment for anyone who was unemployed. In less than four months, the CWA hired four million people, and during its five months of operation, the CWA built and repaired 200 swimming pools, 3,700 playgrounds, 40,000 schools, {{convert|250000|mi|km}} of road, and 12 million feet of sewer pipe.<ref>Jeff *Singleton, ''The American Dole: Unemployment Relief and the Welfare State in the Great Depression'' (2000) [https://www.questia.com/read/24419587 online edition]</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}} The CWA was widely popular, but Roosevelt canceled it in March 1934 due to cost concerns and the fear of establishing a precedent that the government would serve as a permanent [[employer of last resort]].{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=99}}\n\n[[File:CCC-poster-1935.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Poster by Albert M.

Pederson, ed. ''A Companion to Franklin D. Roosevelt'' (2011) pp 288-90.</ref> The CCC hired 250,000 unemployed young men to work for six months on rural projects. It was directed by [[Robert Fechner]], a former union executive who promised labor unions that the enrollees would not be trained in skills that would compete with unemployed union members. Instead, they did unskilled construction labor, building roads and recreational facilities in state and national parks. Each CCC camp was administered by a U.S. Army reserve officer. Food, supplies, and medical services were purchased locally. The young men who worked at CCC camps were paid a dollar a day, most of which went to their parents. Blacks were enrolled in their own camps, and the CCC operated an entirely separate division for Indians.<ref>J. A. Salmond, ''The Civilian Conservation Corps, 1933\u20131942; a New Deal Case Study'' (1967).</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==== Agriculture ====\n{{see also|Agricultural policy of the United States}}\n\nRoosevelt placed a high emphasis on agricultural issues. Farmers made up thirty percent of the nation's workforce, and New Dealers hoped that an agricultural recovery would help stimulate the broader economy.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=200\u2013201}} Leadership of the farm programs of the New Deal lay with Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, a dynamic, intellectual reformer.<ref>Roger Biles, ''A New Deal for the American people'' (1991) pp 57-77.</ref><ref>Anthony J. Badger, ''The New Deal: the depression years 1933\u20131940'' (1989) pp 147-89.</ref> The persistent [[farm crisis]] of the 1920s was further exacerbated by the onset of the Great Depression, and foreclosures were common among debt-ridden farms.<ref>Lee J.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2121054 in JSTOR]</ref> Farmers were locked in a vicious cycle in which low prices encouraged individual farmers to engage in greater production, which in turn lowered prices by providing greater supply. The Hoover administration had created the [[Federal Farm Board]] to help address the issue of overproduction by purchasing agricultural surpluses, but it failed to stabilize prices.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=199\u2013200}} In the 1930s, Midwestern farmers would additionally have to contend with a series of severe [[dust storm]]s known as the [[Dust Bowl]], provoking migration from the affected regions.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 405\u2013406}}\n\nThe 1933 [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] created the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA). The act reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations, especially the [[Farm Bureau]], and reflected debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Wallace, [[M.L. Wilson]], [[Rexford Tugwell]], and [[George Peek]].<ref>Arthus Schlesinger, Jr., ''The Coming of the New Deal'' (1958) pp. 27\u201384</ref> The aim of the AAA was to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity. The AAA used a system of \"domestic allotments\", setting the total output of corn, cotton, dairy products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and wheat. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle; funding for the subsidies was provided by a new tax on food processing. The goal was to force up farm prices to the point of \"parity,\" an index based on 1910\u20131914 prices. To meet 1933 goals, {{convert|10|e6acre|km2}} of growing cotton was plowed up, bountiful crops were left to rot, and six million piglets were killed and discarded.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Depression and New Deal in Virginia.'' (1983) p. 107</ref> Farm incomes increased significantly in the first three years of the New Deal, as prices for commodities rose.<ref>Anthony Badger, ''The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933\u20131940'' (2002) p. 89. 153-57</ref> However, some [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] suffered under the new system, as some landowners pocketed the federal subsidies distributed for keeping lands fallow.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n[[File:Langechildren2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A migrant farm family in California, March 1935. Photo by [[Dorothea Lange]].]]\n\nThe AAA was the first federal agricultural program to operate on such a large scale, and it established a long-lasting federal role in the planning of the entire agricultural sector of the economy.<ref>Charles Kenneth Roberts, ''Farm Security Administration and Rural Rehabilitation in the South'' (University of Tennessee Press, 2015)</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}} In 1936, the Supreme Court declared the AAA to be unconstitutional for technical reasons. With the passage of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], the AAA was replaced by a similar program that did win Court approval. Instead of paying farmers for letting fields lie barren, the new program subsidized them for planting soil enriching hay crops such as [[alfalfa]] that would not be sold on the market. Federal regulation of agricultural production has been modified many times since then, but the basic philosophy of subsidizing farmers remains in effect.<ref>James L. Novak, James W. Pease, and Larry D. Sanders.

Agencies such as the Resettlement Administration and its successor, the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA), represented the first national programs to help migrants and marginal farmers, whose plight gained national attention through the 1939 novel and film ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. New Deal leaders resisted demands of the poor for loans to buy farms, as many leaders thought that there were already too many farmers.<ref>Rexford G.

Though the more ambitious experiments of the TVA generally failed to take hold, by 1940, the TVA had become the largest producer of electric power in the country.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=87\u201389}} The Roosevelt administration also established the [[Bonneville Power Administration|Bonneville Power Authority]], which performed similar functions to the TVA in the [[Pacific Northwest]], albeit on a smaller scale.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=379}}\n\n==== Industry ====\n\nThe Roosevelt administration launched the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) as one of the two major programs designed to restore economic prosperity, along with the AAA.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=97}} The NRA was established by the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of 1933, and was designed to implement reforms in the industrial sector.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 374\u2013375}} The framers of the NRA were heavily influenced by the work of [[Charles R. Van Hise]], a Progressive academic who saw [[trust (business)|trust]]s as an inevitable feature of an industrialized society. Rather than advocating for [[History of United States antitrust law|antitrust laws]] designed to prevent the growth of trusts, Hise had favored the creation of governmental organizations charged with regulating trusts.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=120\u2013121, 152}} The NRA tried to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as minimum prices, minimum wages, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the codes with the approval and guidance of NIRA officials. Other provisions encouraged the formation of unions and suspended anti-trust laws.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 377\u2013383}}\n\nRoosevelt appointed former General [[Hugh S. Johnson]] as the first head of the NRA, and Johnson sought to use the NRA to curb industrial overproduction and keep wages stable.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=177\u2013179}} The NRA won the pledges of two million businesses to create and follow NRA codes, and [[National Recovery Administration|Blue Eagle]] symbols, which indicated that a company cooperated with the NRA, became ubiquitous.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} The NRA targeted ten essential industries deemed crucial to an economic recovery, starting with textile industry and next turning to coal, oil, steel, automobiles, and lumber. Though unwilling to dictate the codes to industries, the administration pressured companies to agree to the codes and urged consumers to purchase products from companies in compliance with the codes.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 377\u2013383}} As each NRA code was unique to a specific industry, NRA negotiators held a great deal of sway in setting the details of the codes, and many of the codes favored managers over workers.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=70\u201371}} The NRA became increasingly unpopular among the general public due to its micromanagement, and many within the administration began to view it as ineffective.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=157\u2013158, 217}} The Supreme Court found the NRA to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision in May 1935.{{Sfn | Hawley | 1995 | p = 124}}\n\nDespite the abolition of the NRA, the New Deal saw the establishment or strengthening of several durable agencies designed to regulate specific industries. In 1934, Congress established the [[Federal Communications Commission]], which provided regulation to [[telephone]]s and [[radio]]. The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] was established in 1938 to regulate the nascent [[commercial aviation]] industry, while in 1935 the authority of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] was extended to the [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking industry]]. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] also received new duties.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=370\u2013374}}\n\n====Monetary policy====\n\nThe Agricultural Adjustment Act included the Thomas Amendment, a provision that allowed the president to reduce the gold content of the dollar, coin silver currency, and issue $3 billion in [[fiat money]]. In April 1933, Roosevelt took the United States off the [[gold standard]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=143\u2013144}} Going off the gold standard allowed Roosevelt to pursue [[inflation]]ary policies, which would make the operation of the NRA's programs, as well as the handling of public and private debt, easier. As part of his inflationary policies, Roosevelt refused to take part in efforts at the [[London Economic Conference]] to stabilize currency exchange rates.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=154\u2013158}} Roosevelt's \"bombshell\" message to that conference effectively ended any major efforts by the world powers to collaborate on ending the worldwide depression, and allowed Roosevelt a free hand in economic policy.<ref>[[#Leuchtenburg|Leuchtenburg (1963)]], pp. 199\u2013203.</ref> Though Roosevelt was willing to negotiate regarding tariffs, he refused to accept a [[fixed exchange-rate system]] or to reduce European debts incurred during [[World War I]].{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 364\u2013372}} In October 1933, the Roosevelt administration began a policy of buying gold in the hopes that such purchases would lead to inflation. The program was strongly criticized by observers like Keynes, as well as [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] administration officials such as [[Dean Acheson]], but it did appease many in rural communities.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=197\u2013199}} In 1935, Congress passed the [[Banking Act of 1935]], which brought the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] under the direct control of the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]], thereby increasing the Federal Reserve's ability to control the money supply and respond to business cycles.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n==== Securities regulation ====\n\nThe [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] established the independent [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to end irresponsible market manipulations and the dissemination of false information about securities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mario R. Di Nunzio|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Third American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rfPy7eXTEkC&pg=PA55|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=55|isbn=9780313392832}}</ref> Roosevelt named [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], a famously successful speculator himself, to head the SEC and clean up Wall Street. Kennedy appointed a hard-driving team with a mission for reform that included William O. Douglas, and [[Abe Fortas]], both of whom were later named to the Supreme Court.<ref> David Nasaw, ''The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy'' (2012) pp 204-37.</ref> The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had to get rid of the penny ante swindles based on false information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. Thirdly, and much more important than the frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers in major corporations, whereby insiders with access to information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow.<ref>Nassau, ''The Patriarch,'' pp 226-28</ref> By mandating the disclosure of business information and allowing investors to make informed decisions, the SEC largely succeed in its goal of restoring investor confidence.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=367\u2013368}}\n\nAs part of the first hundred days, Roosevelt fostered the passage of the [[Securities Act of 1933]]. The act expanded the powers of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and required companies issuing securities to disclose information regarding the securities they issued.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=42\u201343}} Another major securities law, the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]], broke up large public utility [[holding company|holding companies]]. The law arose from concerns that the holding companies had used elaborate measures to extract profits from subsidiary utility companies while taking advantage of customers.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n====Housing====\n\nHouse construction was widely seen as a potential component of an economic recovery. Though Keynes and Senator Wagner both favored large-scale public housing projects, the Roosevelt administration prioritized programs designed to boost private [[Home-ownership in the United States|home-ownership]]. In 1933, Roosevelt established the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]], which helped prevent mortgage [[foreclosure]]s by offering [[refinancing]] programs. The [[Federal Housing Administration]], established in 1934, set national home construction standards and provided insurance to long-term home mortgages. Another New Deal institution, [[Fannie Mae]], made home lending more appealing to lenders by helping to provide for the [[securitization]] of [[mortgage loan|mortgages]], thereby allowing mortgages to be sold on the [[secondary mortgage market]]. The housing institutions established under the New Deal did not appreciably contribute to new house building in the 1930s, but they played a major role in the post-war housing boom.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=368\u2013370}}\n\n====Ending prohibition====\nRoosevelt had generally avoided the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] issue, but when his party and the general public swung against Prohibition in 1932, he campaigned for repeal. During the Hundred Days he signed the [[Cullen\u2013Harrison Act]] redefining weak beer (3.2% alcohol) as the maximum allowed. The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] was ratified later that year; he was not involved in the amendment but was given much of the credit. The repeal of prohibition brought in new tax revenues to federal, state and local governments and helped Roosevelt keep a campaign promise that attracted widespread popular support. It also weakened the big-city criminal gangs that had profited heavily from illegal liquor sales.<ref>David E.

Roosevelt, among others, feared that the private sector would never again be able to provide [[full employment]] on its own. The major program created by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act was the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), led by Harry Hopkins.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=249\u2013253, 374\u2013375}} The WPA financed a variety of projects such as hospitals, schools, and roads, and employed more than 8.5&nbsp;million workers who built 650,000 miles of highways and roads, 125,000 public buildings, as well as bridges, reservoirs, irrigation systems, and other projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States.

Building new recreational facilities in public parks fit the model, and tens of thousands of recreation and sports facilities were built in both rural and urban areas. These projects had the main goal of providing jobs for the unemployed, but they also played to a widespread demand at the time for bodily fitness and the need of recreation in a healthy society. Roosevelt was a strong supporter of the recreation and sports dimension of his programs. The WPA spent $941 million on recreational facilities, including 5,900 athletic fields and playgrounds, 770 swimming pools 1,700 parks and 8,300 recreational buildings.<ref>John Wong,  \"FDR and the New Deal on Sport and Recreation.\" ''Sport History Review'' 29#2 (1998): 173-191 at p 181.</ref><ref>Donald S Howard, ''The WPA and Federal Relief Policy'', (1943) pp. 127, 130.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA), a semi-autonomous unit within the WPA, worked closely with high schools and colleges to set up work-study programs.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Robert Hamlett Bremner |title=Children and Youth in America: A Documentary History |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vsSiXoVuKTIC&pg=PA1603 |year=1974 |pages=1603\u20139|isbn=9780674116139 }}</ref><ref>''Report of the National Youth Administration, June 26, 1935, to June 30, 1938'' (1938) [https://archive.org/details/Nyareareport online]</ref> Under the leadership of [[Aubrey Willis Williams|Aubrey Williams]], the NYA developed apprenticeship programs and residential camps specializing in teaching vocational skills.

The proposal for a national health care system was dropped, but the committee developed an unemployment insurance program largely administered by the states. The committee also developed an old-age plan that, at Roosevelt's insistence, would be funded by individual contributions from workers.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=262\u2013266}}\n\nIn January 1935, Roosevelt proposed the [[Social Security Act]], which he presented as a more practical alternative to the Townsend Plan. After a series of congressional hearings, the Social Security Act became law in August 1935.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=270\u2013271}} During the congressional debate over Social Security, the program was expanded to provide payments to widows and dependents of Social Security recipients.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=108}} Job categories that were not covered by the act included workers in agricultural labor, domestic service, government employees, and many teachers, nurses, hospital employees, librarians, and social workers.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1994). ''The Color of Welfare: How Racism Undermined the War on Poverty''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 7.</ref> The program was funded through a newly established a payroll tax which later became known as the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]]. Social Security taxes would be collected from employers by the states, with employers and employees contributing equally to the tax.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=107}} Because the Social Security tax was [[Regressive tax|regressive]], and Social Security benefits were based on how much each individual had paid into the system, the program would not contribute to income redistribution in the way that some reformers, including Perkins, had hoped.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=267\u2013269}} In addition to creating the Social Security program, the Social Security Act also established a state-administered unemployment insurance system and the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Dependent Children]] program, which provided aid to families headed by single mothers.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=271\u2013272}} Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children and the handicapped.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States.

Roosevelt's strategy was to wait for demand for a program to materialize, and then, if he thought it popular enough, to throw his support behind it. Jaap Kooijman writes that Roosevelt succeeded in \"pacifying the opponents without discouraging the reformers.\" During World War II, a group of congressmen introduced the [[Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill]], which would provide federally funded [[universal health care]]. Roosevelt never endorsed it, and with conservative in control of Congress, it stood little chance of passage. Health insurance would be proposed in Truman's [[Fair Deal]], but it was defeated.<ref>Jaap Kooijman, \"Soon or Later on: Franklin D.

It prohibited [[unfair labor practice]]s such as discrimination against union members. The act also established the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but, together with the [[Norris\u2013La Guardia Act]] of 1932, its passage left labor unions in a favorable legal and political environment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=289\u2013291}} Other factors, including popular works that depicted the struggles of the working class, declining ethnic rivalries, and the [[La Follette Committee]]'s investigation of anti-labor abuses, further swung the public mood in favor of labor.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=303\u2013307}} The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector.<ref>Colin Gordon, ''New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920\u20131935'' (1994)  p. 225</ref> When the [[Flint sit-down strike]] threatened the production of [[General Motors]], Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 463\u2013467}} In the aftermath of the Flint sit-down strike, [[U.S. Steel]] granted recognition to the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=314\u2013315}} The total number of labor union members grew from three million in 1933 to eight million at the end of the 1930s, with the vast majority of union members living outside of the South.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=320}}\nHello\n\n===Other domestic policies===\n====Fiscal policy====\n[[File:U.S. federal government receipts and outlays, 1928 to 1941.png|thumb|400px|U.S. federal government revenues and expenditures during the 1930s]]\n\nRoosevelt argued that the emergency spending programs for relief were temporary, and he rejected the deficit spending proposed by economists such as [[John Maynard Keynes]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zelizer | first1 = Julian E. | year = 2000 | title = The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20101938 | url = | journal = Presidential Studies Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 332\u2013359 | doi=10.1111/j.0360-4918.2000.00115.x}}</ref> He kept his campaign promise to cut the regular federal budget&nbsp;\u2014 including a reduction in military spending from $752&nbsp;million in 1932 to $531&nbsp;million in 1934.

He sought higher taxes on top incomes, a higher [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]], a graduated [[corporate tax]], and the implementation of a tax on intercorporate dividends. In response, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1935]], which raised relatively little revenue but did increase taxes on the highest earners. A top tax rate of 79% was set for income above $5 million; in 1935, just one individual, [[John D. Rockefeller]], paid the top tax rate.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=275\u2013276}} In early 1936, following the passage of the Bonus Act, Roosevelt again sought to increase taxes on corporate profits. Congress passed a bill that raised less revenue that Roosevelt's proposals, but did impose an [[undistributed profits tax]] on corporate earnings.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\n====Conservation and the environment====\n\nRoosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate. Although FDR was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on TR's scale, his growth of the national systems were comparable. FDR created 140 national wildlife refuges (especially for birds) and established 29 national forests and 29 national parks and monuments,<ref>Douglas Brinkley, ''Rightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Land of America'' (2016)</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}<ref>Henry L. Henderson and David B. Woolner, eds. ''FDR and the Environment'' (2005).</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}} including [[Everglades National Park]] and [[Olympic National Park]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=379}} His environmental policy can be divided into three major domains. First of all his focus was on a few issues that had long concerned environmentalists: clean air and water, land management, preservation of forest lands, protection of wildlife, conservation of natural resources, and the creation of national parks and monuments.<ref>Byron W. Daynes and Glen Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment: Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush'' (2010) pp 29-35, 44</ref> Second, he created permanent institutional structures with environmental missions, including permanent institutions like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and temporary operations such as the CCC.<ref>Daynes and Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment''  (2010) pp 33-35, 44</ref> Finally, Roosevelt was a superb communicator with the people, and with Congress, using speeches and especially highly publicized  trips visiting key conservation locales.<ref>Daynes and Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment''  (2010) pp 29-33, 44</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's favorite agency, the CCC, expended most of its effort on environmental projects. In the dozen years after its creation, the CCC built 13,000 miles of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles of dirt roads. Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems.<ref>Brinkley, ''Rightful Heritage: Franklin D.

His administration initiated the construction of numerous dams located in the South and the West. Although proposals to replicate the Tennessee Valley Authority in the Pacific Northwest were not acted upon, the administration completed the [[All-American Canal]] and launched the [[Central Valley Project]], both of which irrigated dramatically increased agricultural production in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].  Roosevelt also presided over the establishment of conservation programs and laws such as the Soil Conservation Service, the [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]], and the [[Taylor Grazing Act of 1934]].{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=111\u2013116}}\n\nThroughout his first two terms there was a fierce turf battle over control of the [[United States Forest Service]], which Agriculture Secretary Henry Wallace insisted on keeping, but Interior Secretary Harold Ickes wanted so he could merge it with the [[National Park Service]]. The Brownlow Committee report on administrative management convinced Roosevelt to propose the creation of a new Department of Conservation to replace the Department of the Interior; the new department that would include the Forest Service. For Ickes, the land itself had a higher purpose than mere human usage; Wallace wanted the optimum economic productivity of public lands Both Interior and Agriculture had very strong supporters in Congress, and Roosevelt's plan went nowhere. The status quo triumphed.<ref>Richard Polenberg, \"The Great Conservation Contest.\" ''Forest History'' 10#4 (1967): pp. 13-23.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

It was specifically designed for the poor and staffed largely by women on relief. It was not based on professionalism, nor was it designed by experts. Instead it was premised on the anti-elitist notion that a good teacher does not need paper credentials, that learning does not need a formal classroom and that the highest priority should go to the bottom tier of society. Leaders in the public schools were shocked: they were shut out as consultants and as recipients of New Deal funding. They desperately needed cash to cover the local and state revenues that it disappeared during the depression, they were well organized, and made repeated concerted efforts in 1934, 1937, and 1939, all to no avail. The federal government had a highly professional Office of Education; Roosevelt cut its budget and staff, and refused to consult with its leader [[John Ward Studebaker]].<ref>David Tyack et al. ''Public Schools in Hard times: the Great Depression and Recent Years'' (1984) pp. 93-107.</ref> The CCC programs were deliberately designed not teach skills that would put them in competition with unemployed union members.

The CWA and FERA focused on hiring unemployed people on relief, and putting them to work on public buildings, including public schools. It built or upgraded 40,000 schools, plus thousands of playgrounds and athletic fields. It gave jobs to 50,000 teachers to keep rural schools open and to teach adult education classes in the cities.

In relief programs, they were eligible for jobs only if they were the breadwinner in the family. During the 1930s there was a strong national consensus that in times of job shortages, it was wrong for the government to employ both a husband and his wife.<ref>Ruth Milkman points out that, \"The 1932 federal Economy Act included a 'married persons' clause stipulating that whenever layoffs took place in the executive branch, married persons whose spouses were federal government employees should be the first to go....this nearly always meant firing married women.

In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld a state minimum wage law that was similar to a state law that the court had struck down the year before; the difference between the cases was that Roberts switched his vote. The case was widely seen as an important shift in the Court's judicial philosophy, and one newspaper called Roberts's vote \"[[the switch in time that saved nine]]\" because it effectively ended any chance of passing the court-packing bill. Later in 1937, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the NLRB and the major provisions of the Social Security Act.

Britain and France remained neutral and worked to get the major powers to agree to an arms embargo on both sides. In solidarity with them, Roosevelt recommended to Congress a nondiscriminatory arms embargo in January 1937, and won near-unanimous approval. Though privately supportive of the Republicans, Roosevelt feared the Spanish crisis might escalate to a full-scale European war and cooperated with the other democracies to contain the conflict. He also did not want to alienate American Catholics, a key element of his coalition; Catholic leaders were mostly pro-Franco. By spring 1938, as it was clear that Hitler and Mussolini were aiding Franco, Roosevelt was considering a plan to secretly sell American warplanes to the Spanish government, but nothing came of it. As the Nationalists were achieving victory in early 1939, Roosevelt would refer to the embargo as a mistake.

In a reflection of the continuing strength of isolationism, the [[Ludlow Amendment]], which would have required a national referendum for any declaration of war, was only narrowly defeated in the House.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=401\u2013403}} Roosevelt gained world attention with his October 1937 [[Quarantine Speech]], which called for an international \"quarantine\" against the \"epidemic of world lawlessness.\" He did not at this point seek sanctions against Japan, but he did begin strategic planning to build long-range submarines that could blockade Japan.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Williamson | last1 = Murray | first2 = Allan R | last2 = Millett | title = A war to be won: fighting the Second World War | year = 2001 | pages = 223\u20134}}</ref><ref>Travis Beal Jacobs, \"Roosevelt's 'Quarantine Speech'\" ''Historian''  24#4 (1962) pp. 483-502 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24438020 online]</ref>{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=511\u2013512}}<ref>John McVickar Haight, Jr., \"Franklin D.

In a last desperate effort to keep the peace, Britain and France agreed to German demands with the September 1938 [[Munich Agreement]].

In response, the British announced their commitment to defending [[Poland]], which many assumed Hitler would attack next.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\nAfter the Munich Agreement, Roosevelt began to prepare for the imminent outbreak of war. He called for the revision of the Neutrality Act in his 1939 State of the Union Address, but his proposal was defeated in both houses of Congress.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=419\u2013423}} Roosevelt ordered an increase in aircraft production, with a concentration on long-range bombers, especially the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].<ref>Jeffery S. Underwood, ''The Wings of Democracy: The Influence of Air Power on the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20131941'' (1991).</ref> In early 1939, Roosevelt allowed the French to place large orders with the American aircraft industry on a cash-and-carry basis, as allowed by law. Most of the aircraft ordered had not arrived in France by the time of its collapse in May 1940, so Roosevelt arranged for French orders to be sold to the British.<ref>Kevin E.

Roosevelt'' (2011), pp 493-516.</ref>\n\n===World War II begins in Europe===\n\n\nWorld War II began in September 1939 with Germany's [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. Western leaders were stunned when the Soviet Union and Germany [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|split control of Poland]]; the two powers had reached [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] in August 1939, which contained a secret protocol for the partition of Poland.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=517\u2013518}} Though few Americans wanted to intervene in the war, an October 1939 Gallup poll showed that over 80 percent of the country favored Britain and France over Germany.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=426\u2013427}} Per the terms of the Neutrality Act, Roosevelt recognized a state of war in Europe, imposing an arms embargo on France, Britain, and Germany. Days later, Roosevelt called Congress into a special session to revise the Neutrality Act. Overcoming the opposition of famous aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] and other isolationists, Roosevelt won passage of the Neutrality Act of 1939, which allowed belligerents to purchase aircraft and other combat material from the United States, albeit only on a cash and carry basis.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=432\u2013434}} Though the United States would remain officially neutral until December 1941, Roosevelt continued to seek ways to assist Britain and France.{{Sfn | Black | 2005 | pp = 503\u20136}} \n\nDuring the so-called \"[[Phony War]],\" a period of inactivity in Europe following the conclusion of the invasion of Poland, Roosevelt tried to negotiate a peace, but Hitler was uninterested in such a possibility.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=435\u2013436}} Japan, meanwhile, grew increasingly assertive in the Pacific, demanding that the French and British colonies close their borders with China.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 568\u2013570}} Beginning in September 1939, Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with [[Winston Churchill]], who became the British prime minister in May 1940.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=442\u2013443}} Germany invaded [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] in April 1940 and invaded the [[Low Countries]] and France in May. As France's situation grew increasingly desperate, Churchill and French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] appealed to Roosevelt for an American entry into the war, but Roosevelt was still unwilling to challenge the isolationist sentiment in the United States.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 548\u2013552}} With France on the verge of surrender, Italy also launched an invasion of France.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=439\u2013440}} France surrendered on June 22, resulting in the division of France into a German-controlled zone and a partially occupied area known [[Vichy France]]. Roosevelt tried to work with Vichy France from 1940 to 1942 to keep it neutral, with scant success.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zahniser | first1 = Marvin R. | year = 1987 | title = The French Connection: Thirty Years of French-American Relations | journal = Reviews in American History | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 486\u2013492 | jstor=2702049| doi = 10.2307/2702049 }}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], Britain and its dominions became the lone major force at war with Germany. Roosevelt, who was determined that Britain not be defeated, took advantage of the rapid shifts of public opinion; the fall of [[Paris]] especially led to a decline in isolationist sentiment.{{Sfn | Leuchtenberg | 1963 | pp = 399\u2013402}} Radio coverage of the [[Battle of Britain]], an aerial campaign in which Germany attempted to air superiority and bombed British targets, further galvanized American public opinion behind Britain.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=523}} Overcoming the opposition of much of the military establishment, who doubted Britain's ability to remain in the war against Germany, Roosevelt pursued policies designed to maximize arms transfers to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=446\u2013450}} In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.<ref>[[#Burns|Burns (1956)]], p. 420.</ref> The military build-up and the British purchase of armaments had a beneficial effect on the economy, and the unemployment rate fell to 14.6 percent in late 1940.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=464}}\n\nOn September 2, 1940, Roosevelt defied the spirit of the Neutrality Acts in reaching the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]. In exchange for the use of British military bases in the Caribbean Islands, the U.S. transferred 50 old World War I American [[destroyer]]s, which were to be used to defend against German submarines.<ref>Richard M. Pious, \"The Historical Presidency: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Destroyer Deal: Normalizing Prerogative Power.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 42#1 (2012): 190-204.</ref> The destroyers themselves held relatively little military importance, but the deal represented a symbolic American commitment to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=453\u2013454}} Later in September 1940, with the backing of both major party presidential candidates, Congress authorized the nation's first ever peacetime draft.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=459\u2013460}} Hitler and Mussolini responded to the Destroyers for Bases Agreement by joining with Japan in the [[Tripartite Pact]], and the three countries became known as the [[Axis powers]].{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | pp = 437-52}} The Tripartite Act was specifically designed to intimidate the United States into remaining neutral in the Sino-Japanese War and the war in Europe.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=505\u2013506}}\n\nAs Roosevelt took a firmer stance against the Axis Powers, American isolationists like Lindbergh and [[America First Committee|America First]] vehemently attacked the president as an irresponsible warmonger. In turn they were denounced as anti-Semitic dupes of the Nazis. Reviewer Richard S. Faulkner paraphrases Lynne Olson in arguing that, \"Lindbergh was far from the simple anti-Semite and pro-Nazi dupe that the Roosevelt administration and pro-intervention press often portrayed him to be, but was rather a man whose technical and clinical mind had him convinced that Britain could not win the war and America\u2019s lack of military preparedness meant that intervention was immoral, illogical, and suicidal.\"<ref>Richard S.

The [[New Deal coalition]], as it became known, made the Democratic Party the majority party in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. The American political system that incorporated the coalition and its opposition is characterized by scholars as the [[Fifth Party System]].<ref>James Ciment, ''Encyclopedia of the Great Depression and the New Deal'' (2001) Vol. 1 p. 6</ref><ref>John M. Allswang, ''New Deal and American Politics'' (1978) and [[Kristi Andersen]], ''The Creation of a Democratic Majority, 1928\u20131936'' (1979), and Everett Carll Ladd Jr., ''Transformations of the American Party System: Political Coalitions from the New Deal to the 1970s'' (2nd ed. 1978) are based on voting statistics and polls.</ref> The New Deal coalition had the most dramatic effect in the North, as the Democrats became competitive throughout the region for the first time since the end of the Civil War.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\n===Northern whites===\nThe impact of the Prohibition issue, the Great Depression, the New Deal and World War II on white ethnic groups (mostly Catholics and Jews) was enormous. Political participation was low among the \"new\" immigrants who arrived after 1890; the established machines did not need their votes. The Depression hit these new immigrants hard, for they had low skill levels and were concentrated in heavy industry. They strongly responded to work relief programs and other aspects of the New Deal, becoming one of the largest and most critical voting blocs in the New Deal coalition. Roosevelt scored large majorities among the main Catholics groups up to 1940. In particular he largely retained the support the Irish, despite Al Smith's repudiation of the New Deal.<ref>Ronald Bayor, ''Neighbors in Conflict: The Irish, Germans, Jews, and Italians of New York City, 1929\u20131941'' (1978)</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nRoosevelt also won over working class Protestant voters and progressive Republicans. Many of these progressives continued to vote for Republican congressional candidates, but others joined the Democratic Party. In western states like North Dakota, progressive voters defected en masse to the Democratic Party and became influential in the state party organization. At the same time, many conservative, rural voters returned to the Republican Party after 1932, diminishing the influence of conservative Northern Democrats.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\n===African American politics===\n{{See also|Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights}}\n\nRoosevelt appointed African Americans to an unprecedented number of political positions; [[William H. Hastie]] became the first African American federal judge. Roosevelt also established an informal \"[[Black Cabinet]]\" to advise him on African-American affairs.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=378}} Roosevelt supported policies designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for non-white workers in the South.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=307\u2013308}} In response to Roosevelt's policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic [[voting bloc]] in several Northern states.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=162\u2013163}} However, Roosevelt needed the support of the powerful white Southern Democrats for his New Deal programs, and blacks were still disenfranchised in most of the South. He decided against pushing for legislation that would make lynching a federal crime; such legislation could not pass over a Southern filibuster and the political fight would threaten his ability to pass his priority programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dubay | first1 = Robert W. | year = 1968 | title = Mississippi and the Proposed Federal Anti-Lynching Bills of 1937\u20131938 | url = | journal = Southern Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 73\u201389}}</ref> He did denounce lynchings as \"a vile form of collective murder,\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Harvard Sitkoff|title=Toward Freedom Land: The Long Struggle for Racial Equality in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K87-4rCCsgoC&pg=PA37|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=37|isbn=978-0813139753}}</ref>\n\n===Labor unions===\n[[File:1936 FDR \"Don't Be Fooled by Figures\" Re-election handbill.jpg|thumb|1936 re-election handbill for Roosevelt promoting his economic policy.]]\n\nRoosevelt at first had massive support from the rapidly growing labor unions; one laborer summed up the feeling of many workers when he stated that, \"Mr. Roosevelt is the only man we ever had in the White House who would understand that my boss is a sonofabitch.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=296\u2013297}} Beginning in the mid-to-late 1930s, labor would suffered from a bitter a split that weakened its political power. [[John L. Lewis]], the head of the [[United Mine Workers]] (UMW), favored using the UMW's parent organization, the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), to organize unskilled workers. After the AFL rejected his proposal, Lewis formed the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) in 1935.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=301\u2013302}} Roosevelt pronounced a \"plague on both your houses,\" but labor's disunity weakened the party in the elections from 1938 through 1946.<ref>{{Citation | editor-first = William D | editor-last = Pederson | title = A Companion to Franklin D.

While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by Al Smith, fought back with the [[American Liberty League]], savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].<ref name= Fried>{{Citation | last = Fried | title = Roosevelt and his Enemies | year = 2001 | pages = 120\u201323}}</ref> Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal, contributing to Roosevelt's 1936 landslide.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 350}} Early in Roosevelt's term, many Republicans supported New Deal programs, but as progressives left the party or suffered electoral defeat, they became increasingly unified in opposition to Roosevelt.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=145}} Roosevelt also faced challenges from the left, though the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] was unable to win broad support even in the depths of the Great Depression.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=223\u2013224}} A group led by [[Huey Long]], Father [[Charles Coughlin]], and Francis Townsend, attempted to launch a political party to challenge Roosevelt from the left. They launched a short-lived party known as the [[Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] to challenge Roosevelt in 1936, but it quickly collapsed.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=136\u2013139}} Roosevelt also drew the opposition of some individuals who had been part of the [[Progressive Era|Progressive Movement]] in the early 20th century, as many of these former progressives distrusted large government programs like the NRA.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=135}}\n\n==List of international trips==\nFDR made one international trip while president-elect and a total of twenty throughout his four terms as president.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/roosevelt-franklin-d|title= Travels of President Franklin D.

Both [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] were attacked for trying to obtain a third non-consecutive term. Roosevelt systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination, including Vice President John Nance Garner<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. | series =[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] | title = The Path to Power | year = 1982 | publisher = [[Alfred A.

Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine, which controlled the auditorium sound system. At the convention the opposition was poorly organized, but Farley had packed the galleries. Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run unless he was drafted, and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone. The delegates were stunned; then the loudspeaker screamed \"We want Roosevelt... The world wants Roosevelt!\" The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot. The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful, as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 428}} At Roosevelt's request, the convention nominated Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace for vice president. Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal, but were unable to prevent his nomination.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=457\u2013458}}\n\nWorld War II shook up the Republican field, possibly preventing the nomination of isolationist congressional leaders like Taft or Vandenberg. The [[1940 Republican National Convention]] instead nominated [[Wendell Willkie]], the first major party nominee since [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] who had never held public office. A well-known corporate attorney and executive, Willkie rose to public notice through his criticism of the New Deal and his clashes with the TVA. Unlike his isolationist rivals for the Republican nomination, Willkie favored Britain in the war, and he was backed by internationalist Republicans like [[Henry Luce]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=455\u2013456}} Willkie's internationalist views initially prevented the issue of foreign policy from dominating the campaign, helping to allow for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and the establishment of a peacetime draft.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=459\u2013460}}\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Willkie and other Republicans stepped up their attacks on Roosevelt's foreign policy. Willkie warned that Roosevelt's re-election would lead to the deployment of U.S. troops abroad. In response, Roosevelt stated that \"Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=462\u2013463}} Roosevelt won the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]] with 55% of the popular vote and almost 85% of the electoral vote (449 to 82).{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 454}} Willkie won ten states: strongly Republican states of Vermont and Maine, and eight isolationist states in the Midwest.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=463\u2013464}} The Democrats retained their congressional majorities, but the conservative coalition largely controlled domestic legislation and remained \"leery of presidential extensions of executive power through social programs.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor=Paul Finkelman |editor2=Peter Wallenstein |title=The encyclopedia of American political history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IYYAAAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=CQ Press|page=332|isbn=9781568025117 }}</ref>\n\nAfter his victory over Willkie, Roosevelt embarked on a public campaign to win congressional support for aid to the British.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} In December 1940, Roosevelt received a letter from Churchill asking the U.S. to repeal the cash and carry provision of the Neutrality Act. With British forces committed to defending against Germany, Churchill asked for the United States to provide loans and shipping for American goods.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=467\u2013468}} In response, Roosevelt delivered a speech in which he called for the United States to serve as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]],\" supplying aid to those resisting Germany and other aggressors.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} He stated, \"if Great Britain goes down, the Axis Powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas\u2013and they will be in a position to bring enormous military military and naval resources against this hemisphere.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=401\u2013402}} In his January 1941 [[Four Freedoms]] speech, Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=487\u2013488}} In that same speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to approve a [[Lend-Lease]] program designed to provide military aid to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=469\u2013470}} Roosevelt's [[Presidency of Franklin D.

Roosevelt series}}\n\nThe '''first and second terms of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt''' began on March 4, 1933, when he was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|32nd]] [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]], and ended with [[Third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's third inauguration]] on January 20, 1941. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], took office after defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Herbert Hoover]], who had presided over the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Upon his accession to office, Roosevelt led the implementation of the [[New Deal]], a series of programs designed to provide relief, recovery, and reform to Americans and the American economy.\n\nDuring his [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|first hundred days]] in office, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented major legislation and issued a profusion of [[executive order]]s. The [[Emergency Banking Act]] helped put an end to a run on banks, while the [[1933 Banking Act]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] provided major reforms in the financial sector. To provide relief to unemployed workers, Roosevelt presided over the establishment of several agencies, including the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], the [[Public Works Administration]], and the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]]. The Roosevelt administration established the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act|Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] to implement new policies designed to prevent agricultural overproduction. It also established several agencies, most notably the [[National Recovery Administration]], to reform the industrial sector, though the National Recovery Administration was struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter his party's success in the 1934 mid-term elections, Roosevelt presided over the establishment of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), another major work relief agency. He also won passage of the [[Social Security Act]], which created a national old-age pension program known as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. The same act also established a national [[unemployment insurance]] program, as well as the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Dependent Children]], which provided aid to families headed by single mothers. A third major piece of legislation, the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]], guaranteed workers the right of [[collective bargaining]] and established the [[National Labor Relations Board]]. After winning re-election in 1936, Roosevelt sought to [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], but his proposal was defeated in Congress. Roosevelt experienced less success in passing domestic legislation in his second term, as the bipartisan [[Conservative Coalition]] blocked most of his legislative proposals, aside from the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]. Nonetheless, Roosevelt built a \"[[New Deal Coalition]]\" of labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African Americans, and rural white Southerners, that would significantly realign American politics for the next several decades in the [[Fifth Party System]] and also define [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]].\n\nThe 1930s were a high point of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]] in the United States. The key foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], in which the U.S. took a non-interventionist stance in [[Latin America]]n affairs. Foreign policy issues came to the fore in the late 1930s, as [[Nazi Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] took aggressive actions against other countries. In response to fears that the United States would be drawn into foreign conflicts, Congress passed the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]], a series of laws that prevented trade with belligerents. After Japan [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invaded China]] and Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded]] [[Poland]], Roosevelt provided aid to [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[French Third Republic|France]], but the Neutrality Acts prevented the United States from becoming closely involved. After the [[Fall of France]] in June 1940, Roosevelt increased aid to the British and began to build up American military power. In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]], Roosevelt defeated Republican [[Wendell Willkie]], an internationalist who largely refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's foreign policy. He would go on to serve a [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, third and fourth terms|third term and part of a fourth term]].\n\n==Election of 1932==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1932}}\n\nWith the economy ailing after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], many Democrats hoped that the 1932 elections would see the election of the first Democratic president since [[Woodrow Wilson]], who left office in 1921. Roosevelt's [[New York state election, 1930|1930 gubernatorial re-election victory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination. With the help of allies such as [[Louis Howe]], [[James Farley]], and [[Edward M. House]], Roosevelt rallied the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] supporters of the Wilson while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the [[Southern United States|South]] and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives such as [[Al Smith]], the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee. Smith hoped to deny Roosevelt the two-thirds support necessary to win the party's presidential nomination [[1932 Democratic National Convention]], and then emerge as the nominee after multiple rounds of balloting. Roosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1932|1932 Democratic primaries]], but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Speaker of the House [[John Nance Garner]], who controlled the votes of Texas and California, threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot. With little input from Roosevelt, Garner won the vice presidential nomination. Roosevelt flew in from New York after learning that he had won the nomination, becoming the first major party presidential nominee to accept the nomination in person.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 232\u2013236, 246\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1932.svg|right|thumb|275px|1932 electoral vote results]]\n\nIn the general election, Roosevelt faced incumbent Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]]. Engaging in a cross-country campaign, Roosevelt promised to increase the federal government's [[Economic interventionism|role in the economy]] and to lower the [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] as part of a \"[[New Deal]].\" Hoover argued that the economic collapse had chiefly been the product of international disturbances, and he accused Roosevelt of promoting [[class conflict]] with his novel economic policies. Already unpopular due to the bad economy, Hoover's re-election hopes were further hampered by the [[Bonus Army|Bonus March 1932]], which ended with the violent dispersal of thousands of protesting [[veteran]]s. Roosevelt won 472 of the 531 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] and 57.4% of the popular vote, making him the first Democratic presidential nominee since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to win a [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|majority of the popular vote]]. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1932|congressional elections]], the Democrats took control of the Senate and built upon their majority in the House.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 255\u2013265}} Though congressional Democratic leadership was dominated by conservative Southerners, over half of the members of the incoming [[73rd United States Congress|73rd Congress]] had been elected since 1930. Many of these new members were eager to take action to combat the Depression, even if it meant defying the political orthodoxy of the previous years.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=right\n|Name=Roosevelt\n|President=Franklin D.

Analyzing the president's administrative style, historian [[James MacGregor Burns]] concludes:\n:The president stayed in charge of his administration...by drawing fully on his formal and informal powers as Chief Executive; by raising goals, creating momentum, inspiring a personal loyalty, getting the best out of people...by deliberately fostering among his aides a sense of competition and a clash of wills that led to disarray, heartbreak, and anger but also set off pulses of executive energy and sparks of creativity...by handing out one job to several men and several jobs to one man, thus strengthening his own position as a court of appeals, as a depository of information, and as a tool of co-ordination; by ignoring or bypassing collective decision-making agencies, such as the Cabinet...and always by persuading, flattering, juggling, improvising, reshuffling, harmonizing, conciliating, manipulating.<ref>{{cite book|last=James MacGregor Burns|title=The Soldier of Freedom: Roosevelt|year=1970|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|pages=347\u201348}}</ref>\n\nFor his first Secretary of State, Roosevelt selected [[Cordell Hull]], a prominent Tennessean who had served in the House and Senate. Though Hull had not distinguished himself as a foreign policy expert, he was a long-time advocate of tariff reduction, was respected by his Senate colleagues, and did not hold ambitions for the presidency. Roosevelt's inaugural cabinet included several influential Republicans, including Secretary of the Treasury [[William H. Woodin]], a well-connected industrialist who was personally close to Roosevelt, Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]], a progressive Republican who would play an important role in the New Deal, and Secretary of Agriculture [[Henry A. Wallace]], who had advised the Roosevelt campaign on farm policies. Roosevelt also appointed the first female cabinet member, Secretary of Labor [[Frances C. Perkins]]. Farley became Postmaster General, while Howe became Roosevelt's personal secretary until his death in 1936.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 290\u2013295}} The selections of Hull, Woodin, and Secretary of Commerce [[Daniel C.

True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money.

Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal. Reform meant long-term fixes of what was wrong, especially with the financial and banking systems. Through Roosevelt's series of radio talks, known as [[fireside chats]], he presented his proposals directly to the American public.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 157, 167-68}} To propose programs, Roosevelt relied on leading senators such as [[George W. Norris|George Norris]], [[Robert F. Wagner]], and Hugo Black, as well as his [[Brain Trust]] of academic advisers. Like Hoover, he saw the Depression caused in part by people no longer spending or investing because they were afraid.<ref>Roger Biles, ''A New Deal for the American people'' (1991) pp 33-56.</ref>\n\n====Banking reform====\n{{listen |pos=right |filename=FDR speech.ogg |title=Nothing to Fear |description=Sample of the ''Inaugural speech'' from FDR |format=[[ogg]]}}\n\nBanking reform was perhaps the single most urgent task facing the newly inaugurated administration. Thousands of banks had failed or were on the verge of failing, and panicked depositors [[Bank run|sought to remove their savings]] from banks for fear that they would lose their deposits after a bank failure. In the months after Roosevelt's election, several governors declared bank holidays, temporarily closing banks so that their deposits could not be withdrawn.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 286\u2013289}} By the time Roosevelt took office, gubernatorial proclamations had closed the banks in 32 states; in the remaining states, many banks were closed and depositors were permitted to withdraw only five percent of their deposits.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=132\u2013133}} On March 5, Roosevelt declared a federal bank holiday, closing every bank in the nation.

Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, \"We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future.\" But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.<ref>Christopher W.

It was directed by [[Robert Fechner]], a former union executive who promised labor unions that the enrollees would not be trained in skills that would compete with unemployed union members. Instead, they did unskilled construction labor, building roads and recreational facilities in state and national parks. Each CCC camp was administered by a U.S. Army reserve officer. Food, supplies, and medical services were purchased locally. The young men who worked at CCC camps were paid a dollar a day, most of which went to their parents. Blacks were enrolled in their own camps, and the CCC operated an entirely separate division for Indians.<ref>J. A.

Farmers made up thirty percent of the nation's workforce, and New Dealers hoped that an agricultural recovery would help stimulate the broader economy.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=200\u2013201}} Leadership of the farm programs of the New Deal lay with Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, a dynamic, intellectual reformer.<ref>Roger Biles, ''A New Deal for the American people'' (1991) pp 57-77.</ref><ref>Anthony J.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2121054 in JSTOR]</ref> Farmers were locked in a vicious cycle in which low prices encouraged individual farmers to engage in greater production, which in turn lowered prices by providing greater supply. The Hoover administration had created the [[Federal Farm Board]] to help address the issue of overproduction by purchasing agricultural surpluses, but it failed to stabilize prices.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=199\u2013200}} In the 1930s, Midwestern farmers would additionally have to contend with a series of severe [[dust storm]]s known as the [[Dust Bowl]], provoking migration from the affected regions.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 405\u2013406}}\n\nThe 1933 [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] created the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA). The act reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations, especially the [[Farm Bureau]], and reflected debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Wallace, [[M.L. Wilson]], [[Rexford Tugwell]], and [[George Peek]].<ref>Arthus Schlesinger, Jr., ''The Coming of the New Deal'' (1958) pp. 27\u201384</ref> The aim of the AAA was to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity. The AAA used a system of \"domestic allotments\", setting the total output of corn, cotton, dairy products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and wheat. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle; funding for the subsidies was provided by a new tax on food processing. The goal was to force up farm prices to the point of \"parity,\" an index based on 1910\u20131914 prices. To meet 1933 goals, {{convert|10|e6acre|km2}} of growing cotton was plowed up, bountiful crops were left to rot, and six million piglets were killed and discarded.<ref>Ronald L.

With the passage of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], the AAA was replaced by a similar program that did win Court approval. Instead of paying farmers for letting fields lie barren, the new program subsidized them for planting soil enriching hay crops such as [[alfalfa]] that would not be sold on the market. Federal regulation of agricultural production has been modified many times since then, but the basic philosophy of subsidizing farmers remains in effect.<ref>James L. Novak, James W.

Agencies such as the Resettlement Administration and its successor, the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA), represented the first national programs to help migrants and marginal farmers, whose plight gained national attention through the 1939 novel and film ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. New Deal leaders resisted demands of the poor for loans to buy farms, as many leaders thought that there were already too many farmers.<ref>Rexford G.

Though the more ambitious experiments of the TVA generally failed to take hold, by 1940, the TVA had become the largest producer of electric power in the country.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=87\u201389}} The Roosevelt administration also established the [[Bonneville Power Administration|Bonneville Power Authority]], which performed similar functions to the TVA in the [[Pacific Northwest]], albeit on a smaller scale.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=379}}\n\n==== Industry ====\n\nThe Roosevelt administration launched the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) as one of the two major programs designed to restore economic prosperity, along with the AAA.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=97}} The NRA was established by the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of 1933, and was designed to implement reforms in the industrial sector.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 374\u2013375}} The framers of the NRA were heavily influenced by the work of [[Charles R. Van Hise]], a Progressive academic who saw [[trust (business)|trust]]s as an inevitable feature of an industrialized society. Rather than advocating for [[History of United States antitrust law|antitrust laws]] designed to prevent the growth of trusts, Hise had favored the creation of governmental organizations charged with regulating trusts.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=120\u2013121, 152}} The NRA tried to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as minimum prices, minimum wages, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the codes with the approval and guidance of NIRA officials. Other provisions encouraged the formation of unions and suspended anti-trust laws.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 377\u2013383}}\n\nRoosevelt appointed former General [[Hugh S. Johnson]] as the first head of the NRA, and Johnson sought to use the NRA to curb industrial overproduction and keep wages stable.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=177\u2013179}} The NRA won the pledges of two million businesses to create and follow NRA codes, and [[National Recovery Administration|Blue Eagle]] symbols, which indicated that a company cooperated with the NRA, became ubiquitous.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} The NRA targeted ten essential industries deemed crucial to an economic recovery, starting with textile industry and next turning to coal, oil, steel, automobiles, and lumber. Though unwilling to dictate the codes to industries, the administration pressured companies to agree to the codes and urged consumers to purchase products from companies in compliance with the codes.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 377\u2013383}} As each NRA code was unique to a specific industry, NRA negotiators held a great deal of sway in setting the details of the codes, and many of the codes favored managers over workers.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=70\u201371}} The NRA became increasingly unpopular among the general public due to its micromanagement, and many within the administration began to view it as ineffective.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=157\u2013158, 217}} The Supreme Court found the NRA to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision in May 1935.{{Sfn | Hawley | 1995 | p = 124}}\n\nDespite the abolition of the NRA, the New Deal saw the establishment or strengthening of several durable agencies designed to regulate specific industries. In 1934, Congress established the [[Federal Communications Commission]], which provided regulation to [[telephone]]s and [[radio]]. The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] was established in 1938 to regulate the nascent [[commercial aviation]] industry, while in 1935 the authority of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] was extended to the [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking industry]]. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] also received new duties.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=370\u2013374}}\n\n====Monetary policy====\n\nThe Agricultural Adjustment Act included the Thomas Amendment, a provision that allowed the president to reduce the gold content of the dollar, coin silver currency, and issue $3 billion in [[fiat money]]. In April 1933, Roosevelt took the United States off the [[gold standard]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=143\u2013144}} Going off the gold standard allowed Roosevelt to pursue [[inflation]]ary policies, which would make the operation of the NRA's programs, as well as the handling of public and private debt, easier. As part of his inflationary policies, Roosevelt refused to take part in efforts at the [[London Economic Conference]] to stabilize currency exchange rates.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=154\u2013158}} Roosevelt's \"bombshell\" message to that conference effectively ended any major efforts by the world powers to collaborate on ending the worldwide depression, and allowed Roosevelt a free hand in economic policy.<ref>[[#Leuchtenburg|Leuchtenburg (1963)]], pp. 199\u2013203.</ref> Though Roosevelt was willing to negotiate regarding tariffs, he refused to accept a [[fixed exchange-rate system]] or to reduce European debts incurred during [[World War I]].{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 364\u2013372}} In October 1933, the Roosevelt administration began a policy of buying gold in the hopes that such purchases would lead to inflation. The program was strongly criticized by observers like Keynes, as well as [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] administration officials such as [[Dean Acheson]], but it did appease many in rural communities.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=197\u2013199}} In 1935, Congress passed the [[Banking Act of 1935]], which brought the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] under the direct control of the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]], thereby increasing the Federal Reserve's ability to control the money supply and respond to business cycles.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n==== Securities regulation ====\n\nThe [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] established the independent [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to end irresponsible market manipulations and the dissemination of false information about securities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mario R.

Roosevelt and the Third American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rfPy7eXTEkC&pg=PA55|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=55|isbn=9780313392832}}</ref> Roosevelt named [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], a famously successful speculator himself, to head the SEC and clean up Wall Street. Kennedy appointed a hard-driving team with a mission for reform that included William O. Douglas, and [[Abe Fortas]], both of whom were later named to the Supreme Court.<ref> David Nasaw, ''The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy'' (2012) pp 204-37.</ref> The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had to get rid of the penny ante swindles based on false information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. Thirdly, and much more important than the frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers in major corporations, whereby insiders with access to information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow.<ref>Nassau, ''The Patriarch,'' pp 226-28</ref> By mandating the disclosure of business information and allowing investors to make informed decisions, the SEC largely succeed in its goal of restoring investor confidence.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=367\u2013368}}\n\nAs part of the first hundred days, Roosevelt fostered the passage of the [[Securities Act of 1933]]. The act expanded the powers of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and required companies issuing securities to disclose information regarding the securities they issued.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=42\u201343}} Another major securities law, the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]], broke up large public utility [[holding company|holding companies]]. The law arose from concerns that the holding companies had used elaborate measures to extract profits from subsidiary utility companies while taking advantage of customers.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n====Housing====\n\nHouse construction was widely seen as a potential component of an economic recovery. Though Keynes and Senator Wagner both favored large-scale public housing projects, the Roosevelt administration prioritized programs designed to boost private [[Home-ownership in the United States|home-ownership]]. In 1933, Roosevelt established the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]], which helped prevent mortgage [[foreclosure]]s by offering [[refinancing]] programs. The [[Federal Housing Administration]], established in 1934, set national home construction standards and provided insurance to long-term home mortgages. Another New Deal institution, [[Fannie Mae]], made home lending more appealing to lenders by helping to provide for the [[securitization]] of [[mortgage loan|mortgages]], thereby allowing mortgages to be sold on the [[secondary mortgage market]]. The housing institutions established under the New Deal did not appreciably contribute to new house building in the 1930s, but they played a major role in the post-war housing boom.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=368\u2013370}}\n\n====Ending prohibition====\nRoosevelt had generally avoided the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] issue, but when his party and the general public swung against Prohibition in 1932, he campaigned for repeal. During the Hundred Days he signed the [[Cullen\u2013Harrison Act]] redefining weak beer (3.2% alcohol) as the maximum allowed. The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] was ratified later that year; he was not involved in the amendment but was given much of the credit. The repeal of prohibition brought in new tax revenues to federal, state and local governments and helped Roosevelt keep a campaign promise that attracted widespread popular support. It also weakened the big-city criminal gangs that had profited heavily from illegal liquor sales.<ref>David E.

Roosevelt, among others, feared that the private sector would never again be able to provide [[full employment]] on its own. The major program created by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act was the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), led by Harry Hopkins.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=249\u2013253, 374\u2013375}} The WPA financed a variety of projects such as hospitals, schools, and roads, and employed more than 8.5&nbsp;million workers who built 650,000 miles of highways and roads, 125,000 public buildings, as well as bridges, reservoirs, irrigation systems, and other projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States.

Building new recreational facilities in public parks fit the model, and tens of thousands of recreation and sports facilities were built in both rural and urban areas. These projects had the main goal of providing jobs for the unemployed, but they also played to a widespread demand at the time for bodily fitness and the need of recreation in a healthy society. Roosevelt was a strong supporter of the recreation and sports dimension of his programs. The WPA spent $941 million on recreational facilities, including 5,900 athletic fields and playgrounds, 770 swimming pools 1,700 parks and 8,300 recreational buildings.<ref>John Wong,  \"FDR and the New Deal on Sport and Recreation.\" ''Sport History Review'' 29#2 (1998): 173-191 at p 181.</ref><ref>Donald S Howard, ''The WPA and Federal Relief Policy'', (1943) pp. 127, 130.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA), a semi-autonomous unit within the WPA, worked closely with high schools and colleges to set up work-study programs.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Robert Hamlett Bremner |title=Children and Youth in America: A Documentary History |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vsSiXoVuKTIC&pg=PA1603 |year=1974 |pages=1603\u20139|isbn=9780674116139 }}</ref><ref>''Report of the National Youth Administration, June 26, 1935, to June 30, 1938'' (1938) [https://archive.org/details/Nyareareport online]</ref> Under the leadership of [[Aubrey Willis Williams|Aubrey Williams]], the NYA developed apprenticeship programs and residential camps specializing in teaching vocational skills.

The proposal for a national health care system was dropped, but the committee developed an unemployment insurance program largely administered by the states. The committee also developed an old-age plan that, at Roosevelt's insistence, would be funded by individual contributions from workers.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=262\u2013266}}\n\nIn January 1935, Roosevelt proposed the [[Social Security Act]], which he presented as a more practical alternative to the Townsend Plan. After a series of congressional hearings, the Social Security Act became law in August 1935.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=270\u2013271}} During the congressional debate over Social Security, the program was expanded to provide payments to widows and dependents of Social Security recipients.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=108}} Job categories that were not covered by the act included workers in agricultural labor, domestic service, government employees, and many teachers, nurses, hospital employees, librarians, and social workers.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1994). ''The Color of Welfare: How Racism Undermined the War on Poverty''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 7.</ref> The program was funded through a newly established a payroll tax which later became known as the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]]. Social Security taxes would be collected from employers by the states, with employers and employees contributing equally to the tax.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|p=107}} Because the Social Security tax was [[Regressive tax|regressive]], and Social Security benefits were based on how much each individual had paid into the system, the program would not contribute to income redistribution in the way that some reformers, including Perkins, had hoped.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=267\u2013269}} In addition to creating the Social Security program, the Social Security Act also established a state-administered unemployment insurance system and the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Dependent Children]] program, which provided aid to families headed by single mothers.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=271\u2013272}} Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children and the handicapped.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States.

Roosevelt's strategy was to wait for demand for a program to materialize, and then, if he thought it popular enough, to throw his support behind it. Jaap Kooijman writes that Roosevelt succeeded in \"pacifying the opponents without discouraging the reformers.\" During World War II, a group of congressmen introduced the [[Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill]], which would provide federally funded [[universal health care]]. Roosevelt never endorsed it, and with conservative in control of Congress, it stood little chance of passage. Health insurance would be proposed in Truman's [[Fair Deal]], but it was defeated.<ref>Jaap Kooijman, \"Soon or Later on: Franklin D.

It prohibited [[unfair labor practice]]s such as discrimination against union members. The act also established the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but, together with the [[Norris\u2013La Guardia Act]] of 1932, its passage left labor unions in a favorable legal and political environment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=289\u2013291}} Other factors, including popular works that depicted the struggles of the working class, declining ethnic rivalries, and the [[La Follette Committee]]'s investigation of anti-labor abuses, further swung the public mood in favor of labor.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=303\u2013307}} The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector.<ref>Colin Gordon, ''New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920\u20131935'' (1994)  p. 225</ref> When the [[Flint sit-down strike]] threatened the production of [[General Motors]], Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 463\u2013467}} In the aftermath of the Flint sit-down strike, [[U.S. Steel]] granted recognition to the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=314\u2013315}} The total number of labor union members grew from three million in 1933 to eight million at the end of the 1930s, with the vast majority of union members living outside of the South.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=320}}\n\n===Other domestic policies===\n====Fiscal policy====\n[[File:U.S. federal government receipts and outlays, 1928 to 1941.png|thumb|400px|U.S. federal government revenues and expenditures during the 1930s]]\n\nRoosevelt argued that the emergency spending programs for relief were temporary, and he rejected the deficit spending proposed by economists such as [[John Maynard Keynes]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zelizer | first1 = Julian E. | year = 2000 | title = The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20101938 | url = | journal = Presidential Studies Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 332\u2013359 | doi=10.1111/j.0360-4918.2000.00115.x}}</ref> He kept his campaign promise to cut the regular federal budget&nbsp;\u2014 including a reduction in military spending from $752&nbsp;million in 1932 to $531&nbsp;million in 1934.

He sought higher taxes on top incomes, a higher [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]], a graduated [[corporate tax]], and the implementation of a tax on intercorporate dividends. In response, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1935]], which raised relatively little revenue but did increase taxes on the highest earners. A top tax rate of 79% was set for income above $5 million; in 1935, just one individual, [[John D. Rockefeller]], paid the top tax rate.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=275\u2013276}} In early 1936, following the passage of the Bonus Act, Roosevelt again sought to increase taxes on corporate profits. Congress passed a bill that raised less revenue that Roosevelt's proposals, but did impose an [[undistributed profits tax]] on corporate earnings.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\n====Conservation and the environment====\n\nRoosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate. Although FDR was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on TR's scale, his growth of the national systems were comparable. FDR created 140 national wildlife refuges (especially for birds) and established 29 national forests and 29 national parks and monuments,<ref>Douglas Brinkley, ''Rightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Land of America'' (2016)</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}<ref>Henry L. Henderson and David B. Woolner, eds. ''FDR and the Environment'' (2005).</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}} including [[Everglades National Park]] and [[Olympic National Park]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=379}} His environmental policy can be divided into three major domains. First of all his focus was on a few issues that had long concerned environmentalists: clean air and water, land management, preservation of forest lands, protection of wildlife, conservation of natural resources, and the creation of national parks and monuments.<ref>Byron W. Daynes and Glen Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment: Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush'' (2010) pp 29-35, 44</ref> Second, he created permanent institutional structures with environmental missions, including permanent institutions like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and temporary operations such as the CCC.<ref>Daynes and Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment''  (2010) pp 33-35, 44</ref> Finally, Roosevelt was a superb communicator with the people, and with Congress, using speeches and especially highly publicized  trips visiting key conservation locales.<ref>Daynes and Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment''  (2010) pp 29-33, 44</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's favorite agency, the CCC, expended most of its effort on environmental projects. In the dozen years after its creation, the CCC built 13,000 miles of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles of dirt roads. Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems.<ref>Brinkley, ''Rightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Land of America'' (2016), pp. 170-86.</ref><ref>Neil M.

[http://environmentalhistory.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7-3_Maher.pdf online]</ref> Roosevelt was particularly supportive of water management projects, which could provide [[hydroelectricity]], improve river navigation, and supply water for irrigation. His administration initiated the construction of numerous dams located in the South and the West. Although proposals to replicate the Tennessee Valley Authority in the Pacific Northwest were not acted upon, the administration completed the [[All-American Canal]] and launched the [[Central Valley Project]], both of which irrigated dramatically increased agricultural production in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].  Roosevelt also presided over the establishment of conservation programs and laws such as the Soil Conservation Service, the [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]], and the [[Taylor Grazing Act of 1934]].{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=111\u2013116}}\n\nThroughout his first two terms there was a fierce turf battle over control of the [[United States Forest Service]], which Agriculture Secretary Henry Wallace insisted on keeping, but Interior Secretary Harold Ickes wanted so he could merge it with the [[National Park Service]]. The Brownlow Committee report on administrative management convinced Roosevelt to propose the creation of a new Department of Conservation to replace the Department of the Interior; the new department that would include the Forest Service. For Ickes, the land itself had a higher purpose than mere human usage; Wallace wanted the optimum economic productivity of public lands Both Interior and Agriculture had very strong supporters in Congress, and Roosevelt's plan went nowhere. The status quo triumphed.<ref>Richard Polenberg, \"The Great Conservation Contest.\" ''Forest History'' 10#4 (1967): pp. 13-23.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

It was specifically designed for the poor and staffed largely by women on relief. It was not based on professionalism, nor was it designed by experts. Instead it was premised on the anti-elitist notion that a good teacher does not need paper credentials, that learning does not need a formal classroom and that the highest priority should go to the bottom tier of society. Leaders in the public schools were shocked: they were shut out as consultants and as recipients of New Deal funding. They desperately needed cash to cover the local and state revenues that it disappeared during the depression, they were well organized, and made repeated concerted efforts in 1934, 1937, and 1939, all to no avail. The federal government had a highly professional Office of Education; Roosevelt cut its budget and staff, and refused to consult with its leader [[John Ward Studebaker]].<ref>David Tyack et al. ''Public Schools in Hard times: the Great Depression and Recent Years'' (1984) pp. 93-107.</ref> The CCC programs were deliberately designed not teach skills that would put them in competition with unemployed union members. The CCC did have its own classes. They were voluntary, took place after work, and focused on teaching basic literacy to young men who had quit school before high school.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Adam R. Nelson|author2=John L.

The CWA and FERA focused on hiring unemployed people on relief, and putting them to work on public buildings, including public schools. It built or upgraded 40,000 schools, plus thousands of playgrounds and athletic fields. It gave jobs to 50,000 teachers to keep rural schools open and to teach adult education classes in the cities. It gave a temporary jobs to unemployed teachers in cities like Boston.<ref>Leuchtenburg, p. 121-22.</ref><ref>Tyack et al. ''Public Schools in Hard Times'' pp. 105</ref> Although New Deal leaders refused to give money to impoverished school districts, it did give money to impoverished high school and college students.

In relief programs, they were eligible for jobs only if they were the breadwinner in the family. During the 1930s there was a strong national consensus that in times of job shortages, it was wrong for the government to employ both a husband and his wife.<ref>Ruth Milkman points out that, \"The 1932 federal Economy Act included a 'married persons' clause stipulating that whenever layoffs took place in the executive branch, married persons whose spouses were federal government employees should be the first to go....this nearly always meant firing married women.

In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld a state minimum wage law that was similar to a state law that the court had struck down the year before; the difference between the cases was that Roberts switched his vote. The case was widely seen as an important shift in the Court's judicial philosophy, and one newspaper called Roberts's vote \"[[the switch in time that saved nine]]\" because it effectively ended any chance of passing the court-packing bill. Later in 1937, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the NLRB and the major provisions of the Social Security Act.

Britain and France remained neutral and worked to get the major powers to agree to an arms embargo on both sides. In solidarity with them, Roosevelt recommended to Congress a nondiscriminatory arms embargo in January 1937, and won near-unanimous approval. Though privately supportive of the Republicans, Roosevelt feared the Spanish crisis might escalate to a full-scale European war and cooperated with the other democracies to contain the conflict. He also did not want to alienate American Catholics, a key element of his coalition; Catholic leaders were mostly pro-Franco. By spring 1938, as it was clear that Hitler and Mussolini were aiding Franco, Roosevelt was considering a plan to secretly sell American warplanes to the Spanish government, but nothing came of it. As the Nationalists were achieving victory in early 1939, Roosevelt would refer to the embargo as a mistake.

Most of the aircraft ordered had not arrived in France by the time of its collapse in May 1940, so Roosevelt arranged for French orders to be sold to the British.<ref>Kevin E.

Roosevelt'' (2011), pp 493-516.</ref>\n\n===World War II begins in Europe===\n\n\nWorld War II began in September 1939 with Germany's [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. Western leaders were stunned when the Soviet Union and Germany [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|split control of Poland]]; the two powers had reached [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] in August 1939, which contained a secret protocol for the partition of Poland.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=517\u2013518}} Though few Americans wanted to intervene in the war, an October 1939 Gallup poll showed that over 80 percent of the country favored Britain and France over Germany.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=426\u2013427}} Per the terms of the Neutrality Act, Roosevelt recognized a state of war in Europe, imposing an arms embargo on France, Britain, and Germany. Days later, Roosevelt called Congress into a special session to revise the Neutrality Act. Overcoming the opposition of famous aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] and other isolationists, Roosevelt won passage of the Neutrality Act of 1939, which allowed belligerents to purchase aircraft and other combat material from the United States, albeit only on a cash and carry basis.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=432\u2013434}} Though the United States would remain officially neutral until December 1941, Roosevelt continued to seek ways to assist Britain and France.{{Sfn | Black | 2005 | pp = 503\u20136}} \n\nDuring the so-called \"[[Phony War]],\" a period of inactivity in Europe following the conclusion of the invasion of Poland, Roosevelt tried to negotiate a peace, but Hitler was uninterested in such a possibility.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=435\u2013436}} Japan, meanwhile, grew increasingly assertive in the Pacific, demanding that the French and British colonies close their borders with China.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 568\u2013570}} Beginning in September 1939, Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with [[Winston Churchill]], who became the British prime minister in May 1940.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=442\u2013443}} Germany invaded [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] in April 1940 and invaded the [[Low Countries]] and France in May. As France's situation grew increasingly desperate, Churchill and French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] appealed to Roosevelt for an American entry into the war, but Roosevelt was still unwilling to challenge the isolationist sentiment in the United States.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 548\u2013552}} With France on the verge of surrender, Italy also launched an invasion of France.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=439\u2013440}} France surrendered on June 22, resulting in the division of France into a German-controlled zone and a partially occupied area known [[Vichy France]]. Roosevelt tried to work with Vichy France from 1940 to 1942 to keep it neutral, with scant success.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zahniser | first1 = Marvin R. | year = 1987 | title = The French Connection: Thirty Years of French-American Relations | journal = Reviews in American History | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 486\u2013492 | jstor=2702049| doi = 10.2307/2702049 }}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], Britain and its dominions became the lone major force at war with Germany. Roosevelt, who was determined that Britain not be defeated, took advantage of the rapid shifts of public opinion; the fall of [[Paris]] especially led to a decline in isolationist sentiment.{{Sfn | Leuchtenberg | 1963 | pp = 399\u2013402}} Radio coverage of the [[Battle of Britain]], an aerial campaign in which Germany attempted to air superiority and bombed British targets, further galvanized American public opinion behind Britain.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=523}} Overcoming the opposition of much of the military establishment, who doubted Britain's ability to remain in the war against Germany, Roosevelt pursued policies designed to maximize arms transfers to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=446\u2013450}} In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.<ref>[[#Burns|Burns (1956)]], p. 420.</ref> The military build-up and the British purchase of armaments had a beneficial effect on the economy, and the unemployment rate fell to 14.6 percent in late 1940.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=464}}\n\nOn September 2, 1940, Roosevelt defied the spirit of the Neutrality Acts in reaching the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]. In exchange for the use of British military bases in the Caribbean Islands, the U.S. transferred 50 old World War I American [[destroyer]]s, which were to be used to defend against German submarines.<ref>Richard M. Pious, \"The Historical Presidency: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Destroyer Deal: Normalizing Prerogative Power.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 42#1 (2012): 190-204.</ref> The destroyers themselves held relatively little military importance, but the deal represented a symbolic American commitment to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=453\u2013454}} Later in September 1940, with the backing of both major party presidential candidates, Congress authorized the nation's first ever peacetime draft.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=459\u2013460}} Hitler and Mussolini responded to the Destroyers for Bases Agreement by joining with Japan in the [[Tripartite Pact]], and the three countries became known as the [[Axis powers]].{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | pp = 437-52}} The Tripartite Act was specifically designed to intimidate the United States into remaining neutral in the Sino-Japanese War and the war in Europe.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=505\u2013506}}\n\nAs Roosevelt took a firmer stance against the Axis Powers, American isolationists like Lindbergh and [[America First Committee|America First]] vehemently attacked the president as an irresponsible warmonger. In turn they were denounced as anti-Semitic dupes of the Nazis. Reviewer Richard S. Faulkner paraphrases Lynne Olson in arguing that, \"Lindbergh was far from the simple anti-Semite and pro-Nazi dupe that the Roosevelt administration and pro-intervention press often portrayed him to be, but was rather a man whose technical and clinical mind had him convinced that Britain could not win the war and America\u2019s lack of military preparedness meant that intervention was immoral, illogical, and suicidal.\"<ref>Richard S.

The [[New Deal coalition]], as it became known, made the Democratic Party the majority party in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. The American political system that incorporated the coalition and its opposition is characterized by scholars as the [[Fifth Party System]].<ref>James Ciment, ''Encyclopedia of the Great Depression and the New Deal'' (2001) Vol. 1 p. 6</ref><ref>John M. Allswang, ''New Deal and American Politics'' (1978) and [[Kristi Andersen]], ''The Creation of a Democratic Majority, 1928\u20131936'' (1979), and Everett Carll Ladd Jr., ''Transformations of the American Party System: Political Coalitions from the New Deal to the 1970s'' (2nd ed. 1978) are based on voting statistics and polls.</ref> The New Deal coalition had the most dramatic effect in the North, as the Democrats became competitive throughout the region for the first time since the end of the Civil War.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\n===Northern whites===\nThe impact of the Prohibition issue, the Great Depression, the New Deal and World War II on white ethnic groups (mostly Catholics and Jews) was enormous. Political participation was low among the \"new\" immigrants who arrived after 1890; the established machines did not need their votes. The Depression hit these new immigrants hard, for they had low skill levels and were concentrated in heavy industry. They strongly responded to work relief programs and other aspects of the New Deal, becoming one of the largest and most critical voting blocs in the New Deal coalition. Roosevelt scored large majorities among the main Catholics groups up to 1940. In particular he largely retained the support the Irish, despite Al Smith's repudiation of the New Deal.<ref>Ronald Bayor, ''Neighbors in Conflict: The Irish, Germans, Jews, and Italians of New York City, 1929\u20131941'' (1978)</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nRoosevelt also won over working class Protestant voters and progressive Republicans. Many of these progressives continued to vote for Republican congressional candidates, but others joined the Democratic Party. In western states like North Dakota, progressive voters defected en masse to the Democratic Party and became influential in the state party organization. At the same time, many conservative, rural voters returned to the Republican Party after 1932, diminishing the influence of conservative Northern Democrats.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\n===African American politics===\n{{See also|Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights}}\n\nRoosevelt appointed African Americans to an unprecedented number of political positions; [[William H. Hastie]] became the first African American federal judge. Roosevelt also established an informal \"[[Black Cabinet]]\" to advise him on African-American affairs.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=378}} Roosevelt supported policies designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for non-white workers in the South.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=307\u2013308}} In response to Roosevelt's policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic [[voting bloc]] in several Northern states.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=162\u2013163}} However, Roosevelt needed the support of the powerful white Southern Democrats for his New Deal programs, and blacks were still disenfranchised in most of the South. He decided against pushing for legislation that would make lynching a federal crime; such legislation could not pass over a Southern filibuster and the political fight would threaten his ability to pass his priority programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dubay | first1 = Robert W. | year = 1968 | title = Mississippi and the Proposed Federal Anti-Lynching Bills of 1937\u20131938 | url = | journal = Southern Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 73\u201389}}</ref> He did denounce lynchings as \"a vile form of collective murder,\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Harvard Sitkoff|title=Toward Freedom Land: The Long Struggle for Racial Equality in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K87-4rCCsgoC&pg=PA37|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=37|isbn=978-0813139753}}</ref>\n\n===Labor unions===\n[[File:1936 FDR \"Don't Be Fooled by Figures\" Re-election handbill.jpg|thumb|1936 re-election handbill for Roosevelt promoting his economic policy.]]\n\nRoosevelt at first had massive support from the rapidly growing labor unions; one laborer summed up the feeling of many workers when he stated that, \"Mr. Roosevelt is the only man we ever had in the White House who would understand that my boss is a sonofabitch.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=296\u2013297}} Beginning in the mid-to-late 1930s, labor would suffered from a bitter a split that weakened its political power.

While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community.

Both [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] were attacked for trying to obtain a third non-consecutive term. Roosevelt systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination, including Vice President John Nance Garner<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. | series =[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] | title = The Path to Power | year = 1982 | publisher = [[Alfred A.

Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine, which controlled the auditorium sound system. At the convention the opposition was poorly organized, but Farley had packed the galleries. Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run unless he was drafted, and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone. The delegates were stunned; then the loudspeaker screamed \"We want Roosevelt... The world wants Roosevelt!\" The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot. The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful, as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 428}} At Roosevelt's request, the convention nominated Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace for vice president. Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal, but were unable to prevent his nomination.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=457\u2013458}}\n\nWorld War II shook up the Republican field, possibly preventing the nomination of isolationist congressional leaders like Taft or Vandenberg. The [[1940 Republican National Convention]] instead nominated [[Wendell Willkie]], the first major party nominee since [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] who had never held public office. A well-known corporate attorney and executive, Willkie rose to public notice through his criticism of the New Deal and his clashes with the TVA. Unlike his isolationist rivals for the Republican nomination, Willkie favored Britain in the war, and he was backed by internationalist Republicans like [[Henry Luce]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=455\u2013456}} Willkie's internationalist views initially prevented the issue of foreign policy from dominating the campaign, helping to allow for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and the establishment of a peacetime draft.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=459\u2013460}}\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Willkie and other Republicans stepped up their attacks on Roosevelt's foreign policy. Willkie warned that Roosevelt's re-election would lead to the deployment of U.S. troops abroad. In response, Roosevelt stated that \"Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=462\u2013463}} Roosevelt won the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]] with 55% of the popular vote and almost 85% of the electoral vote (449 to 82).{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 454}} Willkie won ten states: strongly Republican states of Vermont and Maine, and eight isolationist states in the Midwest.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=463\u2013464}} The Democrats retained their congressional majorities, but the conservative coalition largely controlled domestic legislation and remained \"leery of presidential extensions of executive power through social programs.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor=Paul Finkelman |editor2=Peter Wallenstein |title=The encyclopedia of American political history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IYYAAAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=CQ Press|page=332|isbn=9781568025117 }}</ref>\n\nAfter his victory over Willkie, Roosevelt embarked on a public campaign to win congressional support for aid to the British.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} In December 1940, Roosevelt received a letter from Churchill asking the U.S. to repeal the cash and carry provision of the Neutrality Act. With British forces committed to defending against Germany, Churchill asked for the United States to provide loans and shipping for American goods.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=467\u2013468}} In response, Roosevelt delivered a speech in which he called for the United States to serve as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]],\" supplying aid to those resisting Germany and other aggressors.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=524\u2013525}} He stated, \"if Great Britain goes down, the Axis Powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas\u2013and they will be in a position to bring enormous military military and naval resources against this hemisphere.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=401\u2013402}} In his January 1941 [[Four Freedoms]] speech, Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=487\u2013488}} In that same speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to approve a [[Lend-Lease]] program designed to provide military aid to Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|pp=469\u2013470}} Roosevelt's [[Presidency of Franklin D.

While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as \"[[direct development]]\"), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolus organisms, of a [[pupa]]l or resting stage between the [[larval]] and adult forms.\n\n=== Development and terminology ===\n[[File:Holometabolous vs. Hemimetabolous.svg|thumb|Two types of metamorphosis are shown. In a complete (holometabolous) metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an adult that does not resemble the larva. In an incomplete (hemimetabolous) metamorphosis an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.]]\nIn [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] [[insects]], immature stages are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]].  Development proceeds in repeated stages of growth and [[ecdysis]] (moulting); these stages are called [[instar]]s. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just differences in body proportions and the number of segments; in later instars, external wing buds form.\n\nIn [[holometabolous]] insects, immature stages are called [[larva]]e and differ markedly from  adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism pass through a larval stage, then enter an inactive state called [[pupa]] (called a [[pupa#Chrysalis|\"chrysalis]]\" in butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.<ref name=\"Lowe\">{{cite journal |first=Tristan |last=Lowe |first2=Russell P. |last2=Garwood |first3=Thomas |last3=Simonsen |first4=Robert S. |last4=Bradley |first5=Philip J. |last5=Withers |date=July 6, 2013 |volume=10 |issue=84 |at=20130304 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0304|pmid=23676900 |pmc=3673169 |title=Metamorphosis revealed: Time-lapse three-dimensional imaging inside a living chrysalis |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface }}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution ===\nThe earliest insect forms showed direct development ([[ametabolism]]), and the evolution of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2).

[[Hemimetabolism|Hemimetabolous]] insects include [[cockroach]]es, [[grasshopper]]s, [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and [[Hemiptera|true bugs]]. Phylogenetically, all insects in the [[Pterygota]] undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult.

Fish metamorphosis is typically under strong control by the thyroid hormone.<ref name=\"Laudet\" />\n\nExamples among the non-bony fish include the [[lamprey]]. Among the bony fish, mechanisms are varied.\n\nThe [[salmon]] is [[diadromous]], meaning that it changes from a [[freshwater]] to a [[Seawater|saltwater]] lifestyle.\n\nMany species of [[flatfish]] begin their life [[bilaterally symmetrical]], with an eye on either side of the body; but one eye moves to join the other side of the fish \u2013 which becomes the upper side \u2013 in the adult form.\n\nThe [[European eel]] has a number of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the [[leptocephalus]] stage, then a quick metamorphosis to glass eel at the edge of the continental shelf (eight days for the [[Japanese eel]]), two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick metamorphosis into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult [[Fresh water|freshwater]] stage, the eel also has [[phenotypic plasticity]] because fish-eating eels develop very wide mandibles, making the head look blunt. [[Leptocephalus|Leptocephali]] are common, occurring in all [[Elopomorpha]] ([[tarpon]]- and [[eel]]-like fish).\n\nMost other bony fish undergo metamorphosis from embryo to larva ([[Fry (biology)|fry]]) and then to the juvenile stage during absorption of the yolk sac, because after that phase the individual needs to be able to feed for itself.<ref>Mader, Sylvia, ''Biology'' 9th ed. Ch. 31</ref><ref>Peter B. Moyle and Joseph J. Cech Jr, ''Fishes: an introduction to ichthyology'' 5th ed. 9.3: \"Development\" pp 148ff</ref>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n[[File:RanaTemporariaLarva2.jpg|thumb|Just before metamorphosis, only 24 hours are needed to reach the stage in the next picture.]]\n[[File:Rana Temporaria - Larva Final Stage.jpg|thumb|Almost functional [[common frog]] with some remains of the gill sac and a not fully developed jaw]]\n\nIn typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and  larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. [[Frogs]], [[toads]], and [[newts]] all hatch from the eggs as larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amphibians to interact outside with pulmonary respiration. Afterwards, newt larvae  start a predatory lifestyle, while [[tadpole]]s mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.\n\nMetamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxin]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts its effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, development is subject to many adaptations due to specific ecological circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges for teeth, whiskers, and fins. They also make use of the [[lateral line]] organ. After  metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be resorbed by controlled cell death, called [[apoptosis]]. The amount of adaptation to specific ecological circumstances is remarkable, with many discoveries still being made.\n\n==== Frogs and toads ====\nWith frogs and toads, the  external gills of the newly hatched tadpole are covered with a gill sac after a few days, and lungs are quickly formed. Front legs are formed under the gill sac, and hindlegs are visible a few days later. Following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tadpole lives off a vegetarian diet. Tadpoles use a relatively long, spiral\u2010shaped gut to digest that diet.\n\nRapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral\u2010shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow  quickly, a tongue is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system, etc.) All  this can happen in about a day, so it is truly a metamorphosis. It is not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Salamanders ====\nThe Salamander development is highly diverse; some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults, while others, such as the [[axolotl]], display [[Neoteny|paedomorphosis]] and never develop into terrestrial adults. Within the genus ''[[Ambystoma]]'', species have evolved to be paedomorphic several times, and paedomorphosis and complete development can both occur in some species.<ref name=\"Laudet\">{{cite journal | last1 = Laudet | first1 = Vincent | date = September 27, 2011 | title = The Origins and Evolution of Vertebrate Metamorphosis | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 18| pages = R726\u2013R737 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.07.030| pmid = 21959163 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==== Newts ====\n[[File:LarveKamsalamander.JPG|thumb|The large external gills of the [[crested newt]]]]\n\nIn newts, there is no true metamorphosis {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts' gills are never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal leaves the water. Just as in tadpoles, their lungs are functional early, but newts use them less frequently than tadpoles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Newts often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, [[prolactin]] is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, [[thyroxin]]. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.\n\n==== Caecilians ====\nBasal caecilians such as ''[[Ichthyophis]]'' go through a metamorphosis in which aquatic larva transition into fossorial adults, which involves a loss of the [[lateral line]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dunker | first1 = Nicole | last2 = Wake | first2 = Marvalee H. | last3 = Olson | first3 = Wendy M. | date = January 2000 | title = Embryonic and Larval Development in the Caecilian Ichthyophis kohtaoensis (Amphibia, Gymnophiona): A Staging Table | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 243 | issue = 1| pages = 3\u201334 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4687(200001)243:1<3::aid-jmor2>3.3.co;2-4| pmid = 10629095 }}</ref> More recently diverged caecilians (the [[Teresomata]]) do not undergo an ontogenetic niche shift of this sort and are in general fossorial throughout their lives.

Chapter 3.</ref>\nPTTH also stimulates the [[corpora allata]], a retrocerebral organ, to produce [[juvenile hormone]], which prevents the development of adult characteristics during [[ecdysis]].

While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as \"[[direct development]]\"), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolus organisms, of a [[pupa]]l or resting stage between the [[larval]] and adult forms.\n\n=== Development and terminology ===\n[[File:Holometabolous vs. Hemimetabolous.svg|thumb|Two types of metamorphosis are shown. In a complete (holometabolous) metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an adult that does not resemble the larva. In an incomplete (hemimetabolous) metamorphosis an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.]]\nIn [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] [[insects]], immature stages are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]].  Development proceeds in repeated stages of growth and [[ecdysis]] (moulting); these stages are called [[instar]]s. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just differences in body proportions and the number of segments; in later instars, external wing buds form.\n\nIn [[holometabolous]] insects, immature stages are called [[larva]]e and differ markedly from  adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism pass through a larval stage, then enter an inactive state called [[pupa]] (called a [[pupa#Chrysalis|\"chrysalis]]\" in butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.<ref name=\"Lowe\">{{cite journal |first=Tristan |last=Lowe |first2=Russell P. |last2=Garwood |first3=Thomas |last3=Simonsen |first4=Robert S. |last4=Bradley |first5=Philip J. |last5=Withers |date=July 6, 2013 |volume=10 |issue=84 |at=20130304 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0304|pmid=23676900 |pmc=3673169 |title=Metamorphosis revealed: Time-lapse three-dimensional imaging inside a living chrysalis |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface }}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution ===\nThe earliest insect forms showed direct development ([[ametabolism]]), and the evolution of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2).

[[Hemimetabolism|Hemimetabolous]] insects include [[cockroach]]es, [[grasshopper]]s, [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and [[Hemiptera|true bugs]]. Phylogenetically, all insects in the [[Pterygota]] undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult.

Fish metamorphosis is typically under strong control by the thyroid hormone.<ref name=\"Laudet\" />\n\nExamples among the non-bony fish include the [[lamprey]]. Among the bony fish, mechanisms are varied.\n\nThe [[salmon]] is [[diadromous]], meaning that it changes from a [[freshwater]] to a [[Seawater|saltwater]] lifestyle.\n\nMany species of [[flatfish]] begin their life [[bilaterally symmetrical]], with an eye on either side of the body; but one eye moves to join the other side of the fish \u2013 which becomes the upper side \u2013 in the adult form.\n\nThe [[European eel]] has a number of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the [[leptocephalus]] stage, then a quick metamorphosis to glass eel at the edge of the continental shelf (eight days for the [[Japanese eel]]), two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick metamorphosis into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult [[Fresh water|freshwater]] stage, the eel also has [[phenotypic plasticity]] because fish-eating eels develop very wide mandibles, making the head look blunt. [[Leptocephalus|Leptocephali]] are common, occurring in all [[Elopomorpha]] ([[tarpon]]- and [[eel]]-like fish).\n\nMost other bony fish undergo metamorphosis from embryo to larva ([[Fry (biology)|fry]]) and then to the juvenile stage during absorption of the yolk sac, because after that phase the individual needs to be able to feed for itself.<ref>Mader, Sylvia, ''Biology'' 9th ed. Ch. 31</ref><ref>Peter B. Moyle and Joseph J. Cech Jr, ''Fishes: an introduction to ichthyology'' 5th ed. 9.3: \"Development\" pp 148ff</ref>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n[[File:RanaTemporariaLarva2.jpg|thumb|Just before metamorphosis, only 24 hours are needed to reach the stage in the next picture.]]\n[[File:Rana Temporaria - Larva Final Stage.jpg|thumb|Almost functional [[common frog]] with some remains of the gill sac and a not fully developed jaw]]\n\nIn typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and  larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. [[Frogs]], [[toads]], and [[newts]] all hatch from the eggs as larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amphibians to interact outside with pulmonary respiration. Afterwards, newt larvae  start a predatory lifestyle, while [[tadpole]]s mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.\n\nMetamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxin]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts its effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, development is subject to many adaptations due to specific ecological circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges for teeth, whiskers, and fins. They also make use of the [[lateral line]] organ. After  metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be resorbed by controlled cell death, called [[apoptosis]]. The amount of adaptation to specific ecological circumstances is remarkable, with many discoveries still being made.\n\n==== Frogs and toads ====\nWith frogs and toads, the  external gills of the newly hatched tadpole are covered with a gill sac after a few days, and lungs are quickly formed. Front legs are formed under the gill sac, and hindlegs are visible a few days later. Following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tadpole lives off a vegetarian diet. Tadpoles use a relatively long, spiral\u2010shaped gut to digest that diet.\n\nRapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral\u2010shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow  quickly, a tongue is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system, etc.) All  this can happen in about a day, so it is truly a metamorphosis. It is not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Salamanders ====\nThe Salamander development is highly diverse; some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults, while others, such as the [[axolotl]], display [[Neoteny|paedomorphosis]] and never develop into terrestrial adults. Within the genus ''[[Ambystoma]]'', species have evolved to be paedomorphic several times, and paedomorphosis and complete development can both occur in some species.<ref name=\"Laudet\">{{cite journal | last1 = Laudet | first1 = Vincent | date = September 27, 2011 | title = The Origins and Evolution of Vertebrate Metamorphosis | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 18| pages = R726\u2013R737 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.07.030| pmid = 21959163 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==== Newts ====\n[[File:LarveKamsalamander.JPG|thumb|The large external gills of the [[crested newt]]]]\n\nIn newts, there is no true metamorphosis {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts' gills are never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal leaves the water. Just as in tadpoles, their lungs are functional early, but newts use them less frequently than tadpoles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Newts often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, [[prolactin]] is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, [[thyroxin]]. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.\n\n==== Caecilians ====\nBasal caecilians such as ''[[Ichthyophis]]'' go through a metamorphosis in which aquatic larva transition into fossorial adults, which involves a loss of the [[lateral line]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dunker | first1 = Nicole | last2 = Wake | first2 = Marvalee H. | last3 = Olson | first3 = Wendy M. | date = January 2000 | title = Embryonic and Larval Development in the Caecilian Ichthyophis kohtaoensis (Amphibia, Gymnophiona): A Staging Table | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 243 | issue = 1| pages = 3\u201334 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4687(200001)243:1<3::aid-jmor2>3.3.co;2-4| pmid = 10629095 }}</ref> More recently diverged caecilians (the [[Teresomata]]) do not undergo an ontogenetic niche shift of this sort and are in general fossorial throughout their lives.
