The party had representation in the senate, from 1977 through to 2007, frequently holding the balance of power in that time. Formed by [[Don Chipp]], on a promise to \u201cKeep the Bastards Honest,\u201d it was known to have represented the \u201cmiddle ground.\u201d  The party regained registration in 2019.\n\nIn addition, there are a number of smaller groups that have formed in response to the bipartisan system who uphold centrist ideals. South Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] had launched his own centrist political party called the [[Nick Xenophon Team]] (NXT) in 2014, renamed [[Centre Alliance]] in 2018.\n\n=== Belgium ===\nThe traditional centrist party of [[Flanders]] was the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] which embraced [[social liberalism]] and aimed to represent Dutch-speaking Belgians who felt culturally suppressed by Francophones. The [[New Flemish Alliance]] is the largest and since 2009 the only extant successor of that party. It is, however, primarily composed of the right wing of the former People's Union, and has adopted a more [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] ideology in recent years.\n\nAmong French speaking Belgians the [[Centre d\u00e9mocrate humaniste|Humanist Democratic Centre]] is a centre-right or centre party as it is considerably less [[conservatism|conservative]] than its Flemish counterpart, [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic & Flemish]].\n\nAnother party in the centre of the political spectrum is the liberal [[Mouvement R\u00e9formateur|Reformist Movement]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThere are several centrist parties in Brazil, such as the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB), which is a [[Big tent|catch-all party]], one of the largest political parties in Brazil.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) is also another example of a centrist party in Brazilian politics, though it was supported by right-wing political parties from [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002]], [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006]], pros [[2010 Brazilian general election|2010]] and [[2014 Brazilian general election|2014]] elections.\n\nAnd they have others like [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB), [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil)]] (PSD), [[Avante (political party)|Avante]] (AVANTE), [[Podemos (Brazil)|PODEMOS]] (PODE) and [[Republican Party of the Social Order]] (PROS)\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{see|Politics of Canada#Political culture}}\nThroughout modern history [[Canadian government]]s at the federal level have governed from a [[moderate]], centrist political position,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Amanda Bittner|author2=Royce Koop|title=Parties, Elections, and the Future of Canadian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TdFTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA300|date=1 March 2013|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2411-8|page=300|quote=Domination by the Centre The central anomaly of the Canadian system, and the primary cause of its other peculiarities, has been its historical domination by a party of the centre.

Agrarian [[Croatian Peasant Party]] during last years became moderate and centrist, having been centre-right in the past.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nThe [[Czech Republic]] has a number of prominent centrist parties, including the [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] [[populist]] movement [[ANO 2011]] (currently in government), the [[civil libertarian]] [[Czech Pirate Party]], the long-standing [[Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak People's Party]] and the [[localist]] party [[Mayors and Independents]].\n\n=== Estonia ===\n{{main|Centrism in Estonia}}\n\n=== France ===\nFrance has a tradition of parties that call themselves \"''centriste''\", though the actual parties vary over time: when a new political issue emerges and a new political party breaks into the mainstream, the old centre-left party may be de facto pushed rightwards, but unable to consider itself a party of the right, it will embrace being the new centre: this process occurred with the [[Orl\u00e9anism]], [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate R\u00e9publicanism]], [[Independent Radicals|Radical Republicanism]] and [[Radical-Socialism]].\n\nCurrently the most notable centrist party is [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!|La R\u00e9publique en marche !]], founded by [[Emmanuel Macron]]; who was elected as [[President of France]] in May 2017.\n\nAnother party is the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] of [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]], founded in 2007. However, the centrist parties often oppose the left-wing parties such as [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]] and [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]]. It often support the centre-right [[Gaullist]] parties and have joined several coalitions governed by Presidents [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:2010-11-29 JoachimGauck 211.JPG|thumb|In 1990, [[Joachim Gauck]] (who is a former German President, centrist politician and activist without party affiliation) took part in the [[Alliance 90]], having become an independent after [[Alliance 90/The Greens|its merger with The Greens]]]]\n''Zentrismus'' is a term only known to experts, as it is easily confused with ''Zentralismus'' (\"centralism\", the opposite to decentralisation/federalism), so the usual term in German for the political centre/centrism is ''politische Mitte'' (literally \"political middle\", or \"political centre\"). Historically, the German party with the most purely centrist nature among German parties to have had current or historical parliamentary representations was most likely the [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933).\n\nThere existed during the Weimar Republic (and again after the Nazi period) a ''[[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]'', a party of German [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] founded in 1870. It was called Centre Party not for being a proper centrist party, but because it united left-wing and right-wing Catholics, because it was the first German party to be a ''Volkspartei'' ([[big tent|catch-all party]]) and because his elected representatives sat between the liberals (the left of the time) and the conservatives (the right of the time). However, it was distinctly right-wing conservative in that it was not neutral on religious issues (such as on secular education), being markedly against more liberal and modernist positions.\n\nThe main successor of ''Zentrum'' after the return of democracy to West Germany in 1945, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], has throughout its history alternated between describing itself as right-wing or centrist and sitting on the right-wing (with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in its social liberal moments sitting at its left, in the centre and themselves sitting at the centre, with the FDP in its [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] moments sitting at its right, in the right-wing). The representatives of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], although they have since the 1990s many times referred to themselves as \"the new middle\" (under influence of the [[Third way (centrism)|Third way]] of the time), feel less at ease in describing their party as centrist due to their history and socialist identity.\n\n[[Alliance '90/The Greens]] was founded in 1993 as a merger from the East German [[Alliance 90]] (a group of centrist/[[transpartisan|transversalist]] civil rights activists) and the (West) German Greens. The latter was a coalition of various unorthodox-left politicians and more liberal \"realists\". This [[Bundestag]] party also hesitates in using the term centre, although it does distance itself as well from the tag of left, which identifies it for the moment as a transversalist party. The transversalist moderation of the party and its position in the Bundestag between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats (while the FDP has its seats at the right of the Christian Democrats) also points somewhat to The Greens being a more or less centrist party.\n\nIn the state parliaments of specific German states there are other specifically regional parties which could be identified as centrist. The [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]], of the Danish and Frisian minorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] has currently a centrist political position, although in the past the party usually leaned to the left. In the German presidential elections of [[2009 German presidential election|2009]], [[2010 German presidential election|2010]] and [[2012 German presidential election|2012]], it supported the candidates of the Social Democrats and the Greens. In Bavaria, the [[Free Voters]] party present at the state parliament may also be seen as a centrist party.\n\n=== Greece ===\nIn Greece centrism has its roots to centrist politician and founder of [[Agricultural Party of Greece|Agricultural]] and [[Labor Party of Greece|Labour]] Party, [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]. In 1961, [[Georgios Papandreou]] created along with other political leaders the coalition party of [[Centre Union]]. Five parties were merged: Liberal Party, Progressive Agricultural Democratic Union, National Progressive Center Union, Popular Social Party into one, with strong centrist agenda opposed equally to right wing party of National Radical Union and left wing party of United Democratic Left. The Centre Union Party was the last Venizelist party to hold power in Greece. The party nominally continued to exist until 1977 (after the Junta it was known as the [[Centre Union \u2013 New Forces|Center Union \u2013 New Forces]]), when its successor Union of the Democratic Centre (EDIK) party was created.\n\n[[Union of Centrists]] was created by [[Vassilis Leventis]] in 1992 under the title \"Union of Centrists and Ecologists\", though the name was changed shortly after. The Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Center Union. The party strives to become \"the political continuance of the centrist expression in Greece\". Leventis aimed to become part of the Venizelist legacy of some great politicians of the past, such as Eleftherios Venizelos and George Papandreou Sr. However, the party's total influence had been marginal until 2015, with 1.79% of the total votes (in the [[January 2015 Greek legislative election]]) being its highest achievement before finally making its way to the [[Greek Parliament]] in September 2015 with 3.43% of the total votes and 9 members elected.\n\n=== India ===\nThe National People's Party is a national-level political party in India, though its influence is mostly concentrated in the state of Meghalaya. The party was founded by P A Sangma after his expulsion from the NCP in July 2012. It was accorded national party status on 7 June 2019. It is the first political party from Northeastern India to have attained this status.\nActor turned politician [[Kamal Haasan]] has launched a party named [[Makkal Needhi Maiam]] meaning People's Centre for Justice.\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], both two main political parties ([[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]]) claim the political centre ground, but seem to lean to the centre-right and be mostly made up of centre-right members.<ref name=\"iran-daily.com\">[http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 Iran Daily \u2013 Dot Coms \u2013 05-31-07, Bertie's Challenge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018012627/http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 |date=18 October 2007 }}, 5th paragraph</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=John Murray |title=Irish Poll Hits Fianna Fail |url=https://www.ft.com/content/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658 |accessdate=2019-11-28 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=13 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525190855/https://www.ft.com/content/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658 |archivedate=2017-05-25}}</ref> The two parties have shared broadly similar policies in the past, with their primary division being perceived as being steeped in [[Irish Civil War]] politics.

From them, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) tend to be [[centre-right]] whilst the social liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) are more centrist.<ref>[http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf Politieke Barometer: ''D66 middenpartij bij uitstek''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719123931/http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf |date=19 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant]] [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] is a small [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] party that has transversalist positions less typical in European centrist parties. Whilst it is left-leaning on issues such as immigration, welfare and the environment, it is more conservative on social issues, such as [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[euthanasia]]. They have participated in several coalitions due to their moderate centrist politics.\n\n[[Livable Netherlands]] was originally a centrist political movement of local grass-root parties with an anti-establishment touch similar to early D66. However, the party entered in 2002 national parliament with a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] programme based [[Law and order (politics)|on security]] and immigration as the major issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, there were two self-described \"centre\" parties, the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] and the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] who at some point were represented in [[Tweede Kamer|Dutch parliament]]. However these parties were considered as [[far right]] (in the case of the Centre Democrats) or even [[extreme right]] (in the case of the Centre Party) in their opinion about foreign immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/nl/Educatie/monitor/Kronieken/Kroniek-extreemrechts/De-Centrumstroming/De-Centrumpartij/|title=Kroniek extreemrechts: De Centrumpartij|first=Anne Frank|last=Stichting|date=20 January 2011|website=annefrank.org}}</ref> Both parties denied being racist or extremist in character. The party slogan of the Center Party was ''\"niet rechts, niet links\"'' (\"Neither rightist nor leftist\"), and in some respect could be seen as a centrist (or more correctly [[Third Position]]) party since it borrowed ideas from the political (far) right (a tough stand on immigration combined with typical racial prejudice) and the political left ([[mixed economy]], green politics). However both of these two parties didn't really have a coherent ideology; they were basically one-issue parties focussed on what the perceived as mass immigration from non-European countries.\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\n[[File:Senterpartiet campaining Norwegian Storting elections 2005 Picture from N\u00e6rb\u00f8 at J\u00e6ren.JPG|thumb|Campaign for the Norwegian [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] at [[N\u00e6rb\u00f8]]: like its [[Centre Party (Finland)|Finnish]] and [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Swedish]] counterparts, the party has a strong focus on decentralisation, rural and agrarian issues]]\n{{main|Nordic agrarian parties}}\n{{see also|Centrism in Finland|Centrism in Iceland|Centrism in Sweden}}\nIn most of the [[Nordic countries]], there are [[Nordic agrarian parties]]. These share in addition to the centrist position on the socio-economic left-right scale a clear, separate ideology.\n\nThis position is centred on [[decentralisation]], a commitment to [[small business]] and [[environmentalism|environmental protection]]. Centrists have aligned themselves with the [[Liberal International]] and [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]. Historically, all of these parties were farmers' parties committed to maintaining rural life. In the 1960s, these parties broadened their scope to include non-farmer-related issues and renamed themselves [[Centre Party (disambiguation)|Centre Party]].\n\nNeither the [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] (a now defunct centrist political party) nor the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] (a political party founded as a centrist social liberal party, but that now is a classical liberal party), both of Denmark, are rooted in centrist agrarianism.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\n[[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI), founded by [[Imran Khan]], claims to be a centrist political party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/06/28/survey-imran-khan-most-popular-leader-of-pakistan/|title=Survey: Imran Khan most popular leader of Pakistan|first=Mirza|last=Hassan|date=28 June 2012|work=TheNewsTribe.com|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> Following the [[2013 Pakistani general election|general election of 2013]], PTI emerged as the second-largest political party in Pakistan by number of votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.com.pk/|title=elections.com.pk|access-date=4 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064535/http://elections.com.pk/|archivedate=5 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In July 2018 it won the general elections of Pakistan and [[Imran Khan]], its chairman, became Prime Minister.<ref name=\"PTI_2018Election\">{{cite web |last1=Saifi |first1=Sophia |last2=Raja |first2=Adeel |last3=Dewan |first3=Angela |title=Imran Khan's party wins Pakistan election but falls short of majority |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/28/asia/pakistan-election-results-imran-khan-intl/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Palestine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe [[Third Way (Palestinian authority)|Third Way]] is a small centrist Palestinian political party active in Palestinian politics. Founded on 16 December 2005, the party is led by [[Salam Fayyad]] and [[Hanan Ashrawi]].\n\nIn the January 2006 PLC elections, it received 2.41% of the popular vote and won two of the Council's 132 seats. The party presents itself as an alternative to the two-party system of [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]].\n\n=== Poland ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Civic Platform]] (PO), ruling in 2007\u20132015, began in 2001 as a liberal conservative party, but later under the leadership of [[Donald Tusk]] turned into typical centrist in order to attract left-leading liberal voters. Depending on the context, it is described as either Christian Democratic (it is a member of [[European People's Party]]), conservative, liberal, or social. Its pragmatism, technocracy and lack of ideology have been nevertheless criticized and currently, under the new leader [[Grzegorz Schetyna]] announced that it is returning to the right, but as part of [[Civic Coalition (Poland)|Civic Coalition]] it turns to progressivism again. Other political groups like [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL) may be described as centrist too (in Poland, national-moral right-wing [[Law and Justice]] is [[social conservative]], usually at the same time economical left and favor [[protectionism]] policies).\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe only national party that defends itself as a centrist party is [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], whose platform is been increasingly perceived as right-wing by the Spanish citizens as the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas]] surveys show. In April 2018 Ciudadanos obtained a 6,77, when ranging political parties from 1 to 10, where 1 was farthest left and 10 its equivalent in the right.<ref>[http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/3200_3219/3210/es3210mar.pdf] Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas. 27 July 2018</ref> It first entered the [[Cortes Generales]] in 2015.\n\nIn Catalonia, where the party was born, many people even consider it as an extreme right-wing party, considering its fierce \"opposition to nationalism\".

The new New Labour era is seen as ending when Blair's successor [[Gordon Brown]] lost the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] to the Conservatives. Brown's successor as leader, [[Ed Miliband]], moved the party (slightly) to the left of New Labour era position. Miliband set out his stall to \"redefine the political centre\", with pundits declaring New Labour \"dead\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e9c342ac-c954-11df-b3d6-00144feab49a|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Miliband declares New Labour dead|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=8 August 2018|last=Barker|first=Alex}}</ref> The [[Blue Labour]] movement, launched in 2009, attempted to cultivate a new path for Labour centrism that would appeal to socially conservative working class periods, and was a mild influence on Labour during Miliband's tenure. The party later moved decisively to the left when the socialist [[Jeremy Corbyn]] became leader in 2015, as a result of the introduction of a [[one member one vote]] system under Miliband.\n\nIn March 2011, [[Nick Clegg]], the-then leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], stated that he believed that his party belonged to the radical centre, mentioning [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[William Beveridge]], [[Jo Grimond]], [[David Lloyd George]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] as examples of the radical centre that preceded the Liberal Democrats' establishment in 1988. He pointed to liberalism as an ideology of people and described the political spectrum and his party's position as follows: \"For the left, an obsession with the state. For the right, a worship of the market. But as liberals, we place our faith in people. People with power and opportunity in their hands. Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre\".\n\nIn the 2000s, [[David Cameron]] also moved the Conservative Party towards the centre, allowing his party to be [[2010 United Kingdom general election|elected in 2010]] in a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition with the Liberal Democrats]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]], the Conservatives gained a majority and the Liberal Democrats lost most of their seats. They regained a small number of seats in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 election]]. Cameron's successor [[Theresa May]] used left-wing rhetoric on her appointment as Prime Minister, stating her wish to tackle social inequality, and adopted some of Ed Miliband's policies; for example, on regulating energy companies. However, the party's 2017 manifesto was seen as sharp break from the centre ground, appealing to traditionally Tory heartland issues in the aftermath of the UK's [[Brexit referendum]].\n\nFollowing the [[Brexit referendum]], politics in the UK was seen as having reverted to traditionally polarised \"left and right\" politics. For the 2017 election, the group [[More United]] was set up in the vein of the US [[Super PAC]] model to support candidates from multiple parties who meet its values; it gave support primarily to Labour and Lib Dem MPs, as well as one Conservative. In April 2018, ''The Observer'' newspaper reported that a group setup by Simon Franks had amassed \u00a350 million to start a new centrist political party in the UK to field candidates at the next general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/07/new-political-party-break-mould-westminster-uk-brexit|title=New centrist party gets \u00a350m backing to 'break mould' of UK politics|first=Michael|last=Savage|date=8 April 2018|website=the Guardian}}</ref> It has reportedly been named [[United for Change]].\n\nIn early 2019, difficulties and party clashes regarding Brexit caused a number of Labour and Conservative MPs to leave their parties, forming a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] group named [[The Independent Group]].

The [[New Flemish Alliance]] is the largest and since 2009 the only extant successor of that party.

Agrarian [[Croatian Peasant Party]] during last years became moderate and centrist, having been centre-right in the past.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nThe [[Czech Republic]] has a number of prominent centrist parties, including the [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] [[populist]] movement [[ANO 2011]] (currently in government), the [[civil libertarian]] [[Czech Pirate Party]], the long-standing [[Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak People's Party]] and the [[localist]] party [[Mayors and Independents]].\n\n=== Estonia ===\n{{main|Centrism in Estonia}}\n\n=== France ===\nFrance has a tradition of parties that call themselves \"''centriste''\", though the actual parties vary over time: when a new political issue emerges and a new political party breaks into the mainstream, the old centre-left party may be de facto pushed rightwards, but unable to consider itself a party of the right, it will embrace being the new centre: this process occurred with the [[Orl\u00e9anism]], [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate R\u00e9publicanism]], [[Independent Radicals|Radical Republicanism]] and [[Radical-Socialism]].\n\nCurrently the most notable centrist party is [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!|La R\u00e9publique en marche !]], founded by [[Emmanuel Macron]]; who was elected as [[President of France]] in May 2017.\n\nAnother party is the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] of [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]], founded in 2007. However, the centrist parties often oppose the left-wing parties such as [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]] and [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]]. It often support the centre-right [[Gaullist]] parties and have joined several coalitions governed by Presidents [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:2010-11-29 JoachimGauck 211.JPG|thumb|In 1990, [[Joachim Gauck]] (who is a former German President, centrist politician and activist without party affiliation) took part in the [[Alliance 90]], having become an independent after [[Alliance 90/The Greens|its merger with The Greens]]]]\n''Zentrismus'' is a term only known to experts, as it is easily confused with ''Zentralismus'' (\"centralism\", the opposite to decentralisation/federalism), so the usual term in German for the political centre/centrism is ''politische Mitte'' (literally \"political middle\", or \"political centre\"). Historically, the German party with the most purely centrist nature among German parties to have had current or historical parliamentary representations was most likely the [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933).\n\nThere existed during the Weimar Republic (and again after the Nazi period) a ''[[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]'', a party of German [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] founded in 1870. It was called Centre Party not for being a proper centrist party, but because it united left-wing and right-wing Catholics, because it was the first German party to be a ''Volkspartei'' ([[big tent|catch-all party]]) and because his elected representatives sat between the liberals (the left of the time) and the conservatives (the right of the time). However, it was distinctly right-wing conservative in that it was not neutral on religious issues (such as on secular education), being markedly against more liberal and modernist positions.\n\nThe main successor of ''Zentrum'' after the return of democracy to West Germany in 1945, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], has throughout its history alternated between describing itself as right-wing or centrist and sitting on the right-wing (with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in its social liberal moments sitting at its left, in the centre and themselves sitting at the centre, with the FDP in its [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] moments sitting at its right, in the right-wing). The representatives of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], although they have since the 1990s many times referred to themselves as \"the new middle\" (under influence of the [[Third way (centrism)|Third way]] of the time), feel less at ease in describing their party as centrist due to their history and socialist identity.\n\n[[Alliance '90/The Greens]] was founded in 1993 as a merger from the East German [[Alliance 90]] (a group of centrist/[[transpartisan|transversalist]] civil rights activists) and the (West) German Greens. The latter was a coalition of various unorthodox-left politicians and more liberal \"realists\". This [[Bundestag]] party also hesitates in using the term centre, although it does distance itself as well from the tag of left, which identifies it for the moment as a transversalist party. The transversalist moderation of the party and its position in the Bundestag between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats (while the FDP has its seats at the right of the Christian Democrats) also points somewhat to The Greens being a more or less centrist party.\n\nIn the state parliaments of specific German states there are other specifically regional parties which could be identified as centrist. The [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]], of the Danish and Frisian minorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] has currently a centrist political position, although in the past the party usually leaned to the left. In the German presidential elections of [[2009 German presidential election|2009]], [[2010 German presidential election|2010]] and [[2012 German presidential election|2012]], it supported the candidates of the Social Democrats and the Greens. In Bavaria, the [[Free Voters]] party present at the state parliament may also be seen as a centrist party.\n\n=== Greece ===\nIn Greece centrism has its roots to centrist politician and founder of [[Agricultural Party of Greece|Agricultural]] and [[Labor Party of Greece|Labour]] Party, [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]. In 1961, [[Georgios Papandreou]] created along with other political leaders the coalition party of [[Centre Union]]. Five parties were merged: Liberal Party, Progressive Agricultural Democratic Union, National Progressive Center Union, Popular Social Party into one, with strong centrist agenda opposed equally to right wing party of National Radical Union and left wing party of United Democratic Left. The Centre Union Party was the last Venizelist party to hold power in Greece. The party nominally continued to exist until 1977 (after the Junta it was known as the [[Centre Union \u2013 New Forces|Center Union \u2013 New Forces]]), when its successor Union of the Democratic Centre (EDIK) party was created.\n\n[[Union of Centrists]] was created by [[Vassilis Leventis]] in 1992 under the title \"Union of Centrists and Ecologists\", though the name was changed shortly after. The Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Center Union. The party strives to become \"the political continuance of the centrist expression in Greece\". Leventis aimed to become part of the Venizelist legacy of some great politicians of the past, such as Eleftherios Venizelos and George Papandreou Sr. However, the party's total influence had been marginal until 2015, with 1.79% of the total votes (in the [[January 2015 Greek legislative election]]) being its highest achievement before finally making its way to the [[Greek Parliament]] in September 2015 with 3.43% of the total votes and 9 members elected.\n\n=== India ===\nThe National People's Party is a national-level political party in India, though its influence is mostly concentrated in the state of Meghalaya. The party was founded by P A Sangma after his expulsion from the NCP in July 2012. It was accorded national party status on 7 June 2019. It is the first political party from Northeastern India to have attained this status.\nActor turned politician [[Kamal Haasan]] has launched a party named [[Makkal Needhi Maiam]] meaning People's Centre for Justice.\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], both two main political parties ([[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]]) claim the political centre ground, but seem to lean to the centre-right and be mostly made up of centre-right members.<ref name=\"iran-daily.com\">[http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 Iran Daily \u2013 Dot Coms \u2013 05-31-07, Bertie's Challenge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018012627/http://www.iran-daily.com/1386/2857/html/dotcoms.htm#s231654 |date=18 October 2007 }}, 5th paragraph</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=John Murray |title=Irish Poll Hits Fianna Fail |url=https://www.ft.com/content/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658 |accessdate=2019-11-28 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=13 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525190855/https://www.ft.com/content/60f3f4f4-f9f7-11dd-9daa-000077b07658 |archivedate=2017-05-25}}</ref> The two parties have shared broadly similar policies in the past, with their primary division being perceived as being steeped in [[Irish Civil War]] politics.

From them, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) tend to be [[centre-right]] whilst the social liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) are more centrist.<ref>[http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf Politieke Barometer: ''D66 middenpartij bij uitstek''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719123931/http://www.politiekebarometer.nl/pdf/pb-2009-wk21extra.pdf |date=19 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant]] [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] is a small [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] party that has transversalist positions less typical in European centrist parties. Whilst it is left-leaning on issues such as immigration, welfare and the environment, it is more conservative on social issues, such as [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[euthanasia]]. They have participated in several coalitions due to their moderate centrist politics.\n\n[[Livable Netherlands]] was originally a centrist political movement of local grass-root parties with an anti-establishment touch similar to early D66. However, the party entered in 2002 national parliament with a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] programme based [[Law and order (politics)|on security]] and immigration as the major issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, there were two self-described \"centre\" parties, the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] and the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] who at some point were represented in [[Tweede Kamer|Dutch parliament]]. However these parties were considered as [[far right]] (in the case of the Centre Democrats) or even [[extreme right]] (in the case of the Centre Party) in their opinion about foreign immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/nl/Educatie/monitor/Kronieken/Kroniek-extreemrechts/De-Centrumstroming/De-Centrumpartij/|title=Kroniek extreemrechts: De Centrumpartij|first=Anne Frank|last=Stichting|date=20 January 2011|website=annefrank.org}}</ref> Both parties denied being racist or extremist in character. The party slogan of the Center Party was ''\"niet rechts, niet links\"'' (\"Neither rightist nor leftist\"), and in some respect could be seen as a centrist (or more correctly [[Third Position]]) party since it borrowed ideas from the political (far) right (a tough stand on immigration combined with typical racial prejudice) and the political left ([[mixed economy]], green politics). However both of these two parties didn't really have a coherent ideology; they were basically one-issue parties focussed on what the perceived as mass immigration from non-European countries.\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\n[[File:Senterpartiet campaining Norwegian Storting elections 2005 Picture from N\u00e6rb\u00f8 at J\u00e6ren.JPG|thumb|Campaign for the Norwegian [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] at [[N\u00e6rb\u00f8]]: like its [[Centre Party (Finland)|Finnish]] and [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Swedish]] counterparts, the party has a strong focus on decentralisation, rural and agrarian issues]]\n{{main|Nordic agrarian parties}}\n{{see also|Centrism in Finland|Centrism in Iceland|Centrism in Sweden}}\nIn most of the [[Nordic countries]], there are [[Nordic agrarian parties]]. These share in addition to the centrist position on the socio-economic left-right scale a clear, separate ideology.\n\nThis position is centred on [[decentralisation]], a commitment to [[small business]] and [[environmentalism|environmental protection]]. Centrists have aligned themselves with the [[Liberal International]] and [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]. Historically, all of these parties were farmers' parties committed to maintaining rural life. In the 1960s, these parties broadened their scope to include non-farmer-related issues and renamed themselves [[Centre Party (disambiguation)|Centre Party]].\n\nNeither the [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] (a now defunct centrist political party) nor the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] (a political party founded as a centrist social liberal party, but that now is a classical liberal party), both of Denmark, are rooted in centrist agrarianism.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\n[[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI), founded by [[Imran Khan]], claims to be a centrist political party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/06/28/survey-imran-khan-most-popular-leader-of-pakistan/|title=Survey: Imran Khan most popular leader of Pakistan|first=Mirza|last=Hassan|date=28 June 2012|work=TheNewsTribe.com|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> Following the [[2013 Pakistani general election|general election of 2013]], PTI emerged as the second-largest political party in Pakistan by number of votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.com.pk/|title=elections.com.pk|access-date=4 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205064535/http://elections.com.pk/|archivedate=5 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In July 2018 it won the general elections of Pakistan and [[Imran Khan]], its chairman, became Prime Minister.<ref name=\"PTI_2018Election\">{{cite web |last1=Saifi |first1=Sophia |last2=Raja |first2=Adeel |last3=Dewan |first3=Angela |title=Imran Khan's party wins Pakistan election but falls short of majority |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/28/asia/pakistan-election-results-imran-khan-intl/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Palestine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe [[Third Way (Palestinian authority)|Third Way]] is a small centrist Palestinian political party active in Palestinian politics. Founded on 16 December 2005, the party is led by [[Salam Fayyad]] and [[Hanan Ashrawi]].\n\nIn the January 2006 PLC elections, it received 2.41% of the popular vote and won two of the Council's 132 seats. The party presents itself as an alternative to the two-party system of [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]].\n\n=== Poland ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Civic Platform]] (PO), ruling in 2007\u20132015, began in 2001 as a liberal conservative party, but later under the leadership of [[Donald Tusk]] turned into typical centrist in order to attract left-leading liberal voters. Depending on the context, it is described as either Christian Democratic (it is a member of [[European People's Party]]), conservative, liberal, or social. Its pragmatism, technocracy and lack of ideology have been nevertheless criticized and currently, under the new leader [[Grzegorz Schetyna]] announced that it is returning to the right, but as part of [[Civic Coalition (Poland)|Civic Coalition]] it turns to progressivism again. Other political groups like [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL) may be described as centrist too (in Poland, national-moral right-wing [[Law and Justice]] is [[social conservative]], usually at the same time economical left and favor [[protectionism]] policies).\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe only national party that defends itself as a centrist party is [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], whose platform is been increasingly perceived as right-wing by the Spanish citizens as the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas]] surveys show. In April 2018 Ciudadanos obtained a 6,77, when ranging political parties from 1 to 10, where 1 was farthest left and 10 its equivalent in the right.<ref>[http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/3200_3219/3210/es3210mar.pdf] Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas. 27 July 2018</ref> It first entered the [[Cortes Generales]] in 2015.\n\nIn Catalonia, where the party was born, many people even consider it as an extreme right-wing party, considering its fierce \"opposition to nationalism\".

The new New Labour era is seen as ending when Blair's successor [[Gordon Brown]] lost the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] to the Conservatives. Brown's successor as leader, [[Ed Miliband]], moved the party (slightly) to the left of New Labour era position.

The party later moved decisively to the left when the socialist [[Jeremy Corbyn]] became leader in 2015, as a result of the introduction of a [[one member one vote]] system under Miliband.\n\nIn March 2011, [[Nick Clegg]], the-then leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], stated that he believed that his party belonged to the radical centre, mentioning [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[William Beveridge]], [[Jo Grimond]], [[David Lloyd George]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] as examples of the radical centre that preceded the Liberal Democrats' establishment in 1988. He pointed to liberalism as an ideology of people and described the political spectrum and his party's position as follows: \"For the left, an obsession with the state. For the right, a worship of the market. But as liberals, we place our faith in people. People with power and opportunity in their hands. Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre\".\n\nIn the 2000s, [[David Cameron]] also moved the Conservative Party towards the centre, allowing his party to be [[2010 United Kingdom general election|elected in 2010]] in a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition with the Liberal Democrats]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]], the Conservatives gained a majority and the Liberal Democrats lost most of their seats. They regained a small number of seats in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 election]]. Cameron's successor [[Theresa May]] used left-wing rhetoric on her appointment as Prime Minister, stating her wish to tackle social inequality, and adopted some of Ed Miliband's policies; for example, on regulating energy companies. However, the party's 2017 manifesto was seen as sharp break from the centre ground, appealing to traditionally Tory heartland issues in the aftermath of the UK's [[Brexit referendum]].\n\nFollowing the [[Brexit referendum]], politics in the UK was seen as having reverted to traditionally polarised \"left and right\" politics. For the 2017 election, the group [[More United]] was set up in the vein of the US [[Super PAC]] model to support candidates from multiple parties who meet its values; it gave support primarily to Labour and Lib Dem MPs, as well as one Conservative. In April 2018, ''The Observer'' newspaper reported that a group setup by Simon Franks had amassed \u00a350 million to start a new centrist political party in the UK to field candidates at the next general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/07/new-political-party-break-mould-westminster-uk-brexit|title=New centrist party gets \u00a350m backing to 'break mould' of UK politics|first=Michael|last=Savage|date=8 April 2018|website=the Guardian}}</ref> It has reportedly been named [[United for Change]].\n\nIn early 2019, difficulties and party clashes regarding Brexit caused a number of Labour and Conservative MPs to leave their parties, forming a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] group named [[The Independent Group]].

(2005). ''Making sense of heritability''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 48.</ref> uses the terms ''statistical'' and ''commonsense'' interaction.\n\nThe biometric (or statistical) conception has its origins in research programs that seek to measure the relative proportions of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation within populations. Biometric gene\u2013environment interaction has particular currency in [[population genetics]] and [[behavioral genetics]].<ref name=\"tabery2007\"/> Any interaction results in the breakdown of the additivity of the [[main effect]]s of heredity and environment, but whether such interaction is present in particular settings is an empirical question. Biometric interaction is relevant in the context of research on individual differences rather than in the context of the development of a particular organism.<ref name=\"tabery2010\">{{cite book | last1 = Tabery | first1 = James | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = Paul E. | year = 2010 | chapter = Historical and Philosophical Perspectives on Behavioral Genetics and Developmental Science |  veditors = Hood KE, Halpern CT, Greenberg G, Lerner RM | title = Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | pages = 41\u201360 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopmental gene\u2013environment interaction is a concept more commonly used by [[Developmental genetics|developmental geneticists]] and [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]]. Developmental interaction is not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical interaction is present or not, developmental interaction is in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.<ref name=\"tabery2010\"/>\n\n== Epidemiological models of GxE ==\nIn epidemiology, the following models can be used to group the different interactions between gene and environment.\n\nModel A describes a genotype that increases the level of expression of a risk factor but does not cause the disease itself. For example, the PKU gene results in higher levels of phenylalanine than normal which in turn causes mental retardation.\n\nThe risk factor in Model B in contrast has a direct effect on disease susceptibility which is amplified by the genetic susceptibility. Model C depicts the inverse, where the genetic susceptibility directly effects disease while the risk factor amplifies this effect. In each independent situation, the factor directly effecting the disease can cause disease by itself.\n\nModel D differs as neither factor in this situation can effect disease risk, however, when both genetic susceptibility and risk factor are present the risk is increased. For example, the G6PD deficiency gene when combined with fava bean consumption results in hemolytic anemia. This disease does not arise in individuals that eat fava beans and lack G6PD deficiency nor in G6PD-deficient people who do not eat fava beans.\n\nLastly, Model E depicts a scenario where the environmental risk factor and genetic susceptibility can individually both influence disease risk. When combined, however, the effect on disease risk differs.\n\nThe models are limited by the fact that the variables are binary and so do not consider polygenic or continuous scale variable scenarios.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\n== Methods of analysis ==\n\n=== Traditional genetic designs ===\n\n==== Adoption studies ====\nAdoption studies have been used to investigate how similar individuals that have been adopted are to their biological parents with whom they did not share the same environment with. Additionally, adopted individuals are compared to their adoptive family due to the difference in genes but shared environment. For example, an adoption study showed that Swedish men with disadvantaged adoptive environments and a genetic predisposition were more likely to abuse alcohol.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick DM | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction in psychological traits and disorders | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 383\u2013409 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21219196 | pmc = 3647367 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104518 | url = http://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/15485943/v7inone/383_giiptad.xml }}</ref>\n\n==== Twin studies ====\nUsing [[Twin|monozygotic twins]], the effects of different environments on identical genotypes could be observed.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) are compared with single binary exposure factors to determine any effects.\n\nCandidate studies such as these require strong biological hypotheses which are currently difficult to select given the little understanding of biological mechanisms that lead to higher risk.\n\nThese studies are also often difficult to replicate commonly due to small sample sizes which typically results in disputed results.\n\nThe [[Polygene|polygenic]] nature of complex phenotypes suggests single candidate studies could be ineffective in determining the various smaller scale effects from the large number of influencing gene variants.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assary E, Vincent JP, Keers R, Pluess M | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions | journal = Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology | volume = 77 | pages = 133\u2013143 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29051054 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.10.016 | url = http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/28312 }}</ref>\n\n==== Interaction with multiple genes ====\nSince the same environmental factor could interact with multiple genes, a polygenic approach can be taken to analyze GxE interactions. A [[polygenic score]] is generated using the alleles associated with a trait and their respective weights based on effect and examined in combination with environmental exposure. Though this method of research is still early, it is consistent with psychiatric disorders.  As a result of the overlap of endophenotypes amongst disorders this suggests that the outcomes of gene\u2013environment interactions are applicable across various diagnoses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Genome-wide association studies and genome wide interaction studies ====\nA genome wide interaction scan (GEWIS) approach examines the interaction between the environment and a large number of independent SNP's.

There is disagreement on which scale should be used. Under these analyses, if the combined variables fit either model then there is no interaction. The combined effects must either be greater for synergistic or less than for an antagonistic outcome. The additive model measures risk differences while the multiplicative model uses ratios to measure effects. The additive model has been suggested to be a better fit for predicting disease risk in a population while a multiplicative model is more appropriate for disease etiology.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\nEpigenetics is an example of an underlying mechanism of gene\u2013environment effects, however, it does not conclude whether environment effects are additive, multiplicative or interactive.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Gene \"\u00d7\" environment \"\u00d7\" environment interactions ==\nNew studies have also revealed the interactive effect of multiple environment factors.

In [[genetic epidemiology]], gene\u2013environment interactions are useful for understanding some [[diseases]]. Sometimes, sensitivity to environmental [[risk factors]] for a disease are inherited rather than the disease itself being inherited. Individuals with different genotypes are affected differently by exposure to the same environmental factors, and thus gene\u2013environment interactions can result in different disease phenotypes.

The first instance of debate occurred between [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Lancelot Hogben]].\nGalat h\nFisher sought to eliminate interaction from statistical studies as it was a phenomenon that could be removed using a variation in scale. Hogben believed that the interaction should be investigated instead of eliminated as it provided information on the causation of certain elements of development.\n\nA similar argument faced multiple scientists in the 1970s. [[Arthur Jensen]] published the study \u201c[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?|How much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement?]]\u201d, which amongst much criticism also faced contention by scientists [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[David Layzer]]. Lewontin and Layzer argued that in order to conclude causal mechanisms, the gene\u2013environment interaction could not be ignored in the context of the study while Jensen defended that interaction was purely a statistical phenomenon and not related to development.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabery J | title = Debating interaction: the history, and an explanation | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1117\u201323 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25855719 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyv053 }}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, Kenneth J.

In contrast to previous debates, Moffitt and Caspi were now using the statistical analysis to prove that interaction existed and could be used to uncover the mechanisms of a vulnerability trait. Contention came from Zammit, Owen and Lewis who reiterated the concerns of Fisher in that the statistical effect was not related to the developmental process and would not be replicable with a difference of scale.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Definitions ==\nThere are two different conceptions of gene\u2013environment interaction today.

Biometric gene\u2013environment interaction has particular currency in [[population genetics]] and [[behavioral genetics]].<ref name=\"tabery2007\"/> Any interaction results in the breakdown of the additivity of the [[main effect]]s of heredity and environment, but whether such interaction is present in particular settings is an empirical question. Biometric interaction is relevant in the context of research on individual differences rather than in the context of the development of a particular organism.<ref name=\"tabery2010\">{{cite book | last1 = Tabery | first1 = James | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = Paul E. | year = 2010 | chapter = Historical and Philosophical Perspectives on Behavioral Genetics and Developmental Science |  veditors = Hood KE, Halpern CT, Greenberg G, Lerner RM | title = Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | pages = 41\u201360 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopmental gene\u2013environment interaction is a concept more commonly used by [[Developmental genetics|developmental geneticists]] and [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]]. Developmental interaction is not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical interaction is present or not, developmental interaction is in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.<ref name=\"tabery2010\"/>\n\n== Epidemiological models of GxE ==\nIn epidemiology, the following models can be used to group the different interactions between gene and environment.\n\nModel A describes a genotype that increases the level of expression of a risk factor but does not cause the disease itself. For example, the PKU gene results in higher levels of phenylalanine than normal which in turn causes mental retardation.\n\nThe risk factor in Model B in contrast has a direct effect on disease susceptibility which is amplified by the genetic susceptibility. Model C depicts the inverse, where the genetic susceptibility directly effects disease while the risk factor amplifies this effect. In each independent situation, the factor directly effecting the disease can cause disease by itself.\n\nModel D differs as neither factor in this situation can effect disease risk, however, when both genetic susceptibility and risk factor are present the risk is increased. For example, the G6PD deficiency gene when combined with fava bean consumption results in hemolytic anemia. This disease does not arise in individuals that eat fava beans and lack G6PD deficiency nor in G6PD-deficient people who do not eat fava beans.\n\nLastly, Model E depicts a scenario where the environmental risk factor and genetic susceptibility can individually both influence disease risk. When combined, however, the effect on disease risk differs.\n\nThe models are limited by the fact that the variables are binary and so do not consider polygenic or continuous scale variable scenarios.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\n== Methods of analysis ==\n\n=== Traditional genetic designs ===\n\n==== Adoption studies ====\nAdoption studies have been used to investigate how similar individuals that have been adopted are to their biological parents with whom they did not share the same environment with. Additionally, adopted individuals are compared to their adoptive family due to the difference in genes but shared environment. For example, an adoption study showed that Swedish men with disadvantaged adoptive environments and a genetic predisposition were more likely to abuse alcohol.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick DM | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction in psychological traits and disorders | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 383\u2013409 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21219196 | pmc = 3647367 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104518 | url = http://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/15485943/v7inone/383_giiptad.xml }}</ref>\n\n==== Twin studies ====\nUsing [[Twin|monozygotic twins]], the effects of different environments on identical genotypes could be observed.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) are compared with single binary exposure factors to determine any effects.\n\nCandidate studies such as these require strong biological hypotheses which are currently difficult to select given the little understanding of biological mechanisms that lead to higher risk.\n\nThese studies are also often difficult to replicate commonly due to small sample sizes which typically results in disputed results.\n\nThe [[Polygene|polygenic]] nature of complex phenotypes suggests single candidate studies could be ineffective in determining the various smaller scale effects from the large number of influencing gene variants.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assary E, Vincent JP, Keers R, Pluess M | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions | journal = Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology | volume = 77 | pages = 133\u2013143 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29051054 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.10.016 | url = http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/28312 }}</ref>\n\n==== Interaction with multiple genes ====\nSince the same environmental factor could interact with multiple genes, a polygenic approach can be taken to analyze GxE interactions. A [[polygenic score]] is generated using the alleles associated with a trait and their respective weights based on effect and examined in combination with environmental exposure.

There is disagreement on which scale should be used. Under these analyses, if the combined variables fit either model then there is no interaction. The combined effects must either be greater for synergistic or less than for an antagonistic outcome. The additive model measures risk differences while the multiplicative model uses ratios to measure effects. The additive model has been suggested to be a better fit for predicting disease risk in a population while a multiplicative model is more appropriate for disease etiology.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\nEpigenetics is an example of an underlying mechanism of gene\u2013environment effects, however, it does not conclude whether environment effects are additive, multiplicative or interactive.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Gene \"\u00d7\" environment \"\u00d7\" environment interactions ==\nNew studies have also revealed the interactive effect of multiple environment factors.

In the absence of this enzyme, an [[amino acid]] known as phenylalanine does not get converted into the next amino acid in a [[Metabolic pathway|biochemical pathway]], and therefore too much phenylalanine passes into the blood and other tissues. This disturbs [[Neural development|brain development]] leading to [[mental retardation]] and other problems. PKU affects approximately 1 out of every 15,000 infants in the U.S. However, most affected infants do not grow up impaired because of a standard screening program used in the U.S. and other industrialized societies. Newborns found to have high levels of phenylalanine in their blood can be put on a special, phenylalanine-free diet. If they are put on this diet right away and stay on it, these children avoid the severe effects of PKU.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.aaas.org/page/behavioral-genetics-chapters|title=Behavioral Genetics|last=Baker|first=Catherine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=AAAS|year=2004|isbn=978-0871686978|chapter=Chapter 3.

When not studying, the close friends are obsessed with their Bey tops, creating a school bey club and challenging each other to battles at their Bey Stadium. The friends eventually become friendly rivals as they compete against each other in a competition to claim the title of Japan\u2019s top Blader and to beat the undefeated Lui Shirosagi and his Beyblade, Lost Luinor.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Evolution'' (2017\u201318)===\nIn season two of Beyblade Burst, Valt Aoi, who hails from Japan was a top competitor in the Japanese Championship. In Season Two, ''Evolution'', Valt is scouted for the prestigious Spanish team \"BC Sol\" and heads out to Spain. When he arrives in Spain, he runs into some old friends and meets some new ones who end up accompanying him along his journey. Valt\u2019s first battle in Spain leaves his bey, Valtryek, with an opportunity to evolve, making it stronger. Valt and his friends set their sights on becoming the World Champion; however, in order to qualify, they must first take the European League by winning team battles against other teams from around the globe. Valt is able to rank his way up. However, his old friend Shu has been tricked into becoming evil and has broken every bey he battles. Shu AKA Red Eye and Valt battle and Valtryek`s tip Reboot gets broken in half. He gets an evolved tip (Ultimate Reboot) and makes his way up again and then is able to stop Red Eye (Shu's Identity when controlled by Spryzen Requiem), bringing Shu back to normal. Valt is now the world champion.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Turbo'' (2018\u201319)===\nTwo years after the International Blader's Cup, the story focuses on Aiger Akabane, a \"wild child\" that grew up in nature. After battling Valt Aoi, he became inspired to become the No.1 Blader in the world, along with his beyblade, Z Achilles. He aims to fight strong opponents in an effort to become stronger himself. To defeat Valt Aoi and become the World Champion, Aiger begins his journey. \n\n===''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (2019\u201320)===\nLegendary Blader Valt Aoi has been training the next generation of elite Bladers at Spain\u2019s BC Sol. One day, rookie Bladers Dante Koryu and Delta Zakuro witness Valt unleashing his newly-evolved Gamma Bey, Sword Valtryek. To their surprise, Valtryek radiates a golden light as it rockets around the stadium. Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cHyper-Flux\u201d state, both Dante and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip.

When not studying, the close friends are obsessed with their Bey tops, creating a school bey club and challenging each other to battles at their Bey Stadium. The friends eventually become friendly rivals as they compete against each other in a competition to claim the title of Japan\u2019s top Blader and to beat the undefeated Lui Shirosagi and his Beyblade, Lost Luinor.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Evolution'' (2017\u201318)===\nIn season two of Beyblade Burst, Valt Aoi, who hails from Japan was a top competitor in the Japanese Championship. In Season Two, ''Evolution'', Valt is scouted for the prestigious Spanish team \"BC Sol\" and heads out to Spain. When he arrives in Spain, he runs into some old friends and meets some new ones who end up accompanying him along his journey. Valt\u2019s first battle in Spain leaves his bey, Valtryek, with an opportunity to evolve, making it stronger. Valt and his friends set their sights on becoming the World Champion; however, in order to qualify, they must first take the European League by winning team battles against other teams from around the globe. Valt is able to rank his way up. However, his old friend Shu has been tricked into becoming evil and has broken every bey he battles. Shu AKA Red Eye and Valt battle and Valtryek`s tip Reboot gets broken in half. He gets an evolved tip (Ultimate Reboot) and makes his way up again and then is able to stop Red Eye (Shu's Identity when controlled by Spryzen Requiem), bringing Shu back to normal. Valt is now the world champion.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Turbo'' (2018\u201319)===\nTwo years after the International Blader's Cup, the story focuses on Aiger Akabane, a \"wild child\" that grew up in nature. After battling Valt Aoi, he became inspired to become the No.1 Blader in the world, along with his beyblade, Z Achilles. He aims to fight strong opponents in an effort to become stronger himself. To defeat Valt Aoi and become the World Champion, Aiger begins his journey. \n\n===''Beyblade Burst Rise'' (2019\u201320)===\nLegendary Blader Valt Aoi has been training the next generation of elite Bladers at Spain\u2019s BC Sol. One day, rookie Bladers Dante Koryu and Delta Zakuro witness Valt unleashing his newly-evolved Gamma Bey, Sword Valtryek. To their surprise, Valtryek radiates a golden light as it rockets around the stadium. Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cHyper-Flux\u201d state, both Dante and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip. Dante soon realizes he\u2019ll have to do whatever it takes to deepen his bond with Dragon.\n\nDo Dante and Dragon have what it takes to overcome these challenges? And will they ever achieve Hyper-Flux?. Here begins the story of Dante and Dragon's rise to the peak of the Blading world.\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Superking'' (2020-21)===\n{{expand-section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Official characters==\n{{section split|List of Beyblade Burst characters|date=November 2017}}\n===Main characters===\n;Valt Aoi / {{nihongo|Baruto Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95 \u30d0\u30eb\u30c8|Aoi Baruto}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Kimlinh Tran]] (season 3)}}\nValt is an energetic 11-year-old boy who dreams on being world champion.\n\n;Rantaro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u592a\u90ce|Kiyama Rantar\u014d}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Matt Hill]] (seasons 1 and 2)}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Honcho|\u30af\u30df\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Kumicho}}'''\n\n;Ranjiro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u6b21\u90ce|Kiyama Ranjiro)}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Cap'n|\u30bd\u30fc\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Socho}}'''\n\n;Ken Midori / {{nihongo|Kensuke Midorikawa|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u30b1\u30f3\u30b9\u30b1|Midorikawa Kensuke}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]|[[Gabe Khouth]]}}\n\n;Daigo Kurogami / {{nihongo|Daina Kurogami|\u9ed2\u795e \u30c0\u30a4\u30ca|Kurogami Daina}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ayahi Takagaki]]|[[Antony Kim]] (first half of season one), [[Zach LeBlanc]] (from second half of season one to season two)}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Hoji Konda|\u7d3a\u7530\u30db\u30a6\u30b8/\u7d3a\u7530\u6cd5\u4e8b|Konda Houji}}\n:{{animevoices|[[T\u014dru Nara]]|[[Brett Bauer]]}}\n\n;Wakiya Murasaki / {{nihongo|Wakiya Komurasaki|\u5c0f\u7d2b \u30ef\u30ad\u30e4|Komurasaki Wakiya}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]|[[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shu Kurenai|\u7d05 \u30b7\u30e5\u30a6|Kurenai Sh\u016b}}/ {{nihongo|Red Eye|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30a4|Reddo Ai}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junya Enoki]]|[[Adrian Petriw]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Alan Lee]] (season 3)}}\n\n;Toko Aoi / {{nihongo|Tokonatsu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5e38\u590f|Aoi Tokonatsu}}\n:{{animevoices|[[You Taichi]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Nika Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u65e5\u590f|Aoi Nika}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Inase]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiharu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5343\u6625|Aoi Chiharu}}\n\n;Kit Lopez / {{nihongo|Kitto Ropesu|\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30ed\u30da\u30b9|Ropesu Kitto}}\n\n;Silas Karlisle (Sisco Karlisle) / {{nihongo|Shisuko K\u0101rairu|\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30eb|K\u0101rairu Shisuko}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takuma Terashima]]|[[Connor Parnall]]}}\n\n;Free De La Hoya / {{nihongo|Fur\u012b Derah\u014dya|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30c7\u30e9\u30db\u30fc\u30e4|Derah\u014dya Fur\u012b}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ryoko Shiraishi]]|Sean Thomas}}\n\n;Cuza Ackerman / {{nihongo|K\u016bza Akk\u0101man\u30af\u30fc\u30b6\u30a2\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30f3&\u30ab\u30fc\u30eb |Akk\u0101man K\u016bza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junko Takeuchi]]|Valin Shinyei}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Rickson Clay|\u30ea\u30af\u30bd\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30a4|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shasa Guten (Sasha Guten)|\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3/|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Honey Guten|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3|}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Koga]]|[[Caitlyn Bairstow]]}}\n\n;Kristina Kuroda / {{nihongo|Kurisut\u012bna Kuroda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ca \u30af\u30ed\u30c0|Kuroda Kurisut\u012bna}}\n\n;Raul Comas / {{nihongo|Zoro|\u30be\u30ed|Zoro}}\n\n;Trad Vazquez / {{nihongo|Toraddo Basukesu|\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u30b9|Basukesu Toraddo}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Orochi Ginba|\u9280\u5203\u30aa\u30ed\u30c1/ \u9280\u5203\u5927\u86c7|Ginba Orochi}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takahiro Mizushima]]|[[Daniel Bacon]]}} \n\n;Alexander 'Xander' Shakadera / {{nihongo|Kaiza Shakuenji|\u707c\u708e\u5bfa \u30ab\u30a4\u30b6|Shakuenji Kaiza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Andrew Francis]]}}\n:Also known as '''Xander / {{nihongo4|Xhaka|\u30b7\u30e3\u30ab|Kshaka}}'''.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yugo Nansui|\u5357\u7fe0\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4|Nansui Yugo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Daichi Hayashi]]|[[Nick Wolfhard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ukyo Ibuki|\u96ea\u5439\u53f3\u4eac|Ibuki Ukyo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Natsumi Fujiwara]]|[[Vincent Tong]]}}\n\n;Zac Kaneguro / {{nihongo|Zenkuro Kurogane|\u9ed2\u9280\u5584\u4e5d\u90ce|Kurogane Zenkuro}}\n:Also known as '''Zac the Sunrise / Zac the Sunshine'''.\n\n;Quon Limon / {{nihongo|Quon Kimidori|\u9ec4\u7dd1\u30af\u30aa\u30f3|Kimidori Quon}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Nishigaki]]|[[Jonathan Whitesell]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ben Azuki|\u5c0f\u8c46\u30d9\u30f3|Azuki Ben}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mariko Higashiuchi]]|[[David A.

The system uses the on-board [[accelerometer]]s in privately-owned smartphones of volunteer participants to detect earthquake waves (rather than conventional [[seismometer]]s). When it detects an earthquake, it issues an earthquake warning to alert people who the damaging waves of the earthquake have not yet reached.\n\nThe project started on January 1, 2013 with the release of the homonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application Earthquake Network.

Additionally, the number of active smartphones (not in use and connected to a source of power) constantly changes during the day. Globally, the total number of smartphones with the application installed is around 750,000 (September 2017) and the number of active smartphones ranges from around 30,000 to around 120,000 depending on the hour of the day. The geographic distribution of the network nodes is given in the following table.\n\n[[File:Earthquake Network spatial distribution.jpg|thumb|right|600px|Smartphone network spatial distribution (green and red dots) on December 4, 2015]]\n[[File:Santiago and valparaiso.jpg|thumbnail|400px|Smartphone network in [[Santiago]] area on December 5, 2015]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Geographic distribution (September 2017)\n!

Most of the earthquakes were detected in Chile where the network is quite stable in terms of number of smartphones. As an example, the [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 8.3 [[2015 Illapel earthquake|Illapel earthquake]] was detected by the smartphones in the city of [[Valpara\u00edso]]. Smartphones in [[Santiago]] received the warning 10 seconds before the earthquake, while smartphones in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] received the warning 20 seconds in advance.\n\n==Project development==\nThe Earthquake Network project is expected to solve 4 main problems related to earthquake detection and location using a smartphone network.\n\n===Real-time detection===\nTo be effective, the earthquake warning system of the Earthquake Network project must detect the earthquake as fast as possible. It detects earthquakes through [[Near real-time|real-time]] analysis of the data that the smartphone network sends to the central server. Since smartphones detect accelerations not necessarily induced by an earthquake, the server implements a statistical algorithm that recognizes real earthquakes against background noise. The statistical methods at the basis of the algorithm provides control over the probability of false alarm. Development stage: released.\n\n===Epicenter estimation===\nWhen detection occurs, it is important to obtain an estimate of the epicenter in order to locate the geographic areas that was affected by the earthquake. Two epicenter estimation algorithms for crowdsourced smartphone-based earthquake early warning systems have been developed and they are detailed in a paper<ref name=\"finazzi\"/> published on the [[Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America]] journal. Development stage: released.\n\n===Peak ground acceleration===\nThe accelerations recorded by a dense smartphone network can be used to produce high resolution [[peak ground acceleration]] maps for the detected earthquakes. The task is complicated by the fact that smartphones are not secured to the ground, so they don't directly measure ground acceleration. If properly [[Calibration|calibrated]], however, data from a large number of smartphones may be sufficient to estimate ground acceleration. Development stage: analysis.\n\n===Magnitude estimation===\nThe earthquake [[Seismic scale|magnitude]] is an important parameter, as it defines the energy released by the earthquake event and helps evaluate earthquake severity in terms of potential damages to property and people. Magnitude estimation using the data collected by the smartphone network is currently under study. Development stage: analysis.\n\n==References==\n<!-- Do not add a scroll box here -->\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://earthquakenetwork.it/ Earthquake Network] - The Earthquake Network project website\n*[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finazzi.distquake Earthquake Network Android application] - The Android application of the Earthquake Network project\n\n[[Category:Earthquake and seismic risk mitigation]]\n[[Category:Crowdsourcing]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}\n{{Infobox distributed computing project\n| name                   = Earthquake Network\n| logo                   = Network-globe-icon 512 wave.png\n| author                 = Francesco Finazzi\n| developer              = Francesco Finazzi\n| released               = {{start date |2013|01|01}}\n| latest release date    = {{start date and age|2013|5|6}}\n| status                 = Online\n| goal                   = Smartphone-based earthquake early warning\n| software               = [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finazzi.distquake Earthquake Network]\n| funding                = [[Mobile advertising|In-app advertising]]\n| operating system       = [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n| language               = English, Spanish, Italian\n| genre                  = [[Volunteer computing]]\n|license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]]| active users           = {{increase}} 750,000 (September 2017)\n| website                = [http://earthquakenetwork.it/ Earthquake Network]\n}}\n\n'''Earthquake Network'''<ref name=\"finazzi\">{{cite journal|last1=Finazzi|first1=Francesco|year=2016|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|volume=106|issue=3|pages=1088\u20131099|title=The Earthquake Network Project: Toward a Crowdsourced Smartphone\u2010Based Earthquake Early Warning System|accessdate=10 June 2016|doi=10.1785/0120150354|url=http://www.bssaonline.org/content/106/3/1088.full|arxiv=1512.01026}}</ref> is a research project that aims to develop and maintain a [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] smartphone-based [[earthquake warning system]] at a global level.
