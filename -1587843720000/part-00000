In that era, the university provided two-year pre-clinical education certificates, and graduates went out of state to complete doctor of medicine degrees. In 1950, the Mississippi Legislature voted to create a four-year medical school. On July 1, 1955, the University Medical Center opened in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], as a four-year medical school. The [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]], as it is now called, is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi. It houses the University of Mississippi School of Medicine along with five other health science schools: nursing, dentistry, health-related professions, graduate studies and pharmacy (The School of Pharmacy is split between the Oxford and University of Mississippi Medical Center campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|title=Overview - University of Mississippi Medical Center|publisher=Umc.edu|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222200427/http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|archive-date=February 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were made via the executive and legislative branches of the Mississippi state government to relocate or otherwise close the University of Mississippi. The Mississippi Legislature between 1900 and 1930 introduced several bills aiming to accomplish this, but no legislation was ever passed by either house. One such bill was introduced in 1912 by Senator William Ellis of Carthage, Mississippi, which would have merged the college with then-Mississippi A&M.<ref>David Sansing, The History of the University of Mississippi: A Sesquicentennial History, Ch. 8</ref> However, this measure was soundly defeated, despite the bill only seeking to form an exploratory committee.\n\nIn February 1920, 56 members of the legislature arrived on campus and discussed with students and faculty the idea of consolidating MS A&M, MS College of Women and Ole Miss to be in Jackson, rather than appropriate $750,000.00 of funds requested by then-Chancellor Joseph Powers which were needed to repair dilapidated and structurally unsound buildings on the campus, which was discovered following the partial collapse of a dormitory in 1917 and a scathing review of other buildings later that same year by the state architect.<ref>David Sansing, The History of the University of Mississippi: A Sesquicentennial History, Ch. *</ref> These funds, plus an additional $300,000.00 were appropriated to the school, which was used to build 4 male dormitories, a female dormitory and a pharmacy building, which partially resolved a longstanding issue of inadequate dormitory space for students. During the 1930s, [[Governor of Mississippi|Mississippi Governor]] [[Theodore G. Bilbo]], a populist, tried to move the university to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]. Chancellor [[Alfred Hume]] gave the state legislators a grand tour of Ole Miss and the surrounding historic city of Oxford, persuading them to keep it in its original setting.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], UM was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"list-of-v-12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II|publisher=HyperWar Foundation|accessdate=September 29, 2011|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Integration of 1962 and legacy===\n[[File:James Meredith OleMiss.jpg|thumb|right|James Meredith walking to class at the University of Mississippi, accompanied by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]]]]\n\n{{See also|Ole Miss riot of 1962}}\n[[Desegregation]] came to Ole Miss in the early 1960s with the activities of [[United States Air Force]] veteran [[James Meredith]] from [[Kosciusko, Mississippi]].

In that era, the university provided two-year pre-clinical education certificates, and graduates went out of state to complete doctor of medicine degrees. In 1950, the Mississippi Legislature voted to create a four-year medical school. On July 1, 1955, the University Medical Center opened in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], as a four-year medical school. The [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]], as it is now called, is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi. It houses the University of Mississippi School of Medicine along with five other health science schools: nursing, dentistry, health-related professions, graduate studies and pharmacy (The School of Pharmacy is split between the Oxford and University of Mississippi Medical Center campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|title=Overview - University of Mississippi Medical Center|publisher=Umc.edu|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222200427/http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html|archive-date=February 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts were made via the executive and legislative branches of the Mississippi state government to relocate or otherwise close the University of Mississippi. The Mississippi Legislature between 1900 and 1930 introduced several bills aiming to accomplish this, but no legislation was ever passed by either house.

However, on 3 February 1014, Sven died suddenly.<ref name=\"sawyer76\" /> Capitalising on his death, \u00c6thelred returned to England and drove Sven's son, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], back to Denmark, forcing him to abandon his allies in the process.<ref name=\"sawyer76\" />\n\nIn 1015, Cnut launched a new campaign against England.<ref name=\"sawyer76\" /> [[Edmund II Ironside|Edmund]] fell out with his father, \u00c6thelred, and struck out on his own.<ref name=\"woods216\">Wood, ''In Search of the Dark Ages'', pp. 216\u201322</ref> Some English leaders decided to support Cnut, so \u00c6thelred ultimately retreated to London.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Before engagement with the Danish army, \u00c6thelred died and was replaced by Edmund.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> The Danish army encircled and besieged London, but Edmund was able to escape and raised an army of loyalists.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Edmund's army routed the Danes, but the success was short-lived: at the [[Battle of Ashingdon]], the Danes were victorious, and many of the English leaders were killed.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Cnut and Edmund agreed to split the kingdom in two, with Edmund ruling Wessex and Cnut the rest.<ref name=\"woods216\" /><ref>''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', 1016</ref>\n\nIn 1017, Edmund died in mysterious circumstances, probably murdered by Cnut or his supporters, and the English council ([[Witenagemot|the witan]]) confirmed Cnut as king of all England.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Cnut divided England into [[earldom]]s: most of these were allocated to nobles of Danish descent, but he made an Englishman earl of Wessex. The man he appointed was Godwin, who eventually became part of the extended royal family when he married the king's sister-in-law.<ref name=\"starkey94\">Starkey, ''Monarchy'', p. 94.</ref> In the summer of 1017, Cnut sent for \u00c6thelred's widow, Emma, with the intention of marrying her.<ref>''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', 1017: ''..before the calends of August the king gave an order to fetch him the widow of the other king, Ethelred, the daughter of Richard, to wife''.</ref> It seems that Emma agreed to marry the king on condition that he would limit the English succession to the children born of their union.<ref name=\"brown160\">Brown.

''Proceedings of the Battle Conference on Anglo-Norman studies''. pp. 160\u201361</ref> Cnut already had a wife, known as [[\u00c6lfgifu of Northampton]], who bore him two sons, Svein and [[Harold Harefoot]].<ref name=\"brown160\" /> The church, however, seems to have regarded \u00c6lfgifu as Cnut's concubine rather than his wife.<ref name=\"brown160\" /> In addition to the two sons he had with \u00c6lfgifu, he had a further son with Emma, who was named [[Harthacnut]].<ref name=\"brown160\" /><ref name=\"lapidge108\">Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nWhen Cnut's brother, [[Harald II of Denmark|Harald&nbsp;II, King of Denmark]], died in 1018, Cnut went to Denmark to secure that realm. Two years later, Cnut brought Norway under his control, and he gave \u00c6lfgifu and their son Svein the job of governing it.<ref name=\"lapidge108\" />\n\n=== Edward becomes king ===\nOne result of Cnut's marriage to Emma was to precipitate a succession crisis after his death in 1035,<ref name=\"lapidge108\" /> as the throne was disputed between \u00c6lfgifu's son, [[Harald Harefoot]], and Emma's son, [[Harthacnut]].<ref name=\"lapidge229\">Lapidge. ''Anglo-Saxon England''. pp. 229\u201330</ref> Emma supported her son by Cnut, Harthacnut, rather than a son by \u00c6thelred.<ref name=\"lapidge161\">Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 161\u201362</ref> Her son by \u00c6thelred, Edward, made an unsuccessful raid on Southampton, and his brother Alfred was murdered on an expedition to England in 1036.<ref name=\"lapidge161\" /> Emma fled to Bruges when Harald Harefoot became king of England, but when he died in 1040 Harthacnut was able to take over as king.<ref name=\"lapidge229\" /> Harthacnut quickly developed a reputation for imposing high taxes on England.<ref name=\"lapidge229\" /> He became so unpopular that Edward was invited to return from exile in Normandy to be recognised as Harthacnut's heir,<ref name=\"lapidge161\" /><ref name=\"lapidge230\">Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 230</ref> and when Harthacnut died suddenly in 1042 (probably murdered), Edward (known to posterity as [[Edward the Confessor]]) became king.<ref name=\"lapidge161\" />\n\nEdward was supported by Earl Godwin of Wessex and married the earl's daughter. This arrangement was seen as expedient, however, as Godwin had been implicated in the murder of Alfred, the king's brother. In 1051 one of Edward's in-laws, Eustace, arrived to take up residence in Dover; the men of Dover objected and killed some of Eustace's men.<ref name=\"lapidge161\" /> When Godwin refused to punish them, the king, who had been unhappy with [[House of Godwin|the Godwins]] for some time, summoned them to trial. Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was chosen to deliver the news to Godwin and his family.<ref name=\"barlow57\">Barlow, ''The Godwins'', pp. 57\u201358</ref> The Godwins fled rather than face trial.<ref name=\"barlow57\" /> Norman accounts suggest that at this time Edward offered the succession to his cousin, William (duke) of Normandy (also known as [[William the Conqueror]], William the Bastard, or William&nbsp;I), though this is unlikely given that accession to the Anglo-Saxon kingship was by election, not heredity \u2013 a fact which Edward would surely have known, having been elected himself by the [[Witenagemot]].\n\nThe Godwins, having previously fled, threatened to invade England.  Edward is said to have wanted to fight, but at a Great Council meeting in Westminster, Earl Godwin laid down all his weapons and asked the king to allow him to purge himself of all crimes.<ref name=\"barlow64\">Barlow, ''The Godwins'', pp. 64\u201365</ref> The king and Godwin were reconciled,<ref name=\"barlow64\" /> and the Godwins thus became the most powerful family in England after the king.<ref name=\"woods229\">Woods, ''Dark Ages'', pp. 229\u201330</ref><ref>Barlow, ''The Godwins'', pp. 83\u201385.

It consisted of various [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms until 927 when it was united as the [[Kingdom of England]] by King [[\u00c6thelstan]] (r. 927\u2013939). It became part of the short-lived [[North Sea Empire]] of [[Cnut the Great]], a [[personal union]] between England, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] in the 11th century.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons were the members of  [[Ingaevones|Germanic-speaking groups]] who [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|migrated]] to the southern half of the island of Great Britain from nearby [[northwestern Europe]]. Anglo-Saxon history thus begins during the period of [[sub-Roman Britain]] following the end of [[Roman Britain|Roman control]], and traces the establishment of [[List of Anglo-Saxon monarchs and kingdoms|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in  the 5th and 6th centuries (conventionally identified as [[Heptarchy|seven main kingdoms]]: [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]], [[kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]], and [[Wessex]]), their [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation]] during the 7th century, the threat of [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]] and [[Danelaw|Danish settlers]], the gradual [[unification of England]] under the [[Wessex#The hegemony of Wessex and the Viking raids|Wessex hegemony]] during the 9th and 10th centuries, and ending with the [[Norman conquest of England]] by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.\n\nAnglo-Saxon identity survived beyond the Norman conquest,<ref name=\"Higham, Nicholas J. 2013. p7-19\">Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J.

Thus the term for English people (Latin: ''gens Anglorum'';  Anglo-Saxon: ''Anglecynn'') was in use by then to distinguish Germanic groups in Britain from those on the continent (Old Saxony in Northern Germany).<ref name=\"Higham, Nicholas J. 2013. p7-19\" />{{efn|Throughout this article Anglo-Saxon is used for Saxon, Angle, Jute or Frisian unless it is specific to a point being made; \"Anglo-Saxon\" is used when the culture is meant as opposed to any ethnicity.}} The term 'Anglo-Saxon' came into use in the 8th century (probably by [[Paul the Deacon]]) to distinguish English Saxons from continental Saxons (Ealdseaxe, 'old' Saxons).\n\nThe historian [[James Campbell (historian)|James Campbell]] suggested that it was not until the [[Anglo-Saxons#Late Anglo-Saxon history (899\u20131066)|late Anglo-Saxon period]] that England could be described as a nation state.<ref name=campbell10>Campbell.

However, on 3 February 1014, Sven died suddenly.<ref name=\"sawyer76\" /> Capitalising on his death, \u00c6thelred returned to England and drove Sven's son, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], back to Denmark, forcing him to abandon his allies in the process.<ref name=\"sawyer76\" />\n\nIn 1015, Cnut launched a new campaign against England.<ref name=\"sawyer76\" /> [[Edmund II Ironside|Edmund]] fell out with his father, \u00c6thelred, and struck out on his own.<ref name=\"woods216\">Wood, ''In Search of the Dark Ages'', pp. 216\u201322</ref> Some English leaders decided to support Cnut, so \u00c6thelred ultimately retreated to London.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Before engagement with the Danish army, \u00c6thelred died and was replaced by Edmund.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> The Danish army encircled and besieged London, but Edmund was able to escape and raised an army of loyalists.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Edmund's army routed the Danes, but the success was short-lived: at the [[Battle of Ashingdon]], the Danes were victorious, and many of the English leaders were killed.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Cnut and Edmund agreed to split the kingdom in two, with Edmund ruling Wessex and Cnut the rest.<ref name=\"woods216\" /><ref>''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', 1016</ref>\n\nIn 1017, Edmund died in mysterious circumstances, probably murdered by Cnut or his supporters, and the English council ([[Witenagemot|the witan]]) confirmed Cnut as king of all England.<ref name=\"woods216\" /> Cnut divided England into [[earldom]]s: most of these were allocated to nobles of Danish descent, but he made an Englishman earl of Wessex. The man he appointed was Godwin, who eventually became part of the extended royal family when he married the king's sister-in-law.<ref name=\"starkey94\">Starkey, ''Monarchy'', p. 94.</ref> In the summer of 1017, Cnut sent for \u00c6thelred's widow, Emma, with the intention of marrying her.<ref>''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', 1017: ''..before the calends of August the king gave an order to fetch him the widow of the other king, Ethelred, the daughter of Richard, to wife''.</ref> It seems that Emma agreed to marry the king on condition that he would limit the English succession to the children born of their union.<ref name=\"brown160\">Brown.

''Proceedings of the Battle Conference on Anglo-Norman studies''. pp. 160\u201361</ref> Cnut already had a wife, known as [[\u00c6lfgifu of Northampton]], who bore him two sons, Svein and [[Harold Harefoot]].<ref name=\"brown160\" /> The church, however, seems to have regarded \u00c6lfgifu as Cnut's concubine rather than his wife.<ref name=\"brown160\" /> In addition to the two sons he had with \u00c6lfgifu, he had a further son with Emma, who was named [[Harthacnut]].<ref name=\"brown160\" /><ref name=\"lapidge108\">Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nWhen Cnut's brother, [[Harald II of Denmark|Harald&nbsp;II, King of Denmark]], died in 1018, Cnut went to Denmark to secure that realm. Two years later, Cnut brought Norway under his control, and he gave \u00c6lfgifu and their son Svein the job of governing it.<ref name=\"lapidge108\" />\n\n=== Edward becomes king ===\nOne result of Cnut's marriage to Emma was to precipitate a succession crisis after his death in 1035,<ref name=\"lapidge108\" /> as the throne was disputed between \u00c6lfgifu's son, [[Harald Harefoot]], and Emma's son, [[Harthacnut]].<ref name=\"lapidge229\">Lapidge. ''Anglo-Saxon England''. pp. 229\u201330</ref> Emma supported her son by Cnut, Harthacnut, rather than a son by \u00c6thelred.<ref name=\"lapidge161\">Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 161\u201362</ref> Her son by \u00c6thelred, Edward, made an unsuccessful raid on Southampton, and his brother Alfred was murdered on an expedition to England in 1036.<ref name=\"lapidge161\" /> Emma fled to Bruges when Harald Harefoot became king of England, but when he died in 1040 Harthacnut was able to take over as king.<ref name=\"lapidge229\" /> Harthacnut quickly developed a reputation for imposing high taxes on England.<ref name=\"lapidge229\" /> He became so unpopular that Edward was invited to return from exile in Normandy to be recognised as Harthacnut's heir,<ref name=\"lapidge161\" /><ref name=\"lapidge230\">Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 230</ref> and when Harthacnut died suddenly in 1042 (probably murdered), Edward (known to posterity as [[Edward the Confessor]]) became king.<ref name=\"lapidge161\" />\n\nEdward was supported by Earl Godwin of Wessex and married the earl's daughter. This arrangement was seen as expedient, however, as Godwin had been implicated in the murder of Alfred, the king's brother. In 1051 one of Edward's in-laws, Eustace, arrived to take up residence in Dover; the men of Dover objected and killed some of Eustace's men.<ref name=\"lapidge161\" /> When Godwin refused to punish them, the king, who had been unhappy with [[House of Godwin|the Godwins]] for some time, summoned them to trial. Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was chosen to deliver the news to Godwin and his family.<ref name=\"barlow57\">Barlow, ''The Godwins'', pp. 57\u201358</ref> The Godwins fled rather than face trial.<ref name=\"barlow57\" /> Norman accounts suggest that at this time Edward offered the succession to his cousin, William (duke) of Normandy (also known as [[William the Conqueror]], William the Bastard, or William&nbsp;I), though this is unlikely given that accession to the Anglo-Saxon kingship was by election, not heredity \u2013 a fact which Edward would surely have known, having been elected himself by the [[Witenagemot]].\n\nThe Godwins, having previously fled, threatened to invade England.  Edward is said to have wanted to fight, but at a Great Council meeting in Westminster, Earl Godwin laid down all his weapons and asked the king to allow him to purge himself of all crimes.<ref name=\"barlow64\">Barlow, ''The Godwins'', pp. 64\u201365</ref> The king and Godwin were reconciled,<ref name=\"barlow64\" /> and the Godwins thus became the most powerful family in England after the king.<ref name=\"woods229\">Woods, ''Dark Ages'', pp. 229\u201330</ref><ref>Barlow, ''The Godwins'', pp. 83\u201385.

The press box at Scott Stadium was a gift from an alumnus in honor of Norton G. Pritchett, the admired athletic director at UVA from 1934 until his death in 1950. Funding from benefactor Hunter Smith created the foundation for the 320-piece [[Cavalier Marching Band]] in 2004, replacing the [[Virginia Pep Band]] in its official capacity at athletic events. The late Cavalier head coach [[George Welsh (American football)|George Welsh]] is a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] and retired as the winningest head coach in ACC history.

The 2009 season of the Cavaliers saw them through to the CWS (College World Series) with a 49-15-1 record. The team made a return trip to Omaha two years later in 2011, where they lost to eventual National Champion South Carolina in the semi-final round. In 2014, the team made a third trip to the CWS, beat Ole Miss and TCU to advance to their first ever CWS finals, but lost the three-game series to Vanderbilt 2\u20131. [[2015 Virginia Cavaliers baseball team|The following year]], both they and Vanderbilt returned to the CWS finals in a rematch.

Since ACC Tournament play began in 1987, Virginia has played in 15 out of 19 ACC Tournament championship matches, winning ten ACC titles (including 2003, 2004, and 2009), to go with their seven NCAA Tournament championships (1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2009, 2014).

In doing so, the Cavaliers became the first [[Power Five]] program to sponsor men's squash, and only the second Power Five women's team (after [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]]). In only their 3rd varsity season the men's team finished 5th in the country and won the inaugural Mid-Atlantic Squash Conference championship. <ref name=\"squash\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cavalierinsider/uva-squash-goes-varsity/article_25463902-5db8-11e7-8672-b3cdcb5c026e.html |title=UVa squash goes varsity |first=Andrew |last=Ramspacher |newspaper=[[The Daily Progress]] |date=June 30, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Swimming and diving ===\n{{main article|Virginia Cavaliers swimming and diving}}\nThe men's swimming and diving team has won 16 ACC championships while the women's team has won 11.\n\n=== Tennis ===\n{{main article|Virginia Cavaliers men's tennis}}\nThe men's tennis team rose to prominence in the 21st century under coach [[Brian Boland (tennis)|Brian Boland]].

Following his retirement, former [[Georgia Bulldogs]] deputy athletic director [[Carla Williams]] was named as his replacement.\n\n==Athletics apparel sponsorships==\n\nDuring the 1990s, the football team's uniforms were provided by  [[Russell Athletic]] and [[Reebok]], before [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over those responsibilities.  During the early 2000s, the men's basketball team was outfitted by [[And1]], making them just one of four teams in the nation to wear that brand and making the Cavaliers their de facto flagship program (much like Oregon's relationship with Nike and Maryland's relationship with [[Under Armour]].  In 2004, the basketball team joined the rest of their Cavalier brethren in wearing Nike.  In 2015, UVA renewed their Nike commitment, signing a 10-year, $35 million deal that includes bonuses for nationally successful finishes in football, basketball, soccer, and lacrosse.  The $3.5 million a year deal is the fourth most lucrative in the ACC, following Nike's deal with Florida State, North Carolina's deal with [[Jordan Brand|Jordan]], and Notre Dame's deal with Under Armour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/sports/teel-blog/dp-teel-time-uva-nike-post.html|title=U.Va. signs 10-year extension with Nike, more than doubles cash, apparel|first=David|last=Teel|date=|website=dailypress.com}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2018, 24 of the 27 UVA sports teams are outfitted by Nike.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of
