The School of Law was formally established that year with the assistance of an Advisory Committee, consisting of Dean James Barr Ames of the [[Harvard University]] School of Law, Dean Samuel Bennett of the [[Boston University]] School of Law, and Judge James R. Dunbar. In 1903, the first Automobile Engineering School in the country was established followed by the School of Commerce and Finance in 1907. Day classes began in 1909. In 1916, a bill was introduced into the Massachusetts Legislature to incorporate the institute as '''Northeastern College'''.

By 1989\u20131990 University enrollment had reduced to about 40,000 full, part-time, and evening students, and in 1990 the first class with more live-on-campus than commuter students was graduated. Following the retirement of President Kenneth Ryder 1989, the University adopted a slow and more thoughtful approach to change. Historically, it had been accepting between 7,500 and 10,000 students per year based on applications of about 15,000 to 20,000 with acceptance rates between 50% and 75% depending on the program. Attrition rates were huge, with a 25% freshmen dropout rate and graduation rate below 50%, with only 40% <!-- 2,287 --> of 5,672 undergraduate full-time day students enrolled in the Fall of 1984 graduating by 1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhen President John Curry left office in 1996 the university population had been systematically reduced to about 25,000. Incoming President Richard Freeland decided to focus on recruiting the type of students who were already graduating as the school's prime demographic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the early 1990s, the university cut its freshman class size from around 4,500 students to 2,800 in order to become more selective and began a $485&nbsp;million construction program that included residence halls, academic and research facilities, and athletic centers. Between 1996 and 2006 average SAT scores increased more than 200 points, retention rates rose dramatically, and applications doubled.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n[[File:Northeastern Shillman Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Robert J.

Freeland stepped down on August 15, 2006 and was replaced by Dr. [[Joseph Aoun]], a former [[dean (education)|dean]] at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref name=\"boston\"/> Aoun implemented a decentralized management model, giving university deans more control over their budgets, faculty hiring decisions, and fundraising.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[File:NEU Ell Hall.jpg|thumb|Northeastern's historic [[Carl Stephens Ell|Ell Hall]] on Huntington Avenue.]]\nAs part of a five-year, $75&nbsp;million Academic Investment Plan that ran from 2004 and 2009<ref name=\"neu2\"/> the University concentrated on undergraduate education, core graduate professional programs, and centers of research excellence. Faculty was originally to be bolstered by 100 new tenured and tenure-track professors, later expanded to include 300 additional tenure and tenure-track faculty in interdisciplinary fields. Aoun also placed more emphasis on improving community relations by reaching out to leaders of the neighborhoods surrounding the university.<ref name=\"boston3\"/> In addition, Aoun has created more academic partnerships with other institutions in the Boston area, including [[Tufts]], [[Hebrew College]] and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts]].{{citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nDuring this time, Northeastern has advanced in national rankings. It placed 42nd in the 2014\u20132015 ''U.S. News & World Report'''s \"Best Colleges Guide\",<ref name=\"US News and World Report\">{{cite magazine|title=National Universities Rankings|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/page+5|accessdate=September 9, 2014|magazine=U.S. News & World Report}}</ref> a 7 position jump from 2013\u20132014 and a 27 place gain just since 2010\u20132011.

This explains why it was able to attain higher rankings than other local schools such as [[Simmons College]] and [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]] (which were started around the same time). Northeastern's reputation benefited from a positive feedback effect, in that improved rankings gave the university access to more resources which in turn allowed them to further improve the quality of the university and therefore their rankings. The quality of the university has improved dramatically within the last two decades as a result of the introduction of new academic programs, far more competitive applicants, new buildings, a larger endowment, alumni donations, new satellite campuses, and the expansion of their flagship Co-op program.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nMore recently the University has continued to focus on global expansion. In late 2018, Northeastern University announced the acquisition of the [[New College of the Humanities]], a small private London-based college founded by the philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]].

At the graduate level, there are about 125 programs. A Northeastern education is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]]. Founded in 2009, IDEA is Northeastern University's student-led Venture Accelerator, which provides entrepreneurs, including students, faculty, and alumni in the Northeastern community with the necessary support and educational experience towards developing a business from core concept to launch. Academics at Northeastern is grounded in a liberal arts education and the integration of classroom studies with [[experiential learning]] opportunities, including [[cooperative education]], student research, [[service learning]], and global experience, including [[study abroad]] and international co-op. The university's cooperative education program places about 5,000 students annually with more than 3,000 co-op employers in Boston, across the United States, and around the globe. In 2014, ''[[College Prowler]]'' gave Northeastern an \"A+\" rating for the quality of classes, professors, and overall academic environment.<ref name=\"collegeprowler\"/>\n\n=== Undergraduate class size ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These students are selected from the regular applicant pool with no separate application and represent the applicants with the highest GPA and SAT/ACT scores that year. The culminating experience is advanced specialty work in a major field through college-specific choices including specialized advanced honors seminars and an independent research project.<ref name=\"neu5\"/> In addition, students in the Honors Program exclusively can live in a Living-Learning Community housed in West Villages C<ref name=\"neu6\"/> and F. In Fall 2009, the university began housing first-year Honors students in the lower nine floors of the newly constructed International Village residence hall. Starting in Fall 2017, these students are housed in the lower floors of the even newer 17 story East Village residence hall. 2017 also marked the beginning of the Honors Discovery course and the introduction of the Student Assessed Integrated Learning (SAIL) app.<ref>{{cite web |title=SAIL, a new learning platform developed by Northeastern, helps students extract meaning from class, co-op, and everyday experiences |url=https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/02/28/sail-a-new-learning-platform-developed-by-northeastern-helps-students-extract-meaning-from-class-co-op-and-everyday-experiences/ |website=news.northeastern.edu |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Co-op/internship program===\nNortheastern has one of the largest [[cooperative education]] (co-op) programs in the world.<ref name=\"northeastern23\"/> Started in 1909, NU's co-op program is one of the oldest in the nation. In the co-op program, students alternate periods of academic study with periods of professional employment (usually paid) related to their major. Most majors offer a four-year graduation option with fewer co-op placements, but the five-year program is slightly more popular with students. Students on co-op do not pay tuition and students not living on campus do not pay room and board. The co-op program typically begins the spring of the second year or fall of the third year (after a more traditional program for the first semesters on campus). Students usually take anywhere between one and three with 96% participating in one and 78% participating in two or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/coop/students/faq/|title=FAQ \u2013 Cooperative Education and Career Development at Northeastern University|website=www.northeastern.edu|access-date=December 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCo-op placements range from small start-up companies to large multinational companies, including many [[Fortune 500]] corporations. The program also places students with government agencies, branches of government, nonprofits, and [[non-governmental organizations]]. Northeastern students can be found interning in the [[United States Congress]], the [[White House]], [[United Nations]], and at [[NASA]]. Student placements usually last six months and most of the time, students are paid. Students may live in the university residence halls on campus during co-op employment, and the university currently leases housing for students co-oping in New York City, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. and assists elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/coopconnections/beyond-boston/nu-leased-housing/|title=Northeastern University Leased Housing - Co-op Connections at Northeastern University|website=www.northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\nNortheastern co-op students staying in Boston usually benefit from the fact that the city's most prominent industries have numerous offices/headquarters there. Boston's most consequential industries such as its financial sector, technology sector, and medicine/life sciences sector tend to hire many co-ops in these fields especially to big-name companies. When it comes to D'amore-Mckim Business students, many co-ops end up working for large financial firms such as [[State Street Corporation|State Street]] and [[John Hancock Financial]]. Accounting firms such as [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (PwC) and [[Deloitte & Touche]] as well as consulting firms such as [[Boston Consulting Group]] tend to hire many co-ops every cycle as well. Retail companies like [[TJX Companies]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]] tend to hire several marketing students every cycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/coop-1pgr_mktg0417.pdf |title=Data |publisher=northeastern.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-10-19}}</ref>\n\nSome students also decide to develop their own co-ops if they wish to do something that is not offered. This usually involves starting a new company or reaching out to a company Northeastern does not have a partnership with and facilitating the creation of a co-op partnership. Many companies continually pass down their co-op opportunities to Northeastern students so these new partnerships are documented in Northeastern's co-op database, known as NUCareers, to be given to future Northeastern students. Students that decide to start their own companies are usually involved with IDEA, Northeastern's Venture Accelerator, and will sometimes spend their entire two or three co-ops solely developing their companies. They might also join the Husky Startup Challenge which also helps develop student-run companies. If a company is successful in either IDEA, the Husky Startup Challenge or both, they often to move onto [[MassChallenge]] in Boston which is a huge global non-profit startup accelerator and competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metromba.com/2013/06/northeasterns-venture-launching-organization-idea-holds-biannual-pitch-a-thon-at-masschallenge/|title=Northeastern\u2019s IDEA Accelerator Holds Biannual Pitch-a-thon at MassChallenge|date=June 18, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAll Northeastern students take at least one class which prepares them for their co-op and the expectations of a given industry. Some schools like D'amore-Mckim have students take three different one-credit classes to prepare them for their co-op. During these classes, students work with advisers inside and outside of class to pursue potential co-ops as well as work on strategies to make themselves more competitive against other candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cssh.northeastern.edu/experiential-learning/cooperative-education/students/faqs|title=Co-op FAQs|website=College of Social Sciences and Humanities}}</ref>\n\nThe co-op program has led to the university's high reputation when it comes to job placement. 50% of Northeastern students receive a job offer from a previous co-op employer {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.<ref name=\"northeastern.edu\"/> 92% were either employed or enrolled in graduate school 9 months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onlineschoolscenter.com/30-colleges-impressive-job-placement-rates-career-services/|title=30 Colleges with the Most Impressive Job Placement Rates and Career Services |website=Online Schools Center}}</ref> This has also led Northeastern to consistently rank within the top 5 in the Princeton Review's list for \"Best Career Services/Internships\" within the last decade, mainly taking the top spot. The list split into \"Best Career Services\" and \"Best Internships\" in 2016 and Northeastern currently ranks 3rd for career services and 5th for internships in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-career-services|title=Best Colleges for Career Services - The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-schools-for-internships|title=Best Schools for Internships|website=www.princetonreview.com}}</ref>\n\n===Senior Capstone===\nThe Senior Capstone is an advanced-level course related to the student's major. The course requires the student to integrate what they have learned through their academic coursework and their experiential learning experience (co-op, research, study abroad, and service).<ref name=\"Senior Capstone\"/><ref name=\"neu7\"/><ref name=\"neu8\"/><ref name=\"neu9\"/>\n\n===Pre-med program===\nThe university partnered with [[Tufts University School of Medicine]] to create an early-acceptance BA/MD Program.<ref name=\"neu10\"/> This program has been since discontinued. Northeastern's campus is just a few blocks from the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]] where [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]] are located along with their associated teaching hospitals.\n\n===Study abroad===\nNortheastern has semester-long study abroad programs with placements in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Some participating schools include: [[University of Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics]], England; [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Reims Management School]], France; [[European School of Business]], Germany; [[University of Cape Town]], South Africa; [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand; [[Swinburne University of Technology]], Australia; [[Obirin University]], Japan; [[American College of Thessaloniki]], Greece and [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]], Chile and also Antarctica.<ref name=\"neu11\"/>\n\nNortheastern's International Business program is a member of the International Partnership of Business Schools. Through this program International Business students have the opportunity to be awarded a dual-degree from Northeastern as well as from a sister school abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ipbs-network.org/partners/usa-northeastern-university/|title=USA \u2013 Northeastern University|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince the arrival of President Aoun in 2006, the school has also been emphasizing co-op abroad, in an effort to make the school more global and internationally engaged. There are many programs being offered including social entrepreneurship in the Peru, Kenya, and South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/sei/resources/cooperative-education/|title=Cooperative Education \u2013 Social Enterprise Institute at Northeastern University|website=www.northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialogues of Civilizations ===\nNortheastern also has the notable Dialogues of Civilizations program, which features dozens of one-month-long programs (usually taking place in the summer) where a faculty member will teach a group of students in a foreign country related to the curriculum of a specific class. A sort of \"mini\" study abroad, each program has an area of focus \u2013 for example, the Geneva program focuses on small arms and multilateral negotiations while the South Africa program is based in non-governmental organizations. This program is meant to be a communicative experience and an exchange of ideas and cultures. It is open to all majors and all years, and is the most popular study abroad option at Northeastern.{{citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nThe program is used by some Northeastern students to gain extra credits for a minor or concentration and can also be used by students trying to graduate in 4 years while also participating in one or more co-ops. The program will sometimes take place in multiple locations. Entrepreneurship and Global Consulting in Israel is a dialogue that starts in Boston and eventually has students go to Tel-Aviv and Beer Sheva, Israel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/geo/opportunity/new-venture-lab-abroad-israel-start-nation/|title=Entrepreneurship and Global Consulting in Israel \u2013 Global Experience Office (GEO) at Northeastern University|work=GEO|access-date=December 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Some dialogues span multiple countries with one being taught in [[Marrakesh, Morocco]], then in Amsterdam and concluding in Paris.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/geo/opportunity/colonial-past-cultural-change-and-economic-development/|title=Economic and Cultural Dynamics of Muslim Immigration \u2013 Global Experience Office (GEO) at Northeastern University|work=GEO|access-date=December 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== N.U.in ===\nIn addition to the Dialogues of Civilizations program, Northeastern also offers a program called \"N.U.in\", primarily for first-year students who choose to start their first semester studying abroad. This program accepts students into the university but has them spend their first semester studying at a foreign university partnered with Northeastern. Students take classes in English and these credits transfer over to Northeastern when they arrive on campus in the spring. The program began in 2007 with the creation of N.U.in Australia and only had the option for students to go abroad during their fall semester (before coming to the home campus in Boston). Now, students of any year can go on N.U.in during a fall or spring semester (however, the majority of those who complete the program, complete it their fall of freshman year). In 2008, Greece and England were added as options for N.U.in.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nSince the early 2010s, the program has started accepting students to the university, then selecting students to admit to the N.U.in program. The idea behind this is to bring students with more diverse experiences back to the Boston campus by presenting students motivated by travel with the opportunity to immediately study abroad. It is also used to introduce students, professors, and communities across the globe to Northeastern students which could help with the university's global presence. Northeastern's goals for global expansion are outlined in their Northeastern 2025 campaign stating \"Northeastern 2025 will build on the university's network of campuses around the world to create intercultural hubs for lifelong experiential learning: expanded study-abroad programs, international co-op opportunities, international dialogues, and coursework embedded with employer partners.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/academic-plan/plan/|title=Academic Plan: Northeastern 2025 \u2013 Academic Plan|author=|date=|website=northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\nBy 2012, 500 students enrolled in the N.U.in program which at the time offered the destinations of [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Thessaloniki]] ([[Greece]]), [[Sydney]], and [[San Jos\u00e9 (Costa Rica)|San Jos\u00e9]] ([[Costa Rica]]). By 2017 that number grew to 1,100 students and the program had expanded to [[Shanghai]], [[Rome]], [[Berlin]], [[Montreal]], [[Melbourne]], and removed San Jos\u00e9 as an N.U.in destination. Students in the N.U.in program study at some of the top college campuses around the world, including [[McGill University]] for N.U.in Canada students and the [[University of Sydney]] for N.U.in Australia students. For some locations including N.U.in Australia, N.U.in England, and N.U.in Ireland, Northeastern is partnered with two universities to give students more options of where they would like to study. As of 2019, N.U.in locations include Australia, Canada, England, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/nuin/|title=The N.U.in Program|author=|date=|website=northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\nResearch Centers and Institutes at Northeastern include:<ref name=\"Research at Northeastern\"/>\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Advanced [[scientific computing|Scientific Computation]] Center (ASCC)\n* [[Affective science|Affective Science]] Institute (ASI)\n* [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Anti]]\u2013[[Microorganism|microbial]] Discovery Center\n* [[Explosive detection|Awareness and Localization]] of [[Explosive material|Explosives]]-Related Threats (ALERT)\n* Barnett Institute of [[Chemical substance|Chemical]] and [[Biology|Biological]] Analysis<ref name=\"neu12\"/>\n* Bernard M.

It is categorized as an R1 institution (Doctoral Universities: Highest Research Activity) by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].<ref name=\"Carnegie\"/> The university offers undergraduate and graduate programs on its main campus in Boston. The university has satellite campuses in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Seattle, Washington]]; [[San Jose, California]]; [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Portland, Maine]] that exclusively offer graduate degrees. In 2019, Northeastern purchased the [[New College of the Humanities]] in [[London, England]].

While it is not required for students of all academic disciplines to participate in the co-op program, participation is nearly universal among undergraduate students as it helps distinguish their university experience from that of other universities. Northeastern also has a comprehensive [[study abroad]] program that spans more than 170 universities and colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/geo/opportunity/#/?type=study-abroad|title=Search Opportunity \u2013 Global Experience Office (GEO) at Northeastern University|website=GEO}}</ref>\n\nNortheastern is a large, highly residential university. Most students choose to live on campus but upperclassmen have the option to live off campus. More than 75% of Northeastern students receive some form of financial aid. In the 2019\u201320 school year, the university has committed $296.2&nbsp;million in grant and scholarship assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://provost.northeastern.edu/uds/facts/common-data-set/|title=Common Data Set|author=University Decision Support|date=|website=Northeastern University Provost|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe university's sports teams, the [[Northeastern Huskies]], compete in [[NCAA Division I]] as members of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] (CAA) in 18 varsity sports.

The School of Law was formally established that year with the assistance of an Advisory Committee, consisting of Dean James Barr Ames of the [[Harvard University]] School of Law, Dean Samuel Bennett of the [[Boston University]] School of Law, and Judge James R. Dunbar. In 1903, the first Automobile Engineering School in the country was established followed by the School of Commerce and Finance in 1907. Day classes began in 1909. In 1916, a bill was introduced into the Massachusetts Legislature to incorporate the institute as '''Northeastern College'''. After considerable debate and investigation, it was passed in March 1916.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Dictionary of University Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tntEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA304|author1=Mary Elizabeth Devine|author2=Carol Summerfield|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2 December 2013|page=304}}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1917, Frank Palmer Speare was inaugurated as the new College's first President. Five years later the school changed its name to '''Northeastern University''' to better reflect the increasing depth of its instruction.<ref name=\"History\"/> In March 1923, the University secured general degree-granting power from the Legislature, with the exception of the A.B., the S.B.,{{clarify|date=January 2015}}<!-- What undergraduate degrees were offered if neither Bachelors of Arts (Artium Baccalaureus) or Science (Scienti\u00e6 Baccalaureus) were? --> and the medical degrees.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe College of Liberal Arts was added in 1935. Two years later the Northeastern University Corporation was established, with a board of trustees composed of 31 University members and 8 from the [[YMCA]]. In 1948 Northeastern separated itself completely from the YMCA.<ref name=\"northeastern\"/>\n\nFollowing World War II Northeastern began admitting women. During the postwar educational boom, the University created the College of Education (1953), University College (now called the College of Professional Studies) (1960),<ref name=\"neu1\"/> and the Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing (1964) (later combined into the Bouv\u00e9 College of Health Sciences). The College of Criminal Justice (1967) followed, then the College of Computer Science (1982).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBy the early 1980s the one-time night commuter school had grown to nearly 50,000 enrollees including all full- and part-time programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level. By 1989\u20131990 University enrollment had reduced to about 40,000 full, part-time, and evening students, and in 1990 the first class with more live-on-campus than commuter students was graduated. Following the retirement of President Kenneth Ryder 1989, the University adopted a slow and more thoughtful approach to change. Historically, it had been accepting between 7,500 and 10,000 students per year based on applications of about 15,000 to 20,000 with acceptance rates between 50% and 75% depending on the program. Attrition rates were huge, with a 25% freshmen dropout rate and graduation rate below 50%, with only 40% <!-- 2,287 --> of 5,672 undergraduate full-time day students enrolled in the Fall of 1984 graduating by 1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhen President John Curry left office in 1996 the university population had been systematically reduced to about 25,000. Incoming President Richard Freeland decided to focus on recruiting the type of students who were already graduating as the school's prime demographic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the early 1990s, the university cut its freshman class size from around 4,500 students to 2,800 in order to become more selective and began a $485&nbsp;million construction program that included residence halls, academic and research facilities, and athletic centers. Between 1996 and 2006 average SAT scores increased more than 200 points, retention rates rose dramatically, and applications doubled.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n[[File:Northeastern Shillman Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Robert J.

Freeland stepped down on August 15, 2006 and was replaced by Dr. [[Joseph Aoun]], a former [[dean (education)|dean]] at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref name=\"boston\"/> Aoun implemented a decentralized management model, giving university deans more control over their budgets, faculty hiring decisions, and fundraising.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[File:NEU Ell Hall.jpg|thumb|Northeastern's historic [[Carl Stephens Ell|Ell Hall]] on Huntington Avenue.]]\nAs part of a five-year, $75&nbsp;million Academic Investment Plan that ran from 2004 and 2009<ref name=\"neu2\"/> the University concentrated on undergraduate education, core graduate professional programs, and centers of research excellence. Faculty was originally to be bolstered by 100 new tenured and tenure-track professors, later expanded to include 300 additional tenure and tenure-track faculty in interdisciplinary fields. Aoun also placed more emphasis on improving community relations by reaching out to leaders of the neighborhoods surrounding the university.<ref name=\"boston3\"/> In addition, Aoun has created more academic partnerships with other institutions in the Boston area, including [[Tufts]], [[Hebrew College]] and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts]].{{citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nDuring this time, Northeastern has advanced in national rankings.

Some have argued that Northeastern's recent rise in the rankings shows that the university has \"cracked the code\" to academic rankings, while others have suggested that it has figured out how to \"game the system\".<ref name=Cracked>{{citation |url=http://www.wbur.org/2014/09/09/northeastern-college-ranking-system/|title=How Northeastern Cracked the Code to the U.S. News College Ranking System|publisher=National Public Radio|author=Oakes, Bob|date=September 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Gamed>{{citation |url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/08/26/how-northeastern-gamed-the-college-rankings/|title=How to Game the College Rankings|publisher=Boston Magazine |author=Kutner, Max|date=September 2014}}</ref> The 2018 edition of ''U.S. News & World Report'' ranked Northeastern 40th in its annual ranking of National Universities.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhether the rise of Northeastern's ranking was the result of an effort to game the system or not, critics would agree that the institution's continual improvements in its placement in ''U.S. News & World Report'''s \"Best Colleges Guide\" allowed the university to improve rapidly via a significantly larger endowment and a more-competitive student body. This explains why it was able to attain higher rankings than other local schools such as [[Simmons College]] and [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]] (which were started around the same time). Northeastern's reputation benefited from a positive feedback effect, in that improved rankings gave the university access to more resources which in turn allowed them to further improve the quality of the university and therefore their rankings. The quality of the university has improved dramatically within the last two decades as a result of the introduction of new academic programs, far more competitive applicants, new buildings, a larger endowment, alumni donations, new satellite campuses, and the expansion of their flagship Co-op program.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nMore recently the University has continued to focus on global expansion. In late 2018, Northeastern University announced the acquisition of the [[New College of the Humanities]], a small private London-based college founded by the philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]].

These students are selected from the regular applicant pool with no separate application and represent the applicants with the highest GPA and SAT/ACT scores that year. The culminating experience is advanced specialty work in a major field through college-specific choices including specialized advanced honors seminars and an independent research project.<ref name=\"neu5\"/> In addition, students in the Honors Program exclusively can live in a Living-Learning Community housed in West Villages C<ref name=\"neu6\"/> and F. In Fall 2009, the university began housing first-year Honors students in the lower nine floors of the newly constructed International Village residence hall. Starting in Fall 2017, these students are housed in the lower floors of the even newer 17 story East Village residence hall. 2017 also marked the beginning of the Honors Discovery course and the introduction of the Student Assessed Integrated Learning (SAIL) app.<ref>{{cite web |title=SAIL, a new learning platform developed by Northeastern, helps students extract meaning from class, co-op, and everyday experiences |url=https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/02/28/sail-a-new-learning-platform-developed-by-northeastern-helps-students-extract-meaning-from-class-co-op-and-everyday-experiences/ |website=news.northeastern.edu |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Co-op/internship program===\nNortheastern has one of the largest [[cooperative education]] (co-op) programs in the world.<ref name=\"northeastern23\"/> Started in 1909, NU's co-op program is one of the oldest in the nation. In the co-op program, students alternate periods of academic study with periods of professional employment (usually paid) related to their major. Most majors offer a four-year graduation option with fewer co-op placements, but the five-year program is slightly more popular with students. Students on co-op do not pay tuition and students not living on campus do not pay room and board. The co-op program typically begins the spring of the second year or fall of the third year (after a more traditional program for the first semesters on campus). Students usually take anywhere between one and three with 96% participating in one and 78% participating in two or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/coop/students/faq/|title=FAQ \u2013 Cooperative Education and Career Development at Northeastern University|website=www.northeastern.edu|access-date=December 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCo-op placements range from small start-up companies to large multinational companies, including many [[Fortune 500]] corporations. The program also places students with government agencies, branches of government, nonprofits, and [[non-governmental organizations]]. Northeastern students can be found interning in the [[United States Congress]], the [[White House]], [[United Nations]], and at [[NASA]]. Student placements usually last six months and most of the time, students are paid. Students may live in the university residence halls on campus during co-op employment, and the university currently leases housing for students co-oping in New York City, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. and assists elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/coopconnections/beyond-boston/nu-leased-housing/|title=Northeastern University Leased Housing - Co-op Connections at Northeastern University|website=www.northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\nNortheastern co-op students staying in Boston usually benefit from the fact that the city's most prominent industries have numerous offices/headquarters there. Boston's most consequential industries such as its financial sector, technology sector, and medicine/life sciences sector tend to hire many co-ops in these fields especially to big-name companies. When it comes to D'amore-Mckim Business students, many co-ops end up working for large financial firms such as [[State Street Corporation|State Street]] and [[John Hancock Financial]]. Accounting firms such as [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (PwC) and [[Deloitte & Touche]] as well as consulting firms such as [[Boston Consulting Group]] tend to hire many co-ops every cycle as well. Retail companies like [[TJX Companies]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]] tend to hire several marketing students every cycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/coop-1pgr_mktg0417.pdf |title=Data |publisher=northeastern.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-10-19}}</ref>\n\nSome students also decide to develop their own co-ops if they wish to do something that is not offered. This usually involves starting a new company or reaching out to a company Northeastern does not have a partnership with and facilitating the creation of a co-op partnership. Many companies continually pass down their co-op opportunities to Northeastern students so these new partnerships are documented in Northeastern's co-op database, known as NUCareers, to be given to future Northeastern students. Students that decide to start their own companies are usually involved with IDEA, Northeastern's Venture Accelerator, and will sometimes spend their entire two or three co-ops solely developing their companies. They might also join the Husky Startup Challenge which also helps develop student-run companies. If a company is successful in either IDEA, the Husky Startup Challenge or both, they often to move onto [[MassChallenge]] in Boston which is a huge global non-profit startup accelerator and competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metromba.com/2013/06/northeasterns-venture-launching-organization-idea-holds-biannual-pitch-a-thon-at-masschallenge/|title=Northeastern\u2019s IDEA Accelerator Holds Biannual Pitch-a-thon at MassChallenge|date=June 18, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAll Northeastern students take at least one class which prepares them for their co-op and the expectations of a given industry. Some schools like D'amore-Mckim have students take three different one-credit classes to prepare them for their co-op. During these classes, students work with advisers inside and outside of class to pursue potential co-ops as well as work on strategies to make themselves more competitive against other candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cssh.northeastern.edu/experiential-learning/cooperative-education/students/faqs|title=Co-op FAQs|website=College of Social Sciences and Humanities}}</ref>\n\nThe co-op program has led to the university's high reputation when it comes to job placement. 50% of Northeastern students receive a job offer from a previous co-op employer {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.<ref name=\"northeastern.edu\"/> 92% were either employed or enrolled in graduate school 9 months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onlineschoolscenter.com/30-colleges-impressive-job-placement-rates-career-services/|title=30 Colleges with the Most Impressive Job Placement Rates and Career Services |website=Online Schools Center}}</ref> This has also led Northeastern to consistently rank within the top 5 in the Princeton Review's list for \"Best Career Services/Internships\" within the last decade, mainly taking the top spot. The list split into \"Best Career Services\" and \"Best Internships\" in 2016 and Northeastern currently ranks 3rd for career services and 5th for internships in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-career-services|title=Best Colleges for Career Services - The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-schools-for-internships|title=Best Schools for Internships|website=www.princetonreview.com}}</ref>\n\n===Senior Capstone===\nThe Senior Capstone is an advanced-level course related to the student's major. The course requires the student to integrate what they have learned through their academic coursework and their experiential learning experience (co-op, research, study abroad, and service).<ref name=\"Senior Capstone\"/><ref name=\"neu7\"/><ref name=\"neu8\"/><ref name=\"neu9\"/>\n\n===Pre-med program===\nThe university partnered with [[Tufts University School of Medicine]] to create an early-acceptance BA/MD Program.<ref name=\"neu10\"/> This program has been since discontinued. Northeastern's campus is just a few blocks from the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]] where [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]] are located along with their associated teaching hospitals.\n\n===Study abroad===\nNortheastern has semester-long study abroad programs with placements in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Some participating schools include: [[University of Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics]], England; [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Reims Management School]], France; [[European School of Business]], Germany; [[University of Cape Town]], South Africa; [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand; [[Swinburne University of Technology]], Australia; [[Obirin University]], Japan; [[American College of Thessaloniki]], Greece and [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]], Chile and also Antarctica.<ref name=\"neu11\"/>\n\nNortheastern's International Business program is a member of the International Partnership of Business Schools. Through this program International Business students have the opportunity to be awarded a dual-degree from Northeastern as well as from a sister school abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ipbs-network.org/partners/usa-northeastern-university/|title=USA \u2013 Northeastern University|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince the arrival of President Aoun in 2006, the school has also been emphasizing co-op abroad, in an effort to make the school more global and internationally engaged. There are many programs being offered including social entrepreneurship in the Peru, Kenya, and South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/sei/resources/cooperative-education/|title=Cooperative Education \u2013 Social Enterprise Institute at Northeastern University|website=www.northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialogues of Civilizations ===\nNortheastern also has the notable Dialogues of Civilizations program, which features dozens of one-month-long programs (usually taking place in the summer) where a faculty member will teach a group of students in a foreign country related to the curriculum of a specific class. A sort of \"mini\" study abroad, each program has an area of focus \u2013 for example, the Geneva program focuses on small arms and multilateral negotiations while the South Africa program is based in non-governmental organizations. This program is meant to be a communicative experience and an exchange of ideas and cultures. It is open to all majors and all years, and is the most popular study abroad option at Northeastern.{{citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nThe program is used by some Northeastern students to gain extra credits for a minor or concentration and can also be used by students trying to graduate in 4 years while also participating in one or more co-ops. The program will sometimes take place in multiple locations. Entrepreneurship and Global Consulting in Israel is a dialogue that starts in Boston and eventually has students go to Tel-Aviv and Beer Sheva, Israel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/geo/opportunity/new-venture-lab-abroad-israel-start-nation/|title=Entrepreneurship and Global Consulting in Israel \u2013 Global Experience Office (GEO) at Northeastern University|work=GEO|access-date=December 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Some dialogues span multiple countries with one being taught in [[Marrakesh, Morocco]], then in Amsterdam and concluding in Paris.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/geo/opportunity/colonial-past-cultural-change-and-economic-development/|title=Economic and Cultural Dynamics of Muslim Immigration \u2013 Global Experience Office (GEO) at Northeastern University|work=GEO|access-date=December 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== N.U.in ===\nIn addition to the Dialogues of Civilizations program, Northeastern also offers a program called \"N.U.in\", primarily for first-year students who choose to start their first semester studying abroad. This program accepts students into the university but has them spend their first semester studying at a foreign university partnered with Northeastern. Students take classes in English and these credits transfer over to Northeastern when they arrive on campus in the spring. The program began in 2007 with the creation of N.U.in Australia and only had the option for students to go abroad during their fall semester (before coming to the home campus in Boston). Now, students of any year can go on N.U.in during a fall or spring semester (however, the majority of those who complete the program, complete it their fall of freshman year). In 2008, Greece and England were added as options for N.U.in.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nSince the early 2010s, the program has started accepting students to the university, then selecting students to admit to the N.U.in program. The idea behind this is to bring students with more diverse experiences back to the Boston campus by presenting students motivated by travel with the opportunity to immediately study abroad. It is also used to introduce students, professors, and communities across the globe to Northeastern students which could help with the university's global presence. Northeastern's goals for global expansion are outlined in their Northeastern 2025 campaign stating \"Northeastern 2025 will build on the university's network of campuses around the world to create intercultural hubs for lifelong experiential learning: expanded study-abroad programs, international co-op opportunities, international dialogues, and coursework embedded with employer partners.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/academic-plan/plan/|title=Academic Plan: Northeastern 2025 \u2013 Academic Plan|author=|date=|website=northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\nBy 2012, 500 students enrolled in the N.U.in program which at the time offered the destinations of [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Thessaloniki]] ([[Greece]]), [[Sydney]], and [[San Jos\u00e9 (Costa Rica)|San Jos\u00e9]] ([[Costa Rica]]). By 2017 that number grew to 1,100 students and the program had expanded to [[Shanghai]], [[Rome]], [[Berlin]], [[Montreal]], [[Melbourne]], and removed San Jos\u00e9 as an N.U.in destination. Students in the N.U.in program study at some of the top college campuses around the world, including [[McGill University]] for N.U.in Canada students and the [[University of Sydney]] for N.U.in Australia students. For some locations including N.U.in Australia, N.U.in England, and N.U.in Ireland, Northeastern is partnered with two universities to give students more options of where they would like to study. As of 2019, N.U.in locations include Australia, Canada, England, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northeastern.edu/nuin/|title=The N.U.in Program|author=|date=|website=northeastern.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\nResearch Centers and Institutes at Northeastern include:<ref name=\"Research at Northeastern\"/>\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Advanced [[scientific computing|Scientific Computation]] Center (ASCC)\n* [[Affective science|Affective Science]] Institute (ASI)\n* [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Anti]]\u2013[[Microorganism|microbial]] Discovery Center\n* [[Explosive detection|Awareness and Localization]] of [[Explosive material|Explosives]]-Related Threats (ALERT)\n* Barnett Institute of [[Chemical substance|Chemical]] and [[Biology|Biological]] Analysis<ref name=\"neu12\"/>\n* Bernard M.

The second award is named the Eberly award after Glen and Dan Eberly who were goalies at Northeastern and Boston University. In addition to winning the Beanpot title, Northeastern took home both awards with the award for most valuable player being presented to [[Adam Gaudette]] and the Eberly Award being presented to [[Cayden Primeau]] who had a save percentage of .974 (making him the goalie with second highest save percentage to win the award in the 44 years the award has been given).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2018/02/13/beanpot-northeastern-adam-gaudette-1988|title=Gaudette nets hat trick as Northeastern wins Beanpot|author=|date=|website=si.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Northeastern Crew team consistently ranks as one of the top 10 teams in the nation.<ref name=\"gonu\"/> In the 2008 National Championship, the team made the Grand Finals and placed fourth behind [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], [[University of Washington]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]], while beating [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"gonu24\"/>\n\nNortheastern offers 40 club sports, including [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], [[judo]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[lacrosse]], Olympic-Style [[taekwondo]], [[Northeastern Huskies alpine ski team|alpine skiing]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[cycling]] and [[ultimate frisbee]].

The college was established in 1847 by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and has a strong focus on Quaker values such as integrity, a commitment to peace and social justice, mutual respect, and community decision-making. It is primarily a residential undergraduate college but it offers a [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] and has an affiliated graduate seminary, the [[Earlham School of Religion]], which offers three master's degrees: a [[Master of Divinity]], Master of Ministry, and [[Master of Arts in Religion]].\n\n==History==\nEarlham was founded in 1847 as a boarding high school for the religious education of Quaker adolescents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/about/history|title=A Brief History of Earlham College|publisher=Earlham.edu|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> In 1859, Earlham became Earlham College, upon the addition of collegiate academics. At this time, Earlham was the third Quaker college in the [[United States]] ([[Haverford College]] was first, [[Guilford College]] the second), and the second U.S. institution of higher education to be coeducational ([[Oberlin College]] was first). Though the college initially only admitted students who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, Earlham began admitting non-Quakers in 1865. The college was named for [[Earlham Hall]], home of the [[Joseph John Gurney|Gurneys]], an important English Quaker family.\n\nOver time, as Quakerism in America became more progressive, Earlham's practices changed with them, though the college has remained faithful to its Quaker roots. In 1942 Earlham enrolled several dozen Japanese-American students to prevent their [[Japanese American internment|internment]] during [[World War II]], a decision that was very controversial in Richmond. 1960 marked the establishment of the [[Earlham School of Religion]], then the only Friends [[seminary]] in the world.\n\nEarlham College has been facing declining revenues for years.<ref name=\"pal-item.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/08/09/amid-financial-strains-earlham-banks-100-million-campus-updates/885145002/|title=Amid financial strains, Earlham puts $100 million into campus updates|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/07/29/earlham-faces-big-questions-deficit-ahead-new-school-year/828182002/|title=Earlham College faces big deficit, questions ahead of new school year|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref name=\"pal-item.com\"/>\n\n==Campus==\nEarlham's {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus lies at the southwestern edge of [[Richmond, Indiana]], a city of 36,812 (2010 census).

Since 2015, themed ecotours were founded and visitors can register for these outings to the school's properties of natural areas led by biology students for interpretation. The majority of Earlham College's campus is undeveloped [[forest]] and [[meadow]], including the undeveloped \"back campus\" area, which serves as an outdoor [[classroom]].

Students have taken ice climbing, dog sledding, caving, white water kayaking, rock climbing, trail construction and canoeing courses for credit. The program in the past has led spring break canoeing trips to  [[Big Bend National Park]] in southwestern [[Texas]], a semester course to  New Zealand and a  May Term (a condensed three-week term after the spring semester) instructor training  course for its August Wilderness program. Challenge/experiential education courses on the college's own high and low ropes is offered as well as the chance to be certified as a Wilderness First Responders in an intensive spring break course where students must complete mock rescues.

The college was established in 1847 by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and has a strong focus on Quaker values such as integrity, a commitment to peace and social justice, mutual respect, and community decision-making. It is primarily a residential undergraduate college but it offers a [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] and has an affiliated graduate seminary, the [[Earlham School of Religion]], which offers three master's degrees: a [[Master of Divinity]], Master of Ministry, and [[Master of Arts in Religion]].\n\n==History==\nEarlham was founded in 1847 as a boarding high school for the religious education of Quaker adolescents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/about/history|title=A Brief History of Earlham College|publisher=Earlham.edu|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> In 1859, Earlham became Earlham College, upon the addition of collegiate academics. At this time, Earlham was the third Quaker college in the [[United States]] ([[Haverford College]] was first, [[Guilford College]] the second), and the second U.S. institution of higher education to be coeducational ([[Oberlin College]] was first). Though the college initially only admitted students who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, Earlham began admitting non-Quakers in 1865. The college was named for [[Earlham Hall]], home of the [[Joseph John Gurney|Gurneys]], an important English Quaker family.\n\nOver time, as Quakerism in America became more progressive, Earlham's practices changed with them, though the college has remained faithful to its Quaker roots. In 1942 Earlham enrolled several dozen Japanese-American students to prevent their [[Japanese American internment|internment]] during [[World War II]], a decision that was very controversial in Richmond. 1960 marked the establishment of the [[Earlham School of Religion]], then the only Friends [[seminary]] in the world.\n\nEarlham College has been facing declining revenues for years.<ref name=\"pal-item.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/08/09/amid-financial-strains-earlham-banks-100-million-campus-updates/885145002/|title=Amid financial strains, Earlham puts $100 million into campus updates|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/07/29/earlham-faces-big-questions-deficit-ahead-new-school-year/828182002/|title=Earlham College faces big deficit, questions ahead of new school year|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref name=\"pal-item.com\"/>\n\n==Campus==\nEarlham's {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus lies at the southwestern edge of [[Richmond, Indiana]], a city of 36,812 (2010 census).

Tibetan, Creole, and Kiswalli have been offered during some of these off campus programs.\n\nIn the sciences, Earlham places a large emphasis on integrating research into the undergraduate curriculum. Through Ford/Knight grants, most science faculty have been or are currently involved with students in research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/curriculum-guide/elective-opportunities/studentfaculty-research|title=Student/Faculty Research|accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref> Earlham has good representation in the [[Butler University|Butler]] Undergraduate Research Conference, held each year in the spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.butler.edu/media/1196327/program2011_rev.pdf|title=2011 Butler Undergraduate Research Conference Schedule|access-date=2011-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406090728/http://www.butler.edu/media/1196327/program2011_rev.pdf|archive-date=2012-04-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[pre-medicine]] program is particularly distinguished, in that over the last ten years all but one of its graduates have been accepted into medical school. Earlham's biology and chemistry departments have a long history of producing distinguished graduates, such as [[Warder Clyde Allee]], [[Jim Fowler]], [[Larry E. Overman]], [[Harold Urey]], and [[Wendell Stanley]], the latter two of which won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (in 1934 and 1946, respectively). Students and Faculty in Earlham's CS applied groups jointly provide computer infrastructure support for the college.\n\nThe [[choir]] department organizes regional and national tours every year for its ensembles. In January 2012, the concert choir performed in [[Indianapolis]], the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], and [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/music/midwest-choir-tour|title=Midwest Choir Tour|publisher=Earlham.edu|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref> The choral and instrumental music departments collaborate on a biennial basis, performing works such as [[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]] and [[Michael Tippett|Michael Tippett's]] [[A Child of Our Time]]. The College has a full [[Gamelan]] ensemble, which performs concerts in the Spring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instrumental Music|url=http://www.earlham.edu/music/instrumental-music|publisher=Earlham College|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> Earlham has an entirely student-managed public [[radio station]], [[WECI]] 91.5FM. In addition, 6-10 theater performances occur throughout the year on campus through either the academic department, senior projects or the student company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weciradio.org/ |title=WECI 91.5FM Richmond Public Radio |publisher=Weciradio.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://earlham.edu/theatre-arts/|title=Theatre Arts, Academics - Earlham College|website=earlham.edu|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarlham has students from 77 countries, the most out of any liberal arts college in the United States. This equates to roughly 200 students, which is the highest total number of international students for any co-educational liberal arts college in the country. This high diversity is due in part to a strong relationship with the [[United World College]] network of international boarding high schools. Since 2004, Earlham College has been a part of the Davis United World Scholars program, which offers need-based scholarships for UWC graduates to continue their education at select institutions in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/alumni/whats-happening/news/?id=13468&r=3867|title=Earlham Joins Worldwide 50th Anniversary Celebration for United World Colleges|publisher=earlham.edu|accessdate=2013-02-17}}</ref> The Davis Cup, which is awarded to the college with the most current students from this program, has been awarded to Earlham several times. The college also draws from all regions of the United States, with students from 42 states. Domestic minorities represent 15% of the student body.<ref name=\"earlham.edu\"/>\n\nEarlham is orienting some of the curriculum around exploring local and global problems as well as possible solutions.  In 2016, Earlham students won the million dollar [[Hult Prize]] for their \"Magic Bus\" proposal to help with transportation problems in developing urban environments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/09/26/495466938/a-million-dollars-goes-to-an-app-that-leads-to-a-better-bus-commute |title=$1 Million Goes To An App That Leads To A Better Bus Commute |first=Angus |last=Chen |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=September 26, 2016 |accessdate=October 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarlham has the United States' only [[equestrianism|Equestrian]] program which is run entirely by students. Lessons are available for students of the college and community members. The equestrian center is adjacent to the college owned 11 acre Miller farm which hosts agricultural interns during the school year and summer and \"work days\" on Saturdays for the rest of the community during the school year.

Students report an average of 23,000 hours of volunteering work every year and Earlham's Bonner program offers financial aid in exchange for volunteering work for students with high financial need.<ref name=\"earlham.edu\"/>\n\nEarlham College is a member of the [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]].\n\n== Adjacent institutions ==\nThere are two institutions located adjacent to the Earlham College undergraduate campus: [[Earlham School of Religion]], a Quaker theological graduate school, and [[Bethany Theological Seminary]], an independent [[Church of the Brethren]] institution offering graduate and non-degree programs. Earlham College students can take courses at these institutions (which share facilities with the college).\n\nWhile Earlham is predominately an undergraduate institution, it also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earlham.edu/master-of-arts-in-teaching/|title=Master of Arts in Teaching |publisher=earlham.edu|accessdate=2016-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\nEarlham competes in NCAA Division III and in the [[Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference]].

The program is divided into the Water August Wilderness and the Mountain August Wilderness and lasts for approximately three weeks; the former canoes in [[Wabakimi Provincial Park]] in Ontario and the latter hikes in the Uinta Mountains in Utah. Students have taken ice climbing, dog sledding, caving, white water kayaking, rock climbing, trail construction and canoeing courses for credit. The program in the past has led spring break canoeing trips to  [[Big Bend National Park]] in southwestern [[Texas]], a semester course to  New Zealand and a  May Term (a condensed three-week term after the spring semester) instructor training  course for its August Wilderness program. Challenge/experiential education courses on the college's own high and low ropes is offered as well as the chance to be certified as a Wilderness First Responders in an intensive spring break course where students must complete mock rescues. In the past students have also had the opportunity to rappel off the College's three-story science building.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of Earlham College people}}\n\n*[[Michael Shellenberger]]\n*[[Michael C.

[[Iowa]] voters elected state senators in 32 of the state senate's 50 districts--all 25 of the even-numbered seats were up for regularly-scheduled elections and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], seven of the odd-numbered seats were up as well. State senators serve four-year terms in the [[Iowa State Senate]], with half of the seats ''traditionally'' up for election each cycle.\n\nThe [[Iowa General Assembly]] provides statewide maps of each district. To compare the effect of the 1991 redistricting process on the location of each district, contrast the [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924975.pdf previous map] with the [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924977.pdf map used for 1992 elections].\n\nThe primary election on June 2, 1992 determined which candidates appeared on the November 3, 1992 general election ballot.

On December 17, 1991 a special election in [[Iowa Senate, District 44|district 44]] resulted in [[Albert Sorensen]] flipping a seat in favor of the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]]. Therefore, on election day in November 1992, [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] controlled 29 seats and [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] had 21.\n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]], the [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] needed to net 5 Senate seats. \n\n[[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] maintained control of the [[Iowa State Senate]] following the 1992 general election with the balance of power shifting to [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] holding 27 seats and [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] having 23 seats (a net gain of 2 seats for the Republicans). \n\n==Summary of Results==\n*NOTE: Most of the 25 odd-numbered districts did not have elections in 1992 so they are not listed here.\n*Also note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting. \n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! class=\"unsortable\"| [[Iowa State Senate|State Senate]] District\n! class=\"unsortable\"|[[Incumbent]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| [[Iowa Senate, District 2|2nd]]\n| Donald V.

[[Iowa]] voters elected state senators in 32 of the state senate's 50 districts--all 25 of the even-numbered seats were up for regularly-scheduled elections and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], seven of the odd-numbered seats were up as well. State senators serve four-year terms in the [[Iowa State Senate]], with half of the seats ''traditionally'' up for election each cycle.\n\nThe [[Iowa General Assembly]] provides statewide maps of each district. To compare the effect of the 1991 redistricting process on the location of each district, contrast the [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924975.pdf previous map] with the [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924977.pdf map used for 1992 elections].\n\nThe primary election on June 2, 1992 determined which candidates appeared on the November 3, 1992 general election ballot.

On December 17, 1991 a special election in [[Iowa Senate, District 44|district 44]] resulted in [[Albert Sorensen]] flipping a seat in favor of the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]]. Therefore, on election day in November 1992, [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] controlled 29 seats and [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] had 21.\n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]], the [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] needed to net 5 Senate seats. \n\n[[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] maintained control of the [[Iowa State Senate]] following the 1992 general election with the balance of power shifting to [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] holding 27 seats and [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] having 23 seats (a net gain of 2 seats for the Republicans). \n\n==Summary of Results==\n*NOTE: Most of the 25 odd-numbered districts did not have elections in 1992 so they are not listed here.\n*Also note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting. \n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! class=\"unsortable\"| [[Iowa State Senate|State Senate]] District\n! class=\"unsortable\"|[[Incumbent]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| [[Iowa Senate, District 2|2nd]]\n| Donald V.
