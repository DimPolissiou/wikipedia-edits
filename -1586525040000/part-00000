It lies on one of the main access routes between [[Transylvania]] and [[Wallachia]], at the north entrance of the Olt River Gorge; the [[European route]] E81 passes through it. The town administers two villages:\n*Colonia T\u0103lmaciu (''Feltrinellitelep''), three km towards the north\n*T\u0103lm\u0103cel (''Kistalm\u00e1cs''), three km towards the west\n\nIt also administered four other villages until 2004, when they were split off to form [[Boi\u021ba]] Commune.\n\n==History==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1992 |9369\n|2002 |9147\n|2011 |6527\n}}\n\nThe first documents referring to T\u0103lmaciu (Tholmach) are from 1318.\nAfter the Saxon colonisation of Transylvania, T\u0103lmaciu was the administrative center for the settlements of T\u0103lm\u0103cel, Boi\u021ba, Turnul Ro\u0219u, Racovi\u021ba, Sebe\u0219ul de Jos, and Plopi.\nAfter 1453 the administrative center was moved to Sibiu.\nIn 1987 T\u0103lmaciu was granted town status.\n\nBecause using the Olt pass to the south requires passing through T\u0103lmaciu, it has witnessed numerous historical events:\n\n* The Romans passed through during the battles between the troops of Emperor [[Trajan]] and King [[Decebalus]] of [[Dacia]].\n* 1599: [[Michael the Brave|Mihai Viteazu]]'s troops regrouped here before the [[battle of \u0218elimb\u0103r]].\n* 1848: the [[Russian Empire|Czarist]] troops battled [[J\u00f3zef Bem|General Bem]]'s army.\n* 1916: the Romanian Army used the town to stage the battle for Sibiu.\n\n===Capital of Romanian-occupied Transylvania (16 - 28 September 1916)===\nOn 27 August 1916, Romania entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], launching an [[Battle of Transylvania|invasion]] of [[Transylvania]].

The Beatles sent Alistair Taylor back to London to handle the purchase of the island. Alistair received permission from the Greek government to purchase the island, and \u00a390,000 of special \"export dollars\" required for the transaction were purchased. However, the Beatles changed their minds before the deal went through, and the export dollars were sold for a \u00a311,400 profit a few months later when exchange rates went up (one of the few profitable business ventures for the Beatles).<ref> [https://www.beatlesbible.com/1967/07/26/beatles-visit-greek-island/ \"The Beatles visit a Greek island they intended to purchase\"], ''[[The Beatles Bible]]''.

The Shah was one of the first people interested in the customised bullet-proof cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas\u2019 companies.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/>\n\nIn 1974, Mardas held an expensive party for the then heir to the throne of Spain, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Prince Juan Carlos]]; this secured Mardas a contract. After the assassination of [[Luis Carrero Blanco|Admiral Carrero Blanco]] the Spanish royal family thought it ought to acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it was parked in [[Chobham]] for almost a year as nobody knew how to do the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over \u00a31/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of \"Project Alcom\") in St Albans Mews off [[Edgware Road, London]], to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/> Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/>\n[[Image:450SELI 0411.jpg|250px|right|thumb|North American\u2013spec Mercedes-Benz 1978 450SEL 6.9]]\n[[Qaboos of Oman|The Sultan of Oman]] ordered six [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|Mercedes 450]] limousines in 1977, but quickly discovered that they were not as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-[[Special Air Service|SAS]] bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing guns at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which caused the fuel tank to explode, destroying the entire car.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/> The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/>\nKing Hussein of Jordan had a fleet of cars that Mardas customised, but carried out a safety test on them with live ammunition in November 1977. One eyewitness reported that the cars could be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the armour-plating, and the thick armoured glass broke into jagged splinters when struck. Hussein ordered that the cars be restored to their previous state.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/> These failures convinced Mardas and Constantine to look at the growing European market for anti-terrorist protection, setting up a factory in London to produce \"bullet-proof\" cars in 1978. This was financed by an investment of over \u00a31 million through anonymous [[Monaco|Monegasque]] and Swiss bank accounts, which were believed to be controlled by the Shah.<ref name=\"CampbellNewStatesman3August1979\"/>\n\n==The media and the courts==\nOn 28 February 1988, ''[[The Observer]]'' published an article naming Mardas as an arms dealer, but printed an apology on 30 April 1989.<ref name=\"StatementbyMardas\" /> After an article on 18 September 1988 (\"Joan's Secret Lover\"), and another a week later, ''[[The People]]'' newspaper was taken to court by Mardas, who won \u00a375,000 in damages.<ref name=\"StatementbyMardas\" /> The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' published an apology and gave an undisclosed sum in damages on 16 January 2004, after an article on 11 June 2003, which accused Mardas of dealings that would later resurface in his claim against ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008.<ref name=\"StatementbyMardas\" />\n\n''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper apologised on 21 August 2006, writing that on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas had not been a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and had not been fired, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas \"did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a 'sonic force field' or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas.
