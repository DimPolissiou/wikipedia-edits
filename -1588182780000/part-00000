A member of the [[Theridiidae]] family, this genus contains 32 [[species]],<ref name=WSC_sl3502/> which include several North American \"Black Widows\" (Southern Black Widow ''[[Latrodectus mactans]]'', Western Black Widow ''[[Latrodectus hesperus]]'', and Northern Black Widow ''[[Latrodectus variolus]]''). In addition to these in North America are also the Red Widow ''[[Latrodectus bishopi]]'' and the Brown Widow ''[[Latrodectus geometricus]]'', which, in addition to North America, has a much wider geographic distribution. Elsewhere, others include the [[European black widow]] (''Latrodectus tredecimguttatus''), the Australian [[Redback spider|Redback Black Widow]] (''Latrodectus hasseltii''), several different species in Southern Africa that can be called [[Button spider]]s, and the South American black widow spiders (''[[Latrodectus corallinus]]'' and ''[[Latrodectus curacaviensis]]''). Species vary widely in size. In most cases, the females are dark-coloured, but some may have lighter bodies or even reddish. Many can have red, white or brown markings on the upper-side (dorsal) of the abdomen. Some can be readily identifiable by reddish markings on the central underside (ventral) abdomen, which are often [[hourglass]]-shaped.\n\nThese small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the neurotoxin [[latrotoxin]], which causes the condition [[latrodectism]], both named after the genus. Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands and their [[spider bite|bite]] can be particularly harmful to large vertebrates, including humans. Only the bites of the females are dangerous to humans. Despite their notoriety, ''Latrodectus'' bites rarely  cause death or produce serious complications.\n\n==Description==\nFemale widow spiders are typically dark brown or a shiny black in colour when they are full grown, usually exhibiting a red or orange hourglass on the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] surface (underside) of the abdomen; some may have a pair of red spots or have no marking at all. The male widow spiders often exhibit various red or red and white markings on the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface (upper side) of the abdomen, ranging from a single stripe to bars or spots, and juveniles are often similar to the male pattern. Females of a few species are paler brown and some have no bright markings. The bodies of black widow spiders range from {{cvt|3-10|mm|in}} in size; some females can measure {{cvt|13|mm|in}} in their body length.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Widow Spiders|url=http://www.orkin.com/other/spiders/black-widows/|website=Orkin Pest Control|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:black-widow-red-spots-yellow-legs.jpg|thumb|right|Juvenile southern black widow (''[[Latrodectus mactans]]'')]]\nThe prevalence of [[sexual cannibalism]], a behaviour in which the female eats the male after mating, has inspired the [[common name]] \"widow spiders\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Breene |first1=R.

Black widow spiders prefer to nest near the ground in dark and undisturbed areas, usually in small holes produced by animals, or around construction openings or wood piles. Indoor nests are in dark, undisturbed places such as under desks or furniture or in a basement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Widow Spider - Facts, Bite & Habitat Information|url=https://animalcorner.co.uk/animals/black-widow-spider/|website=Animal Corner|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> The spider frequently hangs upside down near the centre of its web and waits for insects to blunder in and get stuck. Then, before the insect can extricate itself, the spider rushes over to envenomate and wrap it in silk. To feed, the spider's mouth pulses [[digestive juice]]s over the prey, which liquifies\u2014and then the spider internalizes by [[capillary action]], sucking the slurry into its mouth.<ref name=\"Eberhard\">{{cite journal |last1=Eberhard |first1=W G |title=The mystery of how spiders extract food without masticating prey |journal=Bulletin of the British Arachnological Society |date=2006 |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=372\u20136|url=http://britishspiders.org.uk/bulletin/130908.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"natgeo\">{{cite web|title=Black Widow Spiders|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/black-widow-spiders/?beta=true|website=National Geographic|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=10 September 2010}}</ref> Their prey consists of small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, beetles, and caterpillars.<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> If the spider perceives a threat, it quickly lets itself down to the ground on a safety line of silk.\n\nAs with other web-weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend on vibrations reaching them through their webs to find trapped prey or warn them of larger threats. When a widow spider is trapped, it is unlikely to bite, preferring to play dead or flick silk at the potential threat; bites occur when they cannot escape.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nelsen|first1=David|last2=Kelln|first2=Wayne|last3=Hayes|first3=William|title=Poke but don't pinch: risk assessment and venom metering in the western black-widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.12.019|volume=89|journal=Animal Behaviour|pages=107\u2013114|year=2014}}</ref> Many injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets unintentionally squeezed or pinched.

A member of the [[Theridiidae]] family, this genus contains 32 [[species]],<ref name=WSC_sl3502/> which include several North American \"Black Widows\" (Southern Black Widow ''[[Latrodectus mactans]]'', Western Black Widow ''[[Latrodectus hesperus]]'', and Northern Black Widow ''[[Latrodectus variolus]]''). In addition to these in North America are also the Red Widow ''[[Latrodectus bishopi]]'' and the Brown Widow ''[[Latrodectus geometricus]]'', which, in addition to North America, has a much wider geographic distribution. Elsewhere, others include the [[European black widow]] (''Latrodectus tredecimguttatus''), the Australian [[Redback spider|Redback Black Widow]] (''Latrodectus hasseltii''), several different species in Southern Africa that can be called [[Button spider]]s, and the South American black widow spiders (''[[Latrodectus corallinus]]'' and ''[[Latrodectus curacaviensis]]''). Species vary widely in size. In most cases, the females are dark-coloured, but some may have lighter bodies or even reddish. Many can have red, white or brown markings on the upper-side (dorsal) of the abdomen. Some can be readily identifiable by reddish markings on the central underside (ventral) abdomen, which are often [[hourglass]]-shaped.\n\nThese small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the neurotoxin [[latrotoxin]], which causes the condition [[latrodectism]], both named after the genus. Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands and their [[spider bite|bite]] can be particularly harmful to large vertebrates, including humans. Only the bites of the females are dangerous to humans. Despite their notoriety, ''Latrodectus'' bites rarely  cause death or produce serious complications.\n\n==Description==\nFemale widow spiders are typically dark brown or a shiny black in colour when they are full grown, usually exhibiting a red or orange hourglass on the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] surface (underside) of the abdomen; some may have a pair of red spots or have no marking at all. The male widow spiders often exhibit various red or red and white markings on the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface (upper side) of the abdomen, ranging from a single stripe to bars or spots, and juveniles are often similar to the male pattern. Females of a few species are paler brown and some have no bright markings. The bodies of black widow spiders range from {{cvt|3-10|mm|in}} in size; some females can measure {{cvt|13|mm|in}} in their body length.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Widow Spiders|url=http://www.orkin.com/other/spiders/black-widows/|website=Orkin Pest Control|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:black-widow-red-spots-yellow-legs.jpg|thumb|right|Juvenile southern black widow (''[[Latrodectus mactans]]'')]]\nThe prevalence of [[sexual cannibalism]], a behaviour in which the female eats the male after mating, has inspired the [[common name]] \"widow spiders\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Breene |first1=R.

His father, Rev. Canon Dennis Hart, was the [[vicar]] of St Saviour's in [[St Albans]]. Hart began his life as a musician performing with the Rattfinks, [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]]'s second band, the first being [[The Zombies]]. In 1966, he began performing with the [[Blackpool]]-born [[Maddy Prior]], touring English folk clubs. In 1968 and 1969 the [[duet (music)|duo]] recorded two albums: ''Folk Songs of Olde England'', Volumes One and Two.\n\n==Steeleye Span==\nFrom 1970 to 1982, Hart and [[Maddy Prior|Prior]] were the backbone of [[Steeleye Span]]. Hart's contribution to the band demonstrated his musical abilities on a wide range of instruments, some electric, including: acoustic guitars, dulcimer, organ, 5 string banjo, mandolin, bells, tabor and spoons as well as vocals.<ref>Album covers for first six vinyl recordings with Steeleye Span.</ref>\n\nIn 1971, as well as recording two albums as part of [[Steeleye Span]], they recorded ''[[Summer Solstice (album)|Summer Solstice]]'' \u2013 a much more professional recording than their first two albums, including a string arrangement by [[Robert Kirby (musician)|Robert Kirby]], better known for his work with [[Nick Drake]]. Almost every song that Hart sang was traditional. [[Steeleye Span]]'s commercial success peaked in 1975. They toured in the United States and Australia and used electric instruments more frequently. However, further hits eluded them. They announced that their 1978 tour of the United Kingdom would be their farewell, although they reformed and continue recording and performing live to this day.\n\n==The fragmentation==\nHart took this opportunity to release a solo album, ''Tim Hart'', in 1979. Steeleye Span members Maddy Prior, Rick Kemp, and Nigel Pegrum contributed vocals, bass, drums, and percussion.<ref>''Tim Hart'', Chrysalis Records Limited, London, UK 1979.</ref> [[Bob Johnson (musician)|Bob Johnson]] and [[Peter Knight (folk musician)|Peter Knight]] recorded a narrative project in 1977, ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter (album)|The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''. [[Maddy Prior]] produced two solo albums in 1978, ''Woman in the Wings'' and ''Changing Winds'', that included her own compositions. Hart appeared on one more Steeleye Span record, ''[[Sails of Silver]]'', before resigning in 1982. His last gig was at the [[Theatre Royal, Norwich]].\n\nIn 1981 Hart released two albums of [[nursery rhyme]]s originally written for his own children on the [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]] label. He used most of Steeleye Span, and other musicians who had small children and could take the project seriously. In a bold move, he became a record producer for a [[musical ensemble#Rock and pop bands|rock band]], [[The Monochrome Set]]. Their album ''Eligible Bachelors'' was a whimsical cynical view of relations between the sexes.\n\nHart's health seriously declined, and in 1988 he emigrated to [[La Gomera]], a small island in the [[Canary Islands]]. Abandoning music altogether, he became a full-time writer and photographer, married again, built himself a house on the side of a mountain, and restored his health. As there was no guidebook to La Gomera available in English, Hart wrote, and took most of the photographs for, ''La Gomera: A Guide to the Unspoiled Canary Island''  (2004).\n\n==The Journey==\nIn 1995, Hart was persuaded to return to the United Kingdom for a five-hour marathon performance. It was a concert in aid of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], and featured almost every member of Steeleye Span. A recording of the concert, ''The Journey'' did not appear until 1999. Hart also appeared occasionally as a support act on Steeleye Span tours, opening the show with a solo set and typically joining the band on stage for the encore.\n\nFor many years he did not perform outside of La Gomera. However, Hart performed with Maddy Prior as part of the [[BBC Electric Proms]] on 23 October 2008.<ref>[http://www.parkrecords.com/tourdates.php Maddy Prior Plays BBC Electric Proms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907194735/http://parkrecords.com/tourdates.php |date=7 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nIn December 2008, Hart was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, and returned to England with his wife Conny to seek continuing medical treatment.<ref>[http://www.blog.still-dancing.com/2009/05/tim-hart Photo by [[Oliver Weber]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609113620/http://www.blog.still-dancing.com/2009/05/tim-hart/ |date=9 June 2009 }}</ref> It was announced during Steeleye Span's 2009 winter tour that [[Park Records]] would be reissuing Hart's recordings of nursery rhymes to support him through his illness.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station. It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit.

In November 2009 SpaceX conducted the initial second stage test firing lasting forty seconds. This test succeeded without aborts or recycles.

The test aborted at T\u22122&nbsp;seconds due to a failure in the system designed to pump high-pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps, which would get them spinning in preparation for launch. Subsequent review showed that the failure occurred when a valve did not receive a command to open. As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't occur at the [[SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility|McGregor test site]], which did not have the same valve setup. Some fire and smoke were seen at the base of the rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire. However, the fire and smoke were the result of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch, and no damage was sustained by the vehicle or the test pad. All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected, and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing.

To compensate for the resulting loss of acceleration, the first stage had to burn 28 seconds longer than planned, and the second stage had to burn an extra 15 seconds. That extra burn time of the second stage reduced its fuel reserves, so that the likelihood that there was sufficient fuel to reach the planned orbit above the space station with the secondary payload dropped from 99% to 95%. Because NASA had purchased the launch and therefore contractually controlled a number of mission decision points, NASA declined SpaceX's request to restart the second stage and attempt to deliver the secondary payload into the correct orbit. This risk was understood by the secondary payload customer at time of the signing of the launch contract. As a result, the secondary payload satellite reentered the atmosphere a few days after launch.<ref name=sn20121011 />\n\nOn a March 18, 2020 Starlink mission, one of the first stage engines failed 3 seconds before MECO. The payload was inserted into the correct orbit, but the booster recovery failed.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station. It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit.

According to Elon Musk, the complexity of the development work and the regulatory requirements for launching from Cape Canaveral contributed to the delay.<ref name=\"flightglobal 2008-02-27\" />\n\nThe first multi-engine test (with two engines connected to the first stage, firing simultaneously) was successfully completed in January 2008,<ref name=\"SpaceX 18 January 2008\" /> with successive tests leading to the full Falcon&nbsp;9 complement of nine engines test fired for a full mission length (178&nbsp;seconds) of the first stage in November 2008.<ref name=\"SpaceX November 23, 2008\" /> In October 2009, the first flight-ready first stage had a successful all-engine test fire at the company's test stand in McGregor, Texas. In November 2009 SpaceX conducted the initial second stage test firing lasting forty seconds. This test succeeded without aborts or recycles. In January 2010, a full-duration (329 seconds) orbit-insertion firing of the Falcon&nbsp;9 second stage was conducted at the McGregor test site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Merlin Vacuum Engine Test|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkdReoxGHG8|website=Youtube|access-date=February 23, 2015|date=November 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212202538/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkdReoxGHG8|archive-date=February 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The full stack arrived at the launch site for integration at the beginning of February 2010, and SpaceX initially scheduled a launch date of March 2010, though they estimated anywhere between one and three months for integration and testing.<ref name=\"March8\" />\n\nIn February 2010, SpaceX's first flight stack was set vertical at Space Launch Complex&nbsp;40, Cape Canaveral,<ref name=\"SpaceX February 25, 2010\" /> and on March 9, SpaceX performed a static fire test, where the first stage was to be fired without taking off. The test aborted at T\u22122&nbsp;seconds due to a failure in the system designed to pump high-pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps, which would get them spinning in preparation for launch. Subsequent review showed that the failure occurred when a valve did not receive a command to open. As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't occur at the [[SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility|McGregor test site]], which did not have the same valve setup. Some fire and smoke were seen at the base of the rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire. However, the fire and smoke were the result of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch, and no damage was sustained by the vehicle or the test pad. All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected, and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing. A subsequent test on March 13 was successful in firing the nine first-stage engines for 3.5&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=\"universetoday March 13, 2010\" />\n\n=== Production ===\nIn December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months, with a plan to double the rate to one every six weeks.<ref name=\"spacedotcom20101209\" /> By September 2013, SpaceX total manufacturing space had increased to nearly {{convert|1000000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} and the factory had been configured to achieve a maximum production rate of 40 rocket cores per year.<ref name=sxProd20130924>{{cite web |title=Production at SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/09/24/production-spacex |date=September 24, 2013 |publisher=SpaceX |access-date=September 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403055117/http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/09/24/production-spacex |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>  The factory was producing one Falcon 9 vehicle per month as of November 2013.

To compensate for the resulting loss of acceleration, the first stage had to burn 28 seconds longer than planned, and the second stage had to burn an extra 15 seconds. That extra burn time of the second stage reduced its fuel reserves, so that the likelihood that there was sufficient fuel to reach the planned orbit above the space station with the secondary payload dropped from 99% to 95%. Because NASA had purchased the launch and therefore contractually controlled a number of mission decision points, NASA declined SpaceX's request to restart the second stage and attempt to deliver the secondary payload into the correct orbit. This risk was understood by the secondary payload customer at time of the signing of the launch contract. As a result, the secondary payload satellite reentered the atmosphere a few days after launch.<ref name=sn20121011 />\n\nOn a March 18, 2020 Starlink mission, one of the first stage engines failed 3 seconds before MECO. The payload was inserted into the correct orbit, but the booster recovery failed. SpaceX stated in the webcast of the next Starlink mission that the engine had failed due to the ignition of some isopropyl alcohol that was not properly purged after cleaning the engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/spacex-engine-issue-on-last-starlink-mission-caused-by-cleaning-fluid-according-to-elon-musk/|title=SpaceX engine issue on last Starlink mission caused by cleaning fluid according to Elon Musk|date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Reusability ===\n{{main|SpaceX reusable launch system development program}}\n[[File:SES-10 Launch - world's first reflight of an orbital class rocket (32915200224).jpg|thumb|upright|The first reflight of an orbital class rocket, by SpaceX in March 2017]]\n\nSpaceX intended to recover the first stages of several early Falcon flights to assist engineers in designing for future reusability.

The band consisted of [[Dale Grundle]] (vocals/guitar), [[Alice Lemon]] (vocals/keyboards), [[Peter Kelly (musician)|Peter Kelly]] (drums), [[Ger FitzGerald (musician)|Ger FitzGerald]] (bass, until 1995), [[Craig Carpenter]] (bass, 1996 onwards) and [[Jonathan Lord (musician)|Jonathan Lord]] (lead guitar, 1998). Grundle and Lemon had known each other since their teens in [[Portstewart]], [[Northern Ireland]]. In 2006, Grundle formed [[The sleeping years|The Sleeping Years]].\n\n==Biography==\nEarly demos were sent to various London based labels in 1994 and caught the attention of [[Setanta Records]] supremo, Keith Cullen. Their first release, a 7\" called ''Cotton dress'', was recorded with [[The Divine Comedy (band)|Divine Comedy]] producer [[Darren Allison]] at [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]]'s London studio and became [[Melody Maker]]'s Single Of The Week. \"Catchers are sublime, enchanting and some strange kind of wonderful\" (Melody Maker).\nA great deal of press attention followed, especially in France where, on the strengths of the \"Cotton Dress\" single alone, the band was offered a prestigious [[Black Session]] on [[C'est Lenoir]], a legendary Radio France programme.\n\n''Mute'', the band's first album, was produced by [[Mike Hedges]] at his studio in [[Normandy]], France. ''Mute'' was released at the end of September 1994 to critical acclaim on both sides of the English Channel, especially in France. \"Truly wonderful\" (Melody Maker).  \"Deliriously great songs\" (NME). \u2018\u2019A record of pastoral delights\u2019\u2019 (The Times).\nFrom then on, France would become a second home for the band. In 1994, ''Mute'' made both the journalists and the readers top ten albums of the year poll in the influential [[Les Inrockuptibles]] magazine.\nThe rest of the year and the first part of 1995 were spent on the road in the UK and mainland Europe opening for the likes of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], and [[Edwyn Collins]], as well as headlining their own shows and playing both [[La Route du Rock]] and [[Les Inrocks]] festivals in France.\n\nIn 1995, Catchers signed to Warner Music Discovery in the US, a label run by the legendary [[Jac Holzman]], founder of Elektra Records. Holzman had previously signed [[The Doors]] and [[Love (band)|Love]] to his fledgling label in the sixties. The band temporarily relocated to New York City and started a three-month tour that would take them from coast to coast, opening for [[The Innocence Mission]] as well as headlining their own dates.\n\nIn the Autumn of 1995, the band returned to London and [[Dale Grundle]] started working on new demos in his home studio. Catchers resurfaced in 1998 with a new single, ''Call Her Name''. By this time, the band had become a five piece with the addition of an extra guitarist, [[Jonathan Lord (musician)|Jonathan Lord]] and a new bass player, [[Craig Carpenter]].\n\nLater that year, the band released ''Stooping to Fit'', their second album. Recorded at the [[Cocteau Twins]] studios in London, ''Stooping to Fit'' displayed some intense and beautiful strings and brass arrangements by [[Nick Drake]]'s collaborator, [[Robert Kirby (musician)|Robert Kirby]] and revealed a darker edge to Grundle's pop sensibility. Comparisons with [[The Cure]] were made in recognition of Dale's ability to write an album with great, straightforward pop songs as well as more moody and searing numbers.\n\n''Stooping To Fit'' was very well received in France and the band was invited to play [[La Route du Rock]] festival in Brittany a second time as well as [[Les Rockomotives]] festival in Vend\u00f4me. In September 1998, Catchers embarked on a 15 date tour around France for what would ultimately be their last headlining tour.\n\nIn spite of glowing reviews (\"Wonderfully crafted songsmithery\u2019\u2019 (Time Out) \u2018\u2019A soft-spoken masterpiece\u2019\u2019 (The Times). \"The most emotive pop music around\" (Totally Wired), ''Stooping To Fit'' was poorly promoted by their UK label, [[Setanta Records]], and sales were disappointing.\n\nOn 19 February 1999 Catchers played at The Garage in Highbury, London.

It is one of the country's main tourist centres located on the [[Red Sea]] [[Red Sea Riviera|coast]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Hurghada - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|]]\nThe city was founded in the early 20th century, and until recently it was a small fishing village. But since the 1980s, it has been continually enlarged by Egyptian and foreign investors to become the leading coastal resort on the Red Sea. Holiday resorts and hotels provide aquatic sport facilities for [[windsurf]]ers, [[kitesurf]]ers, [[yachts]]men, [[scuba diver]]s and [[Snorkeling|snorkel]]ers. Hurghada is known for its [[watersports]] activities, nightlife and warm weather. Daily temperature hovers round {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} most of the year, during July and August temperatures reach over {{convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Many Europeans head to Hurghada for their regular Holidays, especially during the Winter season and spend their Christmas and New Year holidays in the city. Tourism from Russia dropped drastically after the [[Metrojet Flight 9268]] plane crash in November 2015.\n\nHurghada stretches for about {{convert|36|km|mi|0}} along the seashore, and it does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from [[Cairo]], the Delta and [[Upper Egypt]], as well as [[package holiday]] tourists from Europe.  Today Hurghada counts 248,000 inhabitants and is divided into: \n*El Ahia and El Helal, the northern part;\n*El Dahar (Downtown) is the old part; \n*Sekalla is the city center;\n*El Kawsar is the modern part;\n*El Memsha (Village road) is pedestrian road stretching over 4&nbsp;km.\n\nAlong the El Mamsha you find many of Hurghada's new hotels, restaurants, and shops. Most of the newest and biggest hotel resorts located in the area between Mamsha to Sahl Hasheesh (Village road). After Sahl Hasheesh you find Makadi Bay with its hotels. Dahar is the oldest part of the town, where the town's traditional [[bazaar]], the [[post office]] and the long-distance bus stations, Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus are situated. The busiest area is its \"city center\" Sakala, which is spread along Sheraton Road. There are some hotels, shops and restaurants along Sheraton Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lifebeyondex.com|title=Everything about Hurghada. And Much More.|website=Lifebeyondex}}</ref>\n\nThe city is served by the [[Hurghada International Airport]] with scheduled passenger traffic connecting to [[Cairo]] and directly with several cities in [[Europe]]. A new terminal was opened in 2015 to accommodate rising traffic.\n\n== History ==\nThe village, which later evolved into what is now the city of Hurghada, was settled in 1905. It acquired its name from a plant which has grown naturally since [[Ancient Egypt|ancient times]]. By then it was only a fishing village. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913, but actual production and export only began in 1921 under British oil magnates. During the reign of [[King Farouk]] a recreational center was built in the city, but after President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s nationalization of Egypt's industries it was turned over to the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|armed forces]].\n\nDuring the [[War of Attrition]] between Israel and Egypt, Shadwan island east of the city in the Red Sea, was fortified and held by Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22 January 1970, it was the site of [[Operation Rhodes]], a heliborne assault by Israeli troops which occupied the island for 36 hours.\n\nDuring the [[Yom Kippur War|October War of 1973]], Hurghada harbor was target for {{illm|Magavit operations|lt=four Israeli operations|he|\u05de\u05d1\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9 \u05de\u05d2\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea}}.

Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year and have become popular for various water-sports, particularly recreational scuba diving and snorkelling.\n\nDive sites around Abu Ramada Island, [[Fanadir]], Giftun Kebir, and Giftun Soraya are popular. Tourists also visit shipwrecks such as the El Mina or the Rosalie Moller.

in central Hurghada.]] \n[[El Qoseir]] is one of the Egyptian gateways, and one of the oldest cities on the western coast of the Red Sea. In the past it was known by various names, such as ''Thagho'' in the pharonic period, ''Leucos Limen'' (white port in [[Greek language|Greek]]) in the Hellenistic and Ptolemaic period, and ''Portus Albus'' in the Roman period. In the Islamic period it was given the name ''El Qoseir'', which means \"a small palace or fortress\".\n\nLocated between Hurghada and Marsa Alam, El Quseir used to be an important port. Many people traveled from there to the land of Punt to buy [[ivory]], [[leather]] and [[incense]]. During the Ottoman  and the Islamic periods, Egyptians and Muslims from North Africa traveled from El Quseir as pilgrims to Mecca. It was also the only port importing coffee from [[Yemen]]. During the French occupation of Egypt, El Qoseir was the arrival point for Arabs and Muslims from Hegaz coming to fight beside the Mamalic against the French army. The most important sites in El Qoseir are the fort and the water reservoir. The water reservoir was El Qoseir's only source of drinking water 100 years ago.\n\nEl Qoseir El Adima is another important site as well. It was the old Roman port where hundreds of [[amphora]] and old [[pottery]] artifacts were found. Even the police station is located at a historical site. There are now many bazaars here, as well as cafes, coffee shops and restaurants offering sea food.  There are several 300-year-old buildings here: the Ottoman fort and the old mosques El Farran, El Qenawi and El Senousi.\n\n===Makadi Bay===\nA Tourist Resort located 30&nbsp;km south of Hurghada dedicated only to hotels, shops and clubs.

It is one of the country's main tourist centres located on the [[Red Sea]] [[Red Sea Riviera|coast]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Hurghada - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|]]\nThe city was founded in the early 20th century, and until recently it was a small fishing village. But since the 1980s, it has been continually enlarged by Egyptian and foreign investors to become the leading coastal resort on the Red Sea. Holiday resorts and hotels provide aquatic sport facilities for [[windsurf]]ers, [[kitesurf]]ers, [[yachts]]men, [[scuba diver]]s and [[Snorkeling|snorkel]]ers. Hurghada is known for its [[watersports]] activities, nightlife and warm weather. Daily temperature hovers round {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} most of the year, during July and August temperatures reach over {{convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Many Europeans head to Hurghada for their regular Holidays, especially during the Winter season and spend their Christmas and New Year holidays in the city. Tourism from Russia dropped drastically after the [[Metrojet Flight 9268]] plane crash in November 2015.\n\nHurghada stretches for about {{convert|36|km|mi|0}} along the seashore, and it does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from [[Cairo]], the Delta and [[Upper Egypt]], as well as [[package holiday]] tourists from Europe.  Today Hurghada counts 248,000 inhabitants and is divided into: \n*El Ahia and El Helal, the northern part;\n*El Dahar (Downtown) is the old part; \n*Sekalla is the city center;\n*El Kawsar is the modern part;\n*El Memsha (Village road) is pedestrian road stretching over 4&nbsp;km.\n\nAlong the El Mamsha you find many of Hurghada's new hotels, restaurants, and shops. Most of the newest and biggest hotel resorts located in the area between Mamsha to Sahl Hasheesh (Village road). After Sahl Hasheesh you find Makadi Bay with its hotels. Dahar is the oldest part of the town, where the town's traditional [[bazaar]], the [[post office]] and the long-distance bus stations, Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus are situated. The busiest area is its \"city center\" Sakala, which is spread along Sheraton Road. There are some hotels, shops and restaurants along Sheraton Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lifebeyondex.com|title=Everything about Hurghada. And Much More.|website=Lifebeyondex}}</ref>\n\nThe city is served by the [[Hurghada International Airport]] with scheduled passenger traffic connecting to [[Cairo]] and directly with several cities in [[Europe]]. A new terminal was opened in 2015 to accommodate rising traffic.\n\n== History ==\nThe village, which later evolved into what is now the city of Hurghada, was settled in 1905. It acquired its name from a plant which has grown naturally since [[Ancient Egypt|ancient times]]. By then it was only a fishing village. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913, but actual production and export only began in 1921 under British oil magnates. During the reign of [[King Farouk]] a recreational center was built in the city, but after President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s nationalization of Egypt's industries it was turned over to the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|armed forces]].\n\nDuring the [[War of Attrition]] between Israel and Egypt, Shadwan island east of the city in the Red Sea, was fortified and held by Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22 January 1970, it was the site of [[Operation Rhodes]], a heliborne assault by Israeli troops which occupied the island for 36 hours.\n\nDuring the [[Yom Kippur War|October War of 1973]], Hurghada harbor was target for {{illm|Magavit operations|lt=four Israeli operations|he|\u05de\u05d1\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9 \u05de\u05d2\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea}}.

in central Hurghada.]] \n[[El Qoseir]] is one of the Egyptian gateways, and one of the oldest cities on the western coast of the Red Sea. In the past it was known by various names, such as ''Thagho'' in the pharonic period, ''Leucos Limen'' (white port in [[Greek language|Greek]]) in the Hellenistic and Ptolemaic period, and ''Portus Albus'' in the Roman period. In the Islamic period it was given the name ''El Qoseir'', which means \"a small palace or fortress\".\n\nLocated between Hurghada and Marsa Alam, El Quseir used to be an important port. Many people traveled from there to the land of Punt to buy [[ivory]], [[leather]] and [[incense]]. During the Ottoman  and the Islamic periods, Egyptians and Muslims from North Africa traveled from El Quseir as pilgrims to Mecca. It was also the only port importing coffee from [[Yemen]]. During the French occupation of Egypt, El Qoseir was the arrival point for Arabs and Muslims from Hegaz coming to fight beside the Mamalic against the French army. The most important sites in El Qoseir are the fort and the water reservoir. The water reservoir was El Qoseir's only source of drinking water 100 years ago.\n\nEl Qoseir El Adima is another important site as well. It was the old Roman port where hundreds of [[amphora]] and old [[pottery]] artifacts were found. Even the police station is located at a historical site. There are now many bazaars here, as well as cafes, coffee shops and restaurants offering sea food.  There are several 300-year-old buildings here: the Ottoman fort and the old mosques El Farran, El Qenawi and El Senousi.\n\n===Makadi Bay===\nA Tourist Resort located 30&nbsp;km south of Hurghada dedicated only to hotels, shops and clubs.
