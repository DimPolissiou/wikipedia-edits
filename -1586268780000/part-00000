It is based on an understanding of \"[[criminality]]\" as a product of the use of [[Power (social and political)|power]] to limit the behaviour of those individuals excluded from power, but who try to overcome social inequality and behave in ways which the power structure prohibits. It focuses on the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the human subject, [[multiculturalism]], [[feminism]], and human relationships to deal with the concepts of \"difference\" and \"otherness\" without [[essentialism]] or [[reductionism]], but its contributions are not always appreciated (Carrington: 1998). Postmodernists shift attention from [[Marx]]ist concerns of economic and social oppression to linguistic production, arguing that [[criminal law]] is a [[language]] to create dominance relationships. For example, the language of courts (the so-called \"legalese\") expresses and institutionalises the domination of the individual, whether accused or accuser, criminal or victim, by social institutions. According to postmodernist criminology, the [[discourse]] of criminal law is dominant, exclusive and rejecting, less diverse, and [[Culture|culturally]] not [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]], exaggerating narrowly defined rules for the exclusion of others.\n\n== Definitional issues ==\n\nA crime might be defined on the basis that the behaviour represents a danger to [[society]] and it is designated as such in the penal code (''nullum crimen sine lege'' the [[Latin]] presumption that there can be no crime without a law defining it as such). Human activity extends its range as society develops, and any of these activities (with or without reason) may be considered harmful for people and are therefore \u201cextinguished\u201d by society either through informal [[Morality|moral]] condemnation or by the [[State (polity)|state]] when formal legal restrictions are infringed. There are overlapping explanations of criminality:\n* There is nothing inherently \"criminal\" in any given act; crime and criminality are relative terms, social constructs reflecting [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] social policies, e.g. one killing may be [[murder]], another [[justifiable homicide]].\n* Hess and Scheerer (1997) suggest that criminality is not so much an [[Ontology|ontological]] phenomenon as a mental construct having an historical and protean character. \n* Society \u201cconstructs\u201d its elements on the basis of ontological realities. Thus, in reality certain types of human activity are harmful and damaging, and are understood and judged so by others, by society as a whole. But it is also true that other forms of criminal behaviour do not harm others and are therefore [[Criminalisation|criminalised]] without sufficient ontological grounds (see [[Public order crime]]).\n* Criminality is almost completely constructed by the controlling institutions which establish norms and attribute determinate meanings to certain acts; criminality is thus a social and linguistic construct. \nThis difficulty in defining the basic concept of criminality applies equally to questions concerning its causes; even in physical and biological systems it is difficult, although not impossible, to isolate the cause-effect link from its context of interrelationships. It is more difficult for social systems. Indeed, some{{who?|date=January 2015}} argue that [[chaos theory]] may provide a more appropriate model for what is termed the \"[[social science]]s\". Thus, for postmodernism, the key \u201ccriminogenic\u201d factor is the change in society from hierarchical relationships to ones based on differentiation with the meta-codes for identity as the determinant for social inclusion/exclusion (Gilinskiy: 2001).\n\n== Theoretical concerns ==\n{{Postmodernism}}\n\nPostmodernism is associated with the decline of [[Left-wing politics|the left]]'s credibility, specifically in the failure of [[state socialism]] to offer an attractive and, later, even a viable alternative to Western [[capitalism]]. Both Marxism and [[socialism]] derived their philosophical foundation from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Postmodernism is a critique of the Enlightenment and of scientific [[positivism]] which has argued that the world can be understood and both \"[[truth]]\" and \"[[justice]]\" can be discovered by applying the universal linear principle of reason (see Milovanovic, who describes the shift from [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] thought). The idea that the application of scientific principles to social life will uncover the laws of society, making human life predictable and social engineering practical and possible, is discounted. Postmodernists argue that this claim for the universality of reason was ethnocentric in that it privileged one Western view of the world while discounting other views (Kiely, 1995: 153-154). and truth claims were part of a relationship of domination, a claim to power. Given the history of [[colonialism]] and [[globalisation]] in both the physical and the intellectual world, this critique asserts righteous indignation and moral superiority. In postmodernism, \"truth\" and \"falsity\" are purely relative; each culture has its own standard for judging truth that is not inherently superior to any other. Postmodernist analysis is a method to uncover how the world is made to appear real, \"thereby questioning that it is real in truth or fact, or that there is any way of making such judgements\". No truth claim, and certainly not Enlightenment scientism, rests on any more secure foundation than any other. No knowledge claim is privileged.\n\nThe main weakness of [[relativism]] is that it offers no basis for evaluation. Henry and Milovanovic (1996) posit that all claims are to be considered valid, all social practices merely cultural variations, neither inherently inferior nor superior to any other. This may be potentially progressive because it challenges the absolutist assumptions of the superiority of, for example, Western [[economics]] and [[capitalism]]. But it does not challenge the ''status quo''. On the contrary, as Kiely (1995: 155) argues, appeals for tolerance and pluralism \"at its worse . . . simply ignores, or even becomes an apology for, all kinds of oppressive practices\" that violate any sense of [[Human rights|human]] and [[social rights]].\n\n===The human subject===\nThe human subject is said to be one or a number of [[Ideology|ideological]] constructions which are transient, multifaceted works-in-process. The discourse has the power to create a convincing truth claim about the reality of any subject that is historically conditioned, particularly when depicting human action. Subjects are continually recreating themselves while simultaneously continually recreating the social context that shapes their identity and potential for action as well as the identity and potential of others to act. Human agents are all \"investors\" in constructing their version of reality. Praxis is defined as purposive social activity born of human agents' consciousness of their world, and mediated through the social groups to which they belong\". It assumes dualistic forms, such as negation/affirmation. Hierarchies are often reconstituted through negation; they are subject to deconstruction through affirmation.\n\n===Structure===\nThe human subject is a \"role-maker\", an agent who can occupy situations and may act contingently in relation to others to affirm or negate their representations. Whereas early conceptions of structure posited an underlying \"reality\" which could be understood [[Empiricism|empirically]], postmodernism, considers structural contexts to be constituted by the discourse to produce culturally and historically specific representations which are imbued with object-like reality and attain relative stability. In this process, other representations are silenced or denied and the human agency that constituted the contingent and transitory \"reality\" may be hidden. At any instance, however, certain depictions gain ascendancy and are strengthened by social action which is undertaken in relation to them. Social actors \"invest\" in these depictions; they organise action to defend specific representations, giving them the appearance of stability and producing the dynamics of subordination and oppression. Social change creates competing discourses and, for a time, alternative realities. When change begins, initial states are always uncertain and through iteration over time, produce outcomes. Inevitably, as change is occurring, cracks and slippage exist, providing the basis for strategic intervention. Action is then organised to defend or deny the representation. In the end, structures as well as subjects possess \"relative autonomy\" while being co-dependent.\n\n===Crime and harmfulness===\nCrime and the identification of harm are categories constituted by the discourse but they are, nevertheless, \"real\" in their consequences. There may be harms of reduction, which occur when a social agent experiences a loss of some quality, and harms of repression, which occur when a social agent experiences a restriction preventing the achievement of a desired end. Crime is the outcome of an agent's \"investment\" in constituting a difference which, through the exercise of \"disrespecting\" power over others, denies their full humanity and, thereby, renders them powerless to constitute their own differences. Far from being confined to \"law\", in this expanded view, the exercise of power is the genesis of harms of all types and, hence, of crime. Law merely legitimises existing social relations of power. Crime, then, is a contingent \"universality\": Victims are numerous but are constituted contingently, relative to historically specifiable relations of power. Power itself is produced and maintained through ideology, through discursive practices. While all humans invest in their respective constructions of reality, some become \"excessive investors\", conflating socially constructed differences with differential evaluations of worth, reinforcing a social hierarchy while suppressing others' co-production, rendering them silent.\n\n== References ==\n* Carrington, K.

The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundar.org.sv/referencias/buscacuscatlan.pdf|title=En la B\u00fasqueda de Cuscatlan|last=Amaroli|first=Paul|date=1986|website=FUNDAR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\n\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of the Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in Managuara until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep.

The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas P.

In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\n\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\n\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\n\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - Demographics |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - MIGRATION |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.\n\nPDC leader [[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=T.D. |author2=D.A.

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool.

Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction.\n\nRecent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.{{when|date=July 2016}} In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.\n\nDespite these efforts, much remains to be done.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}\nThe 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n#\nAfter the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Nayib Bukele]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]].\n\n===Political culture===\n{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|[[President of El Salvador]], [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nEl Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Participates in Signing Ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension - 48342132177.jpg|thumb| U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] participates in a signing ceremony for the CSL Lease Extension with Salvadoran President [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nIn November, 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered [[14th Dalai Lama]] by supporting his [[Tibet]]an Government cabinet minister's [[telegram]] requesting an appeal before the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] to stop the Communist [[China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]]'s invasion of Tibet. \"Only the tiny country of El Salvador agreed to sponsor Tibet's plea.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Story of Tibet:Conversations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama|last=Laird|first=Thomas|publisher=Grove Press|year=2006|isbn=9780802118271|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303 303\u2013305]|url=https://archive.org/details/storyoftibetconv00lair/page/303}}</ref>\"At the UN, no one was willing to stand up beside El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |accessdate=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>{{cite news |title=CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=elsalvador.com |date=21 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045947/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref> The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

E. MacDonald.png|thumb|El Salvador has surf tourism due to large waves from the Pacific Ocean.]]\nMost North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador's beaches and nightlife. Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom. Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools. Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems. Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nEducation in El Salvador is free through high school. After nine years of basic education (elementary\u2013middle school), students have the option of a two-year high school or a three-year high school. A two-year high school prepares the student for transfer to a university. A three-year high school allows the student to graduate and enter the workforce in a vocational career, or to transfer to a university to further their education in their chosen field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~hakuta/www/archives/syllabi/E_CLAD/sfusd_cult_03/nancy/new/educ.html|title=What's Education Like in El Salvador|last=|first=|date=|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>\n\n[[List of universities in El Salvador|Universities in El Salvador]] include a central public institution, the [[Universidad de El Salvador]], and many other specialized private universities.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Maribel Arrieta]] (Model)\n*[[Mar\u00eda Eugenia Brizuela de \u00c1vila]] (businesswoman)\n*[[Nayib Bukele]] (politician)\n*[[Carlos Calleja]] (businessman/politician)\n*[[C\u00e1thia]] (singer)\n*[[Mauricio Merino Jr.]] (actor/model)\n*[[Francesca Miranda]] (Fashion Designer)\n*[[Ana Ligia Mixco Sol de Saca]] (businesswoman)\n*[[Marisela De Montecristo]] (Model)\n*[[J.

''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de ma\u00edz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatl\u00e1n Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]\n\n[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador.

The paleontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed not only several remnants of [[Cuvieronius]], but also several other species of vertebrates. In the Tomayate site, they have recovered at least 19 species of vertebrates, including [[giant tortoise]]s, [[Megatherium]], [[Glyptodon]], [[Toxodon]], extinct horses, paleo-llamas and especially a large number of skeletal remains of proboscis genus [[Cuvieronius]]. The Tomayate site stands out from most Central American [[Pleistocene]] deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the [[Great American Interchange]], in which the [[Central American]] isthmus landbridge played the title primordial role.

Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundar.org.sv/referencias/buscacuscatlan.pdf|title=En la B\u00fasqueda de Cuscatlan|last=Amaroli|first=Paul|date=1986|website=FUNDAR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\n\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of the Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in Managuara until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendencia]]'' in 1786.\n\nTowards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas P.

In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\n\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\n\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\n\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - Demographics |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Salvador - MIGRATION |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm |website=Country Studies US |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.\n\nPDC leader [[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=T.D. |author2=D.A.

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatit\u00e1n]]]]\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] and [[La Ni\u00f1a]] effects.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name=\"tdfiyp\"/> El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean.<ref name=\"cdkn.org\"/>\n\n====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====\n[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]\nEl Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction.\n\nRecent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.{{when|date=July 2016}} In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.\n\nDespite these efforts, much remains to be done.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}\nThe 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n#\nAfter the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defence of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Nayib Bukele]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]].\n\n===Political culture===\n{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|[[President of El Salvador]], [[Nayib Bukele]]]]\nEl Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] belongs to the FMLN party.

During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of [[Indigo dye|indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to [[coffee]] as the main export.\n\n[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is an important economic centre of El Salvador and home to the \"Carnival of San Miguel\", one of the biggest festivals of entertainment and food in Central America.<ref name=\"Herrera-Sobek2012\">{{cite book|author=Maria Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&pg=PA459|date=31 July 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=459}}</ref>]]\nThe government has sought to improve the collection of its current [[revenue]]s, with a focus on indirect taxes.

Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion.

In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style = class=\"bonita\" style=\"float:left; margin:0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding:0.5em; font-size:95&nbsp;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Exports to\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imports from\n|-\n!

Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign [[income]] and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archivedate=7 November 2007}}</ref> approximately 16.2% of [[gross domestic product]](GDP).\n\nRemittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |accessdate=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>{{cite news |title=CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=elsalvador.com |date=21 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045947/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref> The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

E. MacDonald.png|thumb|El Salvador has surf tourism due to large waves from the Pacific Ocean.]]\nMost North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador's beaches and nightlife. Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de ma\u00edz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatl\u00e1n Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}\n[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]\n\n[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador.

{"title_page": "Wishaw and Coltness Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nThe '''Wishaw and Coltness Railway''' was an early Scottish mineral railway. It ran for approximately 11 miles from Chapel Colliery, at [[Newmains]] in North Lanarkshire connecting to the [[Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway]] near Whifflet, giving a means of transport for minerals around Newmains to market in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nShortage of capital made construction slow, and the line was opened in stages from 1833, opening fully on 9 March 1844.<ref name = awdry/>\n\nIt was built to the track gauge of {{RailGauge|4ft6in|lk=on}}, commonly used in Scotland for coal railways. It had several branches serving pits and ironworks.\n\nIn 1849 it became part of the [[Caledonian Railway]] and sections of the original network form part of the modern West Coast Main Line railway.\n\n==Formation of the railway==\nIn the early decades of the nineteenth century, the pace of industrialisation in central Scotland accelerated considerably, generating a huge demand for the raw materials of coal and iron ore. Transport of these heavy materials to market was a key issue. Canals offered some solution to this problem, but railways came to be seen as a more accessible option. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway was opened in 1828, giving access to Monklands pits to Glasgow and Edinburgh via the Forth and Clyde Canal, vastly reducing the cost of carriage. Pits further afield saw the benefit to their competitors, and thought of constructing their own lines.\n\nA ''Garturk and Garion Railway'' Bill was presented to Parliament in 1829<ref name = james>Leslie James, ''A Chronology of the Construction of Britain's Railways, 1778\u20131855'', Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1983, {{ISBN|0 7110 1277 6}}</ref><ref name = carter>E F Carter, ''An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles'', Cassell, London, 1959</ref> (though Awdry calls it the ''Garion and Garturk Railway'').<ref name = awdry>Christopher Awdry, ''Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies'', Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, {{ISBN|1 85260 049 7}}</ref><ref name = commons>''Journal of the House of Commons'', Volume 84, 23 March 1829</ref><ref group = note>Garion, etc, was the spelling used at the time.</ref>\n\nDuring the parliamentary process the name was changed to the ''Wishaw and Coltness Railway'', and under that name it was incorporated by an Act of Parliament on 1 June 1829.<ref name = james/> This authorised \"making a railway from Chapel, in the parish of Cambusnethan, ...by Coltness and Gariongill, to join the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway ... in the parish of Old Monkland\". Share capital was \u00a380,000 with borrowing powers of \u00a320,000. Tolls were laid down, and \"the company may provide carriages for the conveyance of passengers, and charge for each person conveyed a rate of 4d per mile\" and \"locomotive engines may be used on the railway\"<ref name = robertson>C J A Robertson, ''The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722\u20131844'', John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-85976-088-1}}</ref><ref name = priestley>Joseph Priestley, ''Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers Canals and Railways of Great Britain, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831</ref><ref name=popplewell>Popplewell</ref>\n\nThe name of the company refers to the area where minerals would originate. Coltness Colliery was in the area of Wishaw, and both places were some distance from the present-day communities. The northern end of the proposed system was a junction to another railway at Whifflet, and perhaps did not seem an attractive component when the company's name was being chosen.\n\nPriestley says that the line was \"designed to pass from the collieries of Chapel and Crawfoot, in the parish of Cambusnethan, in the county of Lanark, through Daiziel, Hamilton, Bothwell, Coltness, Overtown, Wishawtown, Motherwell, Burnhouse and Carnbroe, to join the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at Old Monkland; with a branch to Rosehall; a second to the collieries of Stevenson, Carfin and Cleland; and a third from these last places to Law, in the parish of Carluke, in the same county of Lanark\".<ref name = priestley/> Several of these objectives were never achieved in the independent lifetime of the company.\n\nIn securing Parliamentary authority, the company had to accept a clause in its Act forbidding the use of locomotives, to overcome the opposition of Drysdale of Jerviston, to a line which, he claimed, \"would enable the Landed Proprietors south of Major Drysdale to enhance the value of their estates at the expense of his\". The prohibition was later bought out for \u00a31000, of which the company paid half.<ref name = robertson/><ref name = drysdale>Wishaw and Coltness Minutes, 6 Feb 1837, quoted in ''Robertson''</ref>\n\nShortage of funds led to further Acts in 1834 and 1837 to obtain three-year extensions for completion of the railway; a further \u00a380,000 of capital was raised by 1840 and this was followed by a further Act in 1841 to raise an addition \u00a3160,000 of capital.<ref name = robertson/>\n\n==Opening in stages==\n\n===First section to Chapelknowe===\n[[File:Wishaw and Coltness map.gif|thumb|The route of the first section of the Wishaw and Coltness Railway]]The new company found raising money difficult, and this considerably slowed completion of the line.\n\nThe first section was opened on 23 January 1834,<ref name = paterson>John Thomas revised J S Paterson, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders'', David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, {{ISBN|0 946537 12 7}}</ref> running southwards from a junction with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at Whifflat Junction (as it was then spelt: immediately east of the present A725 road) to \"Holytown\", actually on the Holytown Road, now the A775.

When other parts of the line were built later, there was a continuation south and the site became, much later, Mossend North Junction. However a passenger station called Holytown was opened there in 1844, changing its name to Mossend in 1882.\n\nNow running south-east to east, the line passed a Carfin station (renamed Holytown in 1882) and a Newarthill station (renamed Carfin in 1928). As far as this point, the route is still in operation today as Whifflet - Mossend North Jn - Holytown - Carfin, but here the original line turned south to serve several pits in the Cleland estate at Chapelknowe.<ref name = cobb>Col M H Cobb, ''The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas'', Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, {{ISBN|07110 3003 0}}</ref>\n\n===Coltness Estate===\nIn 1836 [[Thomas Houldsworth]], a Manchester entrepreneur, purchased the Coltness Estate, with its extensive mineral rights. At this time the Railway Company had run out of money to complete the building of their line. \"In order to allow the development of his minerals, Houldsworth agreed that if the company extended their line to Coltness, for which they would require to borrow \u00a320,000 and to get an Act allowing an extension of time for construction, he would personally guarantee the interest on the loan, and pay \u00a3300 towards the Act. He also agree to give the necessary land on the Coltness Estate free (apart from compensation to tenants) and to send all his goods by the railway, if the Company charged him the prevailing rate.\" He also agreed to pay half of the payment to the Drysdale estate to buy out the prohibition on locomotives.<ref name = robertson/>\n\n===Reaching Jerviston===\n[[File:Wishaw and Coltness 1845.gif|thumb|Wishaw and Coltness Railway system in 1845]] As money became available, the next extension (actually the intended \"main line\") was built, about a mile long, and opening in 1838, running due south from the junction at \"Holytown\" (i.e. Mossend North Junction) to \"[[Jerviston]]\", serving several pits. The location was at the north end of the (later) Ravenscraig complex, and the route was to the east of the present Mossend - Motherwell line (opened in 1857).<ref name = cobb/>\n\n===On to \"Coltness\"===\nIn 1841 the next section was opened, from Jerviston to Overton (now spelt Overtown). Continuing south from Jerviston and crossing the Clyde, the line turned south-east at Motherwell Junction, a little distance south-east of the present-day station there; from there the line formed the route of the present West Coast Main Line, serving coal and ironstone pits and clay pits and reaching Coltness Colliery, which was in the area between the bridges at Pather and Overtown.<ref name = cobb/>\n\n===To Chapel at last===\nIn 1842 a further extension was opened, taking the line on from Coltness Colliery to Chapel Colliery\u2014the first-named objective in Priestley's description<ref name = priestley/>\u2014in the area of Morningside. This was immediately east of the Stirling Road (later A73). Passenger stations were opened in 1845 at Overtown and \"Carluke\"; the Carluke station was on the Stirling Road near the site of the old Law Hospital.<ref name = cobb/>\n\n===Morningside===\nThe final stage in the gradual extension of the route was achieved on 9 March 1844;<ref name = paterson/> continuing from Chapel Colliery, the line ran the short distance to pits and a brick and tile works close to Morningside, involving a bridge over the Auchter Water.<ref group = note>James states that this is the date when the line ''reached'' Chapel.</ref>\n\n==Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway==\nIn 1845 the [[Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway]] opened its line, on 2 June.<ref name = awdry/> The new railway sought to connect pits further east to the developing network towards the Monklands and the Clyde, and was therefore dependent on the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. The newcomer was always short of money and never succeeded to connecting the important iron works at Wilsontown, and the Inspecting Officer for passenger operation wrote that \"the line terminates in a large field, about a mile from a small village called Whitburn.\"<ref name = coddington>Captain J Coddington, in ''Report dated 11 June 1845'' in Parliamentary Papers, Railway Department, Session: 22 January \u2013 28 August 1846''</ref>\n\nThe newcomer built a Morningside terminus, facing east, in the north-east angle of Mill Road and Morningside Road, and built a short connection to the Wishaw and Coltness (W&CR) line on the west side of Morningside Road.

It ran for approximately 11 miles from Chapel Colliery, at [[Newmains]] in North Lanarkshire connecting to the [[Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway]] near Whifflet, giving a means of transport for minerals around Newmains to market in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nShortage of capital made construction slow, and the line was opened in stages from 1833, opening fully on 9 March 1844.<ref name = awdry/>\n\nIt was built to the track gauge of {{RailGauge|4ft6in|lk=on}}, commonly used in Scotland for coal railways. It had several branches serving pits and ironworks.\n\nIn 1849 it became part of the [[Caledonian Railway]] and sections of the original network form part of the modern West Coast Main Line railway.\n\n==Formation of the railway==\nIn the early decades of the nineteenth century, the pace of industrialisation in central Scotland accelerated considerably, generating a huge demand for the raw materials of coal and iron ore. Transport of these heavy materials to market was a key issue. Canals offered some solution to this problem, but railways came to be seen as a more accessible option. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway was opened in 1828, giving access to Monklands pits to Glasgow and Edinburgh via the Forth and Clyde Canal, vastly reducing the cost of carriage. Pits further afield saw the benefit to their competitors, and thought of constructing their own lines.\n\nA ''Garturk and Garion Railway'' Bill was presented to Parliament in 1829<ref name = james>Leslie James, ''A Chronology of the Construction of Britain's Railways, 1778\u20131855'', Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1983, {{ISBN|0 7110 1277 6}}</ref><ref name = carter>E F Carter, ''An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles'', Cassell, London, 1959</ref> (though Awdry calls it the ''Garion and Garturk Railway'').<ref name = awdry>Christopher Awdry, ''Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies'', Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, {{ISBN|1 85260 049 7}}</ref><ref name = commons>''Journal of the House of Commons'', Volume 84, 23 March 1829</ref><ref group = note>Garion, etc, was the spelling used at the time.</ref>\n\nDuring the parliamentary process the name was changed to the ''Wishaw and Coltness Railway'', and under that name it was incorporated by an Act of Parliament on 1 June 1829.<ref name = james/> This authorised \"making a railway from Chapel, in the parish of Cambusnethan, ...by Coltness and Gariongill, to join the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway ... in the parish of Old Monkland\". Share capital was \u00a380,000 with borrowing powers of \u00a320,000. Tolls were laid down, and \"the company may provide carriages for the conveyance of passengers, and charge for each person conveyed a rate of 4d per mile\" and \"locomotive engines may be used on the railway\"<ref name = robertson>C J A Robertson, ''The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722\u20131844'', John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-85976-088-1}}</ref><ref name = priestley>Joseph Priestley, ''Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers Canals and Railways of Great Britain, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831</ref><ref name=popplewell>Popplewell</ref>\n\nThe name of the company refers to the area where minerals would originate. Coltness Colliery was in the area of Wishaw, and both places were some distance from the present-day communities. The northern end of the proposed system was a junction to another railway at Whifflet, and perhaps did not seem an attractive component when the company's name was being chosen.\n\nPriestley says that the line was \"designed to pass from the collieries of Chapel and Crawfoot, in the parish of Cambusnethan, in the county of Lanark, through Daiziel, Hamilton, Bothwell, Coltness, Overtown, Wishawtown, Motherwell, Burnhouse and Carnbroe, to join the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at Old Monkland; with a branch to Rosehall; a second to the collieries of Stevenson, Carfin and Cleland; and a third from these last places to Law, in the parish of Carluke, in the same county of Lanark\".<ref name = priestley/> Several of these objectives were never achieved in the independent lifetime of the company.\n\nIn securing Parliamentary authority, the company had to accept a clause in its Act forbidding the use of locomotives, to overcome the opposition of Drysdale of Jerviston, to a line which, he claimed, \"would enable the Landed Proprietors south of Major Drysdale to enhance the value of their estates at the expense of his\". The prohibition was later bought out for \u00a31000, of which the company paid half.<ref name = robertson/><ref name = drysdale>Wishaw and Coltness Minutes, 6 Feb 1837, quoted in ''Robertson''</ref>\n\nShortage of funds led to further Acts in 1834 and 1837 to obtain three-year extensions for completion of the railway; a further \u00a380,000 of capital was raised by 1840 and this was followed by a further Act in 1841 to raise an addition \u00a3160,000 of capital.<ref name = robertson/>\n\n==Opening in stages==\n\n===First section to Chapelknowe===\n[[File:Wishaw and Coltness map.gif|thumb|The route of the first section of the Wishaw and Coltness Railway]]The new company found raising money difficult, and this considerably slowed completion of the line.\n\nThe first section was opened on 23 January 1834,<ref name = paterson>John Thomas revised J S Paterson, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders'', David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, {{ISBN|0 946537 12 7}}</ref> running southwards from a junction with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at Whifflat Junction (as it was then spelt: immediately east of the present A725 road) to \"Holytown\", actually on the Holytown Road, now the A775.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India.

Due to an historical need, a national school with places for 200 was opened at the Monastery in 1846. Teaching is not a normal activity of a Carmelite Monastery. However, due to prevailing circumstances, the nuns became the teachers. The average attendance was 70-100. The charge being 1 penny per week \u201cfor those who could afford it\u201d. The school remained open until 1896. A new monastery was opened in 2005. The church was built in 1851 and opened on the Feast of St Teresa on 1 October 1853.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nChrist Church, the Church of Ireland parish church, was built by Peter La Touche at a cost of \u00a35,000 and designed by Whitmore Davis. It was completed in 1789. It is a Gothic-revival building with a steeple rising 30m over the Western entrance, containing a clock and bell. A stone tablet bearing the La Touche family arms is inserted beneath the dial plate of the clock. The interior contains a monument to the memory of David La Touche, Peter\u2019s father. Fashioned in white marble, it was executed by the Irish sculptor, John Hickey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Delgany Protestant church|url=http://www.delganyheritagevillage.com/chirst-church.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:IMG AncientCrossDelgany0706.jpg|thumb|Shaft of Monumental High Cross - a prayer for ''ODRAN SAIR'']]\nThe Old Burial Ground is an early Christian settlement dating back to the 7th century.
