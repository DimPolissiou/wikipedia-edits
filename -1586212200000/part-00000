Dreyfuss is known for designing some of the most iconic devices found in American homes and offices throughout the twentieth century, including the [[Western Electric Model 500 Telephone|Western Electric Model 500 telephone]], the [[Westclox]] Big Ben alarm clock, and the [[Honeywell]] [[Thermostat|round thermostat]]. Dreyfuss enjoyed long term associations with several name brand companies such as [[John Deere]], [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], and [[American Airlines]].\n\n==Career==\nDreyfuss, a native of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], is one of the celebrity industrial designers of the 1930s and 1940s who pioneered his field. Dreyfuss dramatically improved the look, feel, and usability of dozens of consumer products. When compared to [[Raymond Loewy]] and some other contemporaries, Dreyfuss was much more than a stylist; he applied common sense and a scientific approach to design problems, making products more pleasing to the eye and hand, safer to use, and more efficient to manufacture and repair. His work helped popularize the role of the industrial designer while also contributing significant advances to the fields of [[ergonomics]], [[anthropometrics]] and [[human factors]]. \n\nDreyfuss began as a Broadway theatrical designer. Until 1920, he apprenticed under [[Norman Bel Geddes]], who would later become one of his competitors. In 1929 Dreyfuss opened his own office for theatrical and industrial design. His firm quickly met with commercial success, and continued as Henry Dreyfuss Associates for over four decades after his death.\n\n===Designs===\n\n*[[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] model 150 vacuum cleaner (1936)\n* Classic [[Westclox]] ''Big Ben'' alarm clock (1939\u2013present)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://clockhistory.com/westclox/company/ads/benseries.html| title=Westclox Big Ben and Baby Ben Advertising History| website=ClockHistory.com| first=Bill| last=Stoddard}}</ref>\n*[[New York Central Railroad]]'s streamlined [[Mercury (NYC)|Mercury]] train, both [[locomotive]] and passenger cars (1936)<ref name=\"Drury91\">{{cite book |last=Drury |first=George H. |year=1993 |title=Guide to North American Steam Locomotives |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Company |isbn=0-89024-206-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetonorthamer00drur/page/271 271] |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetonorthamer00drur/page/271 }}</ref>\n*[[NYC Hudson]] locomotive for the [[Twentieth Century Limited]] (1938)<ref name=\"Drury91\" />\n* Popular ''Democracity'' model city of the future at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] at the [[Trylon and Perisphere]][[File:Bankers Trust Building 280 Park Avenue.jpg|thumb|225px|280 [[Park Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]]]]\n* Styled [[John Deere]] Model A and Model B tractors (1938)\n* Wahl-Eversharp Skyline fountain pen (1940)\n*[[Royal Typewriter Company]]'s Quiet DeLuxe (late 1940s)\n*[[Bell System]] telephones: [[Model 500 telephone|Western Electric 500]]-series desk and wall telephones (1949 - 1972), [[Princess telephone]] (1959), [[Model 500 telephone#Model_1500|Model 1500 10 digit touchtone]] (1963), [[Model 500 telephone#Model_2500|Model 2500 12-digit touchtone]] (1968\u2013present), and the [[Trimline telephone]] (1965\u2013present)\n* Two American steamships, [[SS Independence|S.S.

human-like \"hosts\" populate several themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez & El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreat their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he is killed during the uprising, a version of his programming is encoded into Maeve's daughter and he is uploaded into the Sublime.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]]. He is Westworld's narrative director, whose artistic temperament aggravates his co-workers. After the host uprising, Sizemore accompanies Maeve on her journey to find her daughter.\n\n===Hector Escaton===\n'''Hector Escaton''' is portrayed by [[Rodrigo Santoro]]. Hector is a host who is a wanted gang leader bent on survival.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lutes|first=Alicia|title=WESTWORLD Gets a Premiere Date and TONS of New Details (at Last!)|url=http://nerdist.com/westworld-gets-a-premiere-date-and-tons-of-new-details-at-last/|work=Nerdist|date=July 30, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731213934/http://nerdist.com/westworld-gets-a-premiere-date-and-tons-of-new-details-at-last/|archive-date=July 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Clementine Pennyfeather===\n'''Clementine Pennyfeather''' is portrayed by [[Angela Sarafyan]]. She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld. In the past, the host has played the El Lazo role. Lawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===El Lazo===\n'''El Lazo''' is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black. However, in trying to convince her father to come with her for medical help, William still believes she is a host, part of Dr. Ford's game, and kills her.\n\nA '''host replica of Emily Grace''' is introduced in season 2. In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]]. Introduced in season 2, he is a host and a Ghost Nation elder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/zahn-mcclarnon-hospitalized-head-injury-westworld-season-2-1202606667/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Actor Zahn McClarnon Hospitalized, Season 2 Production Paused|last=Stedman|first=Alex|work=Variety|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"S2Recurring\">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/westworld-recurring-cast-season-2-1202361538/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Rounds Out Recurring Cast Ahead Of Season 2|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> He has a fearsome reputation in the park, leading raiding parties and taking hosts prisoner. It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb optes to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. Introduced in season 3, he was one of the co-founders of Incite, Inc. along with Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), together creating an [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon to help monitor the private data of citizens. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. When Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself. He is motivated by the destruction of his home city, [[Paris]], in a nuclear explosion.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1; guest season 2), a host and bandit programmed to kill Dolores's father\n* [[Ptolemy Slocum]] as Sylvester (seasons 1\u20132;

human-like \"hosts\" populate several themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez & El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreat their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he is killed during the uprising, a version of his programming is encoded into Maeve's daughter and he is uploaded into the Sublime.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]]. He is Westworld's narrative director, whose artistic temperament aggravates his co-workers. After the host uprising, Sizemore accompanies Maeve on her journey to find her daughter.\n\n===Hector Escaton===\n'''Hector Escaton''' is portrayed by [[Rodrigo Santoro]]. Hector is a host who is a wanted gang leader bent on survival.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lutes|first=Alicia|title=WESTWORLD Gets a Premiere Date and TONS of New Details (at Last!)|url=http://nerdist.com/westworld-gets-a-premiere-date-and-tons-of-new-details-at-last/|work=Nerdist|date=July 30, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731213934/http://nerdist.com/westworld-gets-a-premiere-date-and-tons-of-new-details-at-last/|archive-date=July 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Clementine Pennyfeather===\n'''Clementine Pennyfeather''' is portrayed by [[Angela Sarafyan]]. She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld. In the past, the host has played the El Lazo role. Lawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===El Lazo===\n'''El Lazo''' is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black. However, in trying to convince her father to come with her for medical help, William still believes she is a host, part of Dr. Ford's game, and kills her.\n\nA '''host replica of Emily Grace''' is introduced in season 2. In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]].

It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb optes to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. Introduced in season 3, he was one of the co-founders of Incite, Inc. along with Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), together creating an [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon to help monitor the private data of citizens. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. When Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself. He is motivated by the destruction of his home city, [[Paris]], in a nuclear explosion.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1; guest season 2), a host and bandit programmed

This was followed by a season at the [[Newcastle Knights]], and another in England at [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], with whom he won the 2001 [[Challenge Cup]] Final. In 2020 he was names as an Immortal for St Helens. Since retiring in 2001 he has spent the last 15 years coaching in the NRL mainly as an assistant coach. Teams he has worked at include the Newcastle Knights, Parramatta Eels, New Zealand Warriors and Penrith Panthers.\n\n==Playing career==\nWhile attending Gosford High School, Fairleigh played for the [[Australia national schoolboys rugby league team|Australian Schoolboys team]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=SportingPulse Homepage for Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2130-0-0-0&sID=26424|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=SportingPulse}}</ref> He made his first grade d\u00e9but for the [[North Sydney Bears|Bears]] in round 17 of 1989 and for ten seasons from 1990 was a permanent first grade player and North Sydney stalwart. During this period he was consistently one of the dominant forwards in the NRL. He made his [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] d\u00e9but in game III of 1991, Fairleigh was selected for the New South Wales team on the interchange bench. He was not selected in 1992 but appeared again in 1993 off the interchange bench in games I & II and as a prop-forward in the run-on side of game III.\n\nHe played State of Origin from 1991 to 1997, playing in 10 games. Although not selected for Origin in 1994, Fairleigh won the [[Dally M Medal|Rothman's Medal]] in 1994 for the best and fairest player in the NRL with a record tally of 33 votes. Fairleigh made his Test d\u00e9but for [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] in a [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|one-off test]] against [[France national rugby league team|France]] when [[Bradley Clyde]] withdrew. At the end of the [[1994 NSWRL season]], he was one of the first forwards selected for the [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]].  He appeared in twelve minor tour matches and two Tests, scoring five tries on tour. He had been selected as a reserve for the second Test but withdrew on the morning of the match with a virus. He played in the third Test against Great Britain and in the sole test against France, scoring a try in the 74-0 drubbing. His Origin (and national) representative careers benefitted from the fracas of the [[Super League war]] and he appeared in all three games of the 1995 and 1997 series for a career total of ten appearances for the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|Blues]]. He was also selected in the Australian team to play against Fiji and Papua New Guinea in 1996. In 1996 he was named in the World Team and was named Dally M Second Row of the Year. He was second in the Rothmans Medal in 1996 behind teammate [[Jason Taylor (rugby league)|Jason Taylor]].\n\nFairleigh played a total of 193 games for Norths and played in 3 of their 4 preliminary final losses during the 1990s as the club fell agonizingly short of a grand final appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2015/09/24/top-10-preliminary-final-heartbreaks/|title=Top 10 preliminary final heartbreaks|website=www.nrl.com}}</ref>\n\nFollowing North's merger with [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]] at the end of 1999, Fairleigh moved to Newcastle and was in 2000 named the club's Player of the Year, Players' Player and Coach's Player of the Year. 2001 saw him finish his club career with a season for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in England where he was named in the Super League Dream Team as well being chosen as one of St Helens 100 greatest players. The same year he played in the winning St Helens team in the 100th Challenge Cup Final against Bradford Bulls at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]]. As [[Super League V]] champions, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] played against [[2000 NRL season|2000 NRL]] Premiers, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in the [[2001 World Club Challenge]].

He spent 5 years developing Rugby League in the Cook Islands with a special focus on developing a competitive  International programme. 'The Kukis' going into the 2013 World Cup Tournament had never  won a World Cup match. The team lost to the [[United States national rugby league team|USA]] and [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]], but they won their last match against the Tournament co-hosts [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] creating history for the sport of [[rugby league]] in the [[Cook Islands]]. As part of the World Cup qualification process the Cook Islands beat Samoa in a play-off to enter the Pacific Cup in 2009. The Cook Islands then went on to beat Fiji 24-22 in the Semi Final and were then beaten by Papua New Guinea in the Final. In 2016 Fairleigh took time off from coaching NRL football to give back to grassroots football. In October 2016 he was announced and unveiled as the North Queensland Cowboys new assistant coach.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Alan Whiticker|Whiticker, Alan]] & Hudson, Glen (2006) ''The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players'', Gavin Allen Publishing, Sydney\n* ''Big League's 25 Years of Origin Collectors' Edition'', News Magazines, Surry Hills, Sydney\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=10&num=15290 Saints Heritage Society profile]\n\n{{St Helens - 2001 World Club Challenge winners}}\n{{St. Helens - 2001 Challenge Cup Final winners}}\n{{1994 Kangaroo Tour squad}}\n{{Cook Islands squad 2013 Rugby League World Cup}}\n{{Rothmans Medalists}}\n{{2001 Super League Dream Team}}\n{{North Sydney Bears Team of the 21st Century}}\n  \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairleigh, David}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league players]]\n[[Category:North Sydney Bears players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players]]\n[[Category:Australia national rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:Newcastle Knights players]]\n[[Category:St Helens R.F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league coaches]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Cook Islands national rugby league team coaches]]\n[[Category:New Zealand Warriors coaches]]\n[[Category:Rugby league second-rows]]\n[[Category:Rugby league props]]\n", "name_user": "DFAIRCLOUD", "label": "safe", "comment": "added an achievement and new job discription", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fairleigh"}
