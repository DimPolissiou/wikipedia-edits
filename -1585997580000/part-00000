It showcased her sophomore compilation album, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and visited Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa. Jackson traveled to thirty-five different cities selected by fans, one chosen for each of her number one hits. The tour took an organic and intimate approach, excluding the elaborate theatrics and pyrotechnics her concerts have become infamous for, focusing on her musicality and choreography. Jackson explained the tour to be \"different from anything I have ever done\", adding, \"These concerts are not about special effects. This is a love affair between me and those of you who have supported me and my work for all these years.\" Jackson dedicated an individual song to the audience during every show to commemorate each city.\n\nThe show's intimate aura was praised among critics, many commending Jackson's showmanship in contrast to her more recent contemporaries. The majority of the tour had completely sold out, notably two shows in [[Sydney]], Australia, which sold out within fifteen minutes, in addition to Los Angeles, which sold in under ten minutes, and three shows in London. The tour achieved several attendance records, among the most attended concerts in the [[Reliant Stadium]]'s history and top selling shows of the year in the Philippines. It had also broken the gross for a single performance at a venue located in Tampa, Florida, surpassing a record previously held by [[Mariah Carey]]. Private shows were held in Singapore, Shanghai, London, and Hertfordshire, the latter venue compensating Jackson a substantial amount to perform. An exclusive concert was also held at the Liaisons Au Louvre II Charity Gala in Paris, France, making Jackson the first female pop artist in history to perform at the [[I. M. Pei]] glass pyramid. Professional footage of shows in Singapore and London were filmed but have not been released. Entertainers such as [[Taylor Swift]], [[Joe Jonas]], [[Siti Nurhaliza]], [[Rachel Stevens]], [[Park Jung-min (singer)|Park Jung-Min]], and British boy band [[JLS]] were reported to attend the tour.\n\nSelected dates of the tour's first North American leg from March to April 2011 had ranked forty-fifth in [[Pollstar]]'s Top 50 Worldwide Tours, earning $16 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/Charts2011/071811Top50WorldwideTours.pdf |title=Top 50 Worldwide Tours (01/01/2011 \u2013 06/30/2011) |author= |date=8 July 2011 |work=Pollstar |publisher=Pollstar, Inc. |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> At the end of 2011, the tour placed 62nd on Pollstar's \"Top 100 Worldwide Tours\", earning $26.5 million from 71 shows worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2011/2011YearEndTop100WorldwideTours.pdf |title=Pollstar Top 100 Worldwide Tours 2011 |publisher=[[Pollstar]] |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A building in a city at night that reads \"RADIO CITY\" in all caps lit up in various places around the building|Jackson was inspired to pursue the tour when performing a private concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]].]]\nSeveral years prior, Jackson embarked on her first tour in nearly seven years, the [[Rock Witchu Tour]].

by American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]]. It showcased her sophomore compilation album, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and visited Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa. Jackson traveled to thirty-five different cities selected by fans, one chosen for each of her number one hits. The tour took an organic and intimate approach, excluding the elaborate theatrics and pyrotechnics her concerts have become infamous for, focusing on her musicality and choreography. Jackson explained the tour to be \"different from anything I have ever done\", adding, \"These concerts are not about special effects. This is a love affair between me and those of you who have supported me and my work for all these years.\" Jackson dedicated an individual song to the audience during every show to commemorate each city.\n\nThe show's intimate aura was praised among critics, many commending Jackson's showmanship in contrast to her more recent contemporaries. The majority of the tour had completely sold out, notably two shows in [[Sydney]], Australia, which sold out within fifteen minutes, in addition to Los Angeles, which sold in under ten minutes, and three shows in London. The tour achieved several attendance records, among the most attended concerts in the [[Reliant Stadium]]'s history and top selling shows of the year in the Philippines. It had also broken the gross for a single performance at a venue located in Tampa, Florida, surpassing a record previously held by [[Mariah Carey]]. Private shows were held in Singapore, Shanghai, London, and Hertfordshire, the latter venue compensating Jackson a substantial amount to perform. An exclusive concert was also held at the Liaisons Au Louvre II Charity Gala in Paris, France, making Jackson the first female pop artist in history to perform at the [[I. M. Pei]] glass pyramid. Professional footage of shows in Singapore and London were filmed but have not been released. Entertainers such as [[Taylor Swift]], [[Joe Jonas]], [[Siti Nurhaliza]], [[Rachel Stevens]], [[Park Jung-min (singer)|Park Jung-Min]], and British boy band [[JLS]] were reported to attend the tour.\n\nSelected dates of the tour's first North American leg from March to April 2011 had ranked forty-fifth in [[Pollstar]]'s Top 50 Worldwide Tours, earning $16 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/Charts2011/071811Top50WorldwideTours.pdf |title=Top 50 Worldwide Tours (01/01/2011 \u2013 06/30/2011) |author= |date=8 July 2011 |work=Pollstar |publisher=Pollstar, Inc. |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> At the end of 2011, the tour placed 62nd on Pollstar's \"Top 100 Worldwide Tours\", earning $26.5 million from 71 shows worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2011/2011YearEndTop100WorldwideTours.pdf |title=Pollstar Top 100 Worldwide Tours 2011 |publisher=[[Pollstar]] |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A building in a city at night that reads \"RADIO CITY\" in all caps lit up in various places around the building|Jackson was inspired to pursue the tour when performing a private concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]].]]\nSeveral years prior, Jackson embarked on her first tour in nearly seven years, the [[Rock Witchu Tour]].

Each segment focuses on a different theme based on the song's lyrical content. The show began with a video introduction of Jackson explaining its concept. After this, a music video of the individual song dedicated to the current city is shown. She enters from the back of the audience flaunting a \"[[scythe]]-edged\" haircut in a grey catsuit to perform opening number \"[[The Pleasure Principle (song)|The Pleasure Principle]]\", moving throughout the venue's centerpiece while interacting with the crowd.<ref name=\"Sun\"/> Upon reaching the stage, she performed \"[[Control (Janet Jackson song)|Control]]\", \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\", and \"[[Feedback (Janet Jackson song)|Feedback]]\" before transitioning to \"[[You Want This]]\" and \"[[Alright (Janet Jackson song)|Alright]]\", replicating each song's signature dance moves. A film reel of highlights from Jackson's acting career was played during a brief interlude, including scenes from ''[[Good Times]]'', ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', and ''[[Why Did I Get Married Too?]]''. She reappeared in a diamond-encrusted lavender gown and sat on a stool in center stage to perform several unplugged ballads. The set began with \"[[Nothing (Janet Jackson song)|Nothing]]\" and \"[[Come Back to Me (Janet Jackson song)|Come Back to Me]]\" before closing with \"[[Let's Wait Awhile]]\" and \"[[Again (Janet Jackson song)|Again]]\", briefly pausing to allow the audience to sing several verses in their entirety. \"Janet's Image\", a second video montage consisting of Jackson's most iconic photographs is shown before she returned in a sleeveless black vest. The third set focused on upbeat love songs, beginning with \"[[Doesn't Really Matter]]\" and leading into \"[[Love Will Never Do (Without You)]]\", \"[[When I Think of You]]\", and \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]].\" After a slight pause, she sang \"[[That's the Way Love Goes (Janet Jackson song)|That's the Way Love Goes]].\" The band played an instrumental version of \"What About\" during a costume break. Upon emerging, Jackson segued through a rock-influenced portion in a black jacket, performing \"[[Black Cat (song)|Black Cat]]\" and \"[[If (Janet Jackson song)|If]]\", emulating its music video's iconic choreography. The set closed with \"[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]\" and \"[[Rhythm Nation]].\" Following a final intermission, Jackson and her dancers reappeared in matching white outfits for the show's encore. Her then-most recent number one hit \"[[Make Me (Janet Jackson song)|Make Me]]\" lead the set. followed by the show's finale, \"[[Together Again (Janet Jackson song)|Together Again]].\" Throughout the song, childhood images of her with [[Michael Jackson]] appeared on screens in tribute to his death.
