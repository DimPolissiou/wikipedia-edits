Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into [[political economy]] and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid- to late- 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding [[Op-ed|opinion columns]], special reports, [[Political cartoon|political cartoons]], [[Letter to the editor|reader letters]], cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\n\nThe [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]]. Since its founding, it has supported [[radical centrism]], favoring policies and governments that maintain [[Centrism|centrist politics]]. The newspaper advocates for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]], particularly [[Free market|free markets]], [[free trade]], [[free immigration]] and [[Globalization|globalisation]]. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little [[reporting bias]], rigorous [[Fact-checking|fact checking]] and strict [[copy editing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/04/when-will-magazines-stop-trying-to-copy-the-economist|title=Why Time and Newsweek Will Never Be The Economist|last=Pressman|first=Matt|date=April 20, 2009|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/|title=10 Journalism Brands Where You Find Real Facts Rather Than Alternative Facts|last=Leadership|first=The Berlin School Of Creative|date=February 1, 2017|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> Its extensive use of [[Word play|word play]], [[Subscription (finance)|subscription]] prices, and typical depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations in the [[Western world|Western World]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2019/01/31/why-the-economist-swapped-its-famous-elitist-marketing-emotional-messaging|title=Why The Economist swapped its famous elitist marketing for emotional messaging|last=Burnell|first=Ian|date=31 January 2019|website=The Drum|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jeremy W.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/business/media/09economist.html|title=The Economist Tends Its Sophisticate Garden|date=2010-08-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In line with this, it claims to have influential readership of prominent business leaders and [[Policy|policy-makers]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:James Wilson by Sir John Watson-Gordon.jpg|thumb|Scottish economist [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] founded the newspaper to \"take part in a severe [[Debate|contest between intelligence]], which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2017/contest-letter-editor.html|title=The Contest|last=Lydgate|first=Chris|date=March 1, 2017|website=Reed Magazine|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>]]\n''The Economist'' was founded by the British businessman and banker [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] in 1843, to advance the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a system of import tariffs.<ref>[http://mitpress.typepad.com/mitpresslog/2007/01/from_corn_laws_.html From the Corn Laws to Your Mailbox], The MIT Press Log, 30 January 2007.

The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\n\nThe [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]]. Since its founding, it has supported [[radical centrism]], favoring policies and governments that maintain [[Centrism|centrist politics]].

This variation is too small to have practical consequences in most applications. \n \nUsing the international definition of the [[inch]] as exactly 25.4 [[millimetre]]s, one furlong is 201.168 metres. Five furlongs are about 1 [[kilometre]] ({{convert|5/8|mi|5|disp=out}} is the exact value, according to the international conversion).\n\n==History==\nThe name ''furlong'' derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] words ''{{lang|ang|furh}}'' (furrow) and ''{{lang|ang|lang}}'' (long).<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Furlong |volume=11 |page=358}}</ref> Dating back at least to early [[Anglo-Saxon]] times, it originally referred to the length of the furrow in one [[acre]] of a ploughed [[open-field system|open field]] (a medieval communal field which was divided into strips). The furlong (meaning furrow length) was the distance a team of oxen could plough without resting. This was standardised to be exactly 40 rods or 10 chains. The system of long furrows arose because turning a team of oxen pulling a heavy plough was difficult. This offset the drainage advantages of short furrows and meant furrows were made as long as possible. An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one [[Chain (unit)|chain]] (66 feet or 22 yards) wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an '''acre's length''',<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Winter's Tale]] |first=William |last=Shakespeare |authorlink=William Shakespeare |edition=unabridged|publisher=Courier Dover|year=2000 |isbn=9780486411187| page=5|quotation=footnote 17: ''heat an acre''; run a heat or course of an acre's length, \"acre\" being used as a lineal measure, equivalent to a furlong.}} {{Shakecite|WT|M|1|2}}</ref> though in modern usage an area of one acre can be of any shape.

A furlong was 40 rods; an acre 4 by 40 rods, or 4 rods by 1 furlong, and thus 160 square rods. At the time, the Saxons used the North German foot, which was 10 percent longer than the foot of today. When England changed to the shorter foot in the late 13th century, rods and furlongs remained unchanged, since property boundaries were already defined in rods and furlongs. The only thing that changed was the number of feet and yards in a rod or a furlong, and the number of square feet and square yards in an acre.

The furlong (meaning furrow length) was the distance a team of oxen could plough without resting. This was standardised to be exactly 40 rods or 10 chains. The system of long furrows arose because turning a team of oxen pulling a heavy plough was difficult. This offset the drainage advantages of short furrows and meant furrows were made as long as possible. An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one [[Chain (unit)|chain]] (66 feet or 22 yards) wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an '''acre's length''',<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Winter's Tale]] |first=William |last=Shakespeare |authorlink=William Shakespeare |edition=unabridged|publisher=Courier Dover|year=2000 |isbn=9780486411187| page=5|quotation=footnote 17: ''heat an acre''; run a heat or course of an acre's length, \"acre\" being used as a lineal measure, equivalent to a furlong.}} {{Shakecite|WT|M|1|2}}</ref> though in modern usage an area of one acre can be of any shape.

A furlong was 40 rods; an acre 4 by 40 rods, or 4 rods by 1 furlong, and thus 160 square rods. At the time, the Saxons used the North German foot, which was 10 percent longer than the foot of today. When England changed to the shorter foot in the late 13th century, rods and furlongs remained unchanged, since property boundaries were already defined in rods and furlongs. The only thing that changed was the number of feet and yards in a rod or a furlong, and the number of square feet and square yards in an acre. The definition of the rod went from 15 old feet to {{frac|16|1|2}} new feet, or from 5 old yards to {{frac|5|1|2}} new yards. The furlong went from 600 old feet to 660 new feet, or from 200 old yards to 220 new yards.

Tiruverkadu is currently a western suburb of the Indian city of [[Chennai]]. He was a [[Vellalar]], a caste of agricultural land owners. He is described as great devotee of the god [[Shiva]], the patron god of Shaivism. Murkha Nayanar cultivated devotion for Shiva from his childhood. He used to serve Shiva, by serving Shaivas, the devotees of Shiva. He used to prepare rice with [[ghee]] and various sweet and savoury delicacies and feed the devotees. The saint spent all his wealth in feeding the devotees. He sold all his possessions, including his properties and his slaves.<ref name=\"Dehejia1988\"/><ref name=\"swami\"/>\n\nTo gain wealth and feed the devotees, Murkha turned to gambling and mastered \"the art\". Since people of Tiruverkadu did not want to gamble, he travelled to various towns, gambling and spending the money in serving Shiva and his devotees. He finally reached Tirukkudanthai (present-day [[Kumbakonam]]), home of numerous Shiva temples. To serve a feast to the devotees, he went to the gambling houses of the town. He strategically lost money in the initial rounds, forcing the opponents to gamble more money in the later rounds, winning great amount of money. He used to stab rivals, who cheated or used deception to win or refused to pay after losing.

Tiruverkadu is currently a western suburb of the Indian city of [[Chennai]]. He was a [[Vellalar]], a caste of agricultural land owners. He is described as great devotee of the god [[Shiva]], the patron god of Shaivism. Murkha Nayanar cultivated devotion for Shiva from his childhood. He used to serve Shiva, by serving Shaivas, the devotees of Shiva. He used to prepare rice with [[ghee]] and various sweet and savoury delicacies and feed the devotees. The saint spent all his wealth in feeding the devotees.

Since people of Tiruverkadu did not want to gamble, he travelled to various towns, gambling and spending the money in serving Shiva and his devotees. He finally reached Tirukkudanthai (present-day [[Kumbakonam]]), home of numerous Shiva temples. To serve a feast to the devotees, he went to the gambling houses of the town. He strategically lost money in the initial rounds, forcing the opponents to gamble more money in the later rounds, winning great amount of money. He used to stab rivals, who cheated or used deception to win or refused to pay after losing.

The song, [[hip hop production|produced]] by [[Play-N-Skillz]], features a [[guest appearance]] from fellow American [[rapper]] [[Krayzie Bone]], of [[Bone Thugs n Harmony]]. Its title is often incorrectly assumed to be \"Ridin' Dirty\", due to the chorus. The lyrics concern [[racial profiling]] and [[police brutality]], as well as the [[stereotyping of African-Americans]] driving a vehicle with [[illegal narcotics|drugs]] or other [[contraband]] on the inside (\"Riding dirty\").\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] shows cops abusing their powers, though Chamillionaire does admit to various crimes of this being promoted, including [[DWI]] and [[prostitution]]. He juxtaposes police actions with [[professional wrestling|wrestling]] scenes to show how the police allegedly treat suspects. The music video, filmed in [[Dallas, Texas]], features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Tom Lister Jr.]], [[Wish Bone]], [[Layzie Bone]], [[Play-N-Skillz]], [[Chingo Bling]], [[OG Ron C]], [[Big Tuck]], and Chamillionaire's younger brother Rasaq.\n\n==Reception==\nThe song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the U.S. for two weeks and peaked at number two in the [[United Kingdom]], behind [[Shakira]] when it was released.  At the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]], \"Ridin'\" won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] and received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]]. It was awarded the last [[Best Rap Video]] at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 2006. The song ranked number three on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' \"100 Best Songs of 2006\" and #6 on BET's \"Top 100 Music Videos Of 2006\". It was the best selling ringtone in 2006, with 3.2 million sales, certified by the RIAA as the first multi-platinum Mastertone artist in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/remember-when-ringtone-rap-ruled-the-world-7751438|title=Remember when ringtone rap ruled the world?|first=Brandon|last=Caldwell|work=Houston Press|date=2015-09-11|accessdate=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\nThe song is played after [[Houston Astros]] victories and has also become an [[Internet meme]] in image macros.
