The sport was created in 1882 by [[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d|Jigoro Kano]] (\u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce) as a physical, mental, and moral [[pedagogy]] in Japan. With its origins coming from [[Jujutsu]], Judo's most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either [[Throw (grappling)|throw]] or [[Takedown (grappling)|take down]] an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a [[Pinning hold|pin]], or force an opponent to submit with a [[joint lock]] or a [[Chokehold|choke]]. [[Strike (attack)|Strikes]] and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms ([[kata]], \u5f62) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ([[randori]], \u4e71\u53d6\u308a). Also refereed to as Kan\u014d Jiu-Jitsu until the introduction to the [[Olympic Games]], A judo practitioner is called a '''judoka'''.\n\nThe philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from {{nihongo3|''[[kory\u016b]]''|\u53e4\u6d41||traditional schools}}. Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world, such as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[ARB (martial art)|ARB]].\n\n== History and philosophy ==\n\n=== Early life of the founder ===\n[[File:Kano Jigoro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jigoro Kano]]]]\n\nThe early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[polymath]] and educator {{nihongo3|Jigoro Kano|\u5609\u7d0d \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|[[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d]]|1860\u20131938}}, born {{nihongo3|Jigor\u014d Shinnosuke|\u65b0\u4e4b\u52a9 \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|Shinnosuke Jigor\u014d}}. Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the [[Shinto]] [[Hiyoshi Shrine|Hiyoshi shrine]] in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the [[Bakufu#Shogunate|Shogunal]] government.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nJigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, {{nihongo3|[[Japanese calligraphy]]|\u66f8\u9053|shod\u014d}} and the {{nihongo|[[Four Books#Four Books|Four Confucian Texts]]|\u56db\u66f8|Shisho}} under a number of tutors.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\">Kano (2008) p. 1; Hoare (2009) p. 43</ref> When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in [[Shiba, Tokyo]]. The culture of [[bullying]] endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a {{nihongo3|[[Jujutsu]]|\u67d4\u8853|J\u016bjutsu}} {{nihongo3|[[dojo]]|\u9053\u5834|d\u014dj\u014d|training place}} at which to train.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. <ref>[https://www.recreationtipsy.com/ snooker rules]</ref>43\"/>\n\nEarly attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly [[Westernization|westernized]] Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kan\u014d's father and a former soldier, agreed to show him ''kata'', but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku's second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor, Imai Genshiro of {{nihongo3|''[[Kyushin Ryu|Ky\u016bshin-ry\u016b]]''|\u6271\u5fc3\u6d41}} school of jujutsu, also refused.<ref name=\"Kano (2008) p. 2\">Kano (2008) p. 2</ref> Several years passed before he finally found a willing teacher.<ref name=\"Kano <ref>[https://www.recreationtipsy.com/volleyball-rules/ volleyball rules]</ref>(2008) p. 2\"/>\n\nIn 1877, as a student at the Tokyo-''Kaisei'' school (soon to become part of the newly founded [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]]), Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening {{nihongo3|''Seikotsu-in''|\u6574\u9aa8\u9662||traditional osteopathy practices}}.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 44</ref> After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke (c.1828\u20131880),<ref>Fukuda (2004) p. 145</ref> a teacher of the {{nihongo3|''[[Tenjin Shinyo-ryu|Tenjin Shin'y\u014d-ry\u016b]]''|\u5929\u795e\u771f\u694a\u6d41}} of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat [[dojo]] where he taught five students.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 3\u20134; Hoare (2009) pp. 45\u201347; Fukuda (2004) pp. 145\u2013152.

Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of \"kata\", and entrusted ''randori'' instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 9\u201310</ref> Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to study at the dojo of Iikubo Tsunetoshi (1835\u20131889) of {{nihongo3|''[[Kito-ry\u016b|Kit\u014d-ry\u016b]]''|\u8d77\u5012\u6d41}}.<ref>Kano (2008) p. 11</ref> Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on ''randori'', with ''Kit\u014d-ry\u016b'' having a greater focus on {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}.<ref>Kano (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\n=== Founding of the Kodokan ===\n[[File:Eishoji.JPG|thumb|right|''Eisho-ji'' temple, Tokyo]]\nIn February 1882, Kano founded a school and dojo at the {{nihongo3|''Eisho-ji''|\u6c38\u660c\u5bfa}}, a [[buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of [[Tait\u014d, Tokyo|Tait\u014d]] ward).<ref>Hoare (2009) pp. 52\u201353.

It was a relatively small affair, consisting of a 12 [[Tatami|jo]]<ref>Jo is the Japanese unit of area.</ref> (214 sq ft) training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being [[Tomita Tsunejir\u014d]] and [[Shiro Saigo]].<ref>Kano (2008) p. 20</ref> In August, the following year, the pair were granted {{nihongo3|[[shodan (rank)|shodan]]|\u521d\u6bb5||first rank}} grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.<ref>Lowry (2006) p. 49</ref>\n\n=== Judo versus jujutsu ===\n{{main|Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry}}\nCentral to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of {{nihongo3|''seiryoku zen'y\u014d''|\u7cbe\u529b\u5584\u7528||Maximum efficiency, minimum effort}} and {{nihongo3|''jita ky\u014dei''|\u81ea\u4ed6\u5171\u6804||mutual welfare and benefit}}. He illustrated the application of ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'' with the concept of {{nihongo3|''j\u016b yoku g\u014d o seisu''|\u67d4\u80fd\u304f\u525b\u3092\u5236\u3059 - \u67d4\u80fd\u525b\u5236||softness controls hardness}}:\n[[File:Judo.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.45|{{nihongo3|\"Judo\"|\u67d4\u9053|j\u016bd\u014d}}, written in [[kanji]]]]\n{{quotation|In short, resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat, whilst adjusting to and evading your opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance, his power will be reduced, and you will defeat him. This can apply whatever the relative values of power, thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly stronger ones. This is the theory of ''ju yoku go o seisu''.<ref>Kano (2005) pp. 39\u201340</ref>}}\n\nKano realised that ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'', initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]-influenced ''jita ky\u014dei'', the wider application shaped the development of judo from a {{nihongo3|martial art|\u6b66\u8853|bujutsu}} to a {{nihongo3|martial way|\u6b66\u9053|bud\u014d}}. Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasised the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general.<ref>For Kano's opinions on the wider applicability of ''jita ky\u014dei'' to life see for example, Kano (2008) p. 107</ref> He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of jujutsu:\n\n{{quotation|At the time a few bujitsu (martial arts) experts still existed but bujitsu was almost abandoned by the nation at large. Even if I wanted to teach jujitsu most people had now stopped thinking about it. So I thought it better to teach under a different name principally because my objectives were much wider than jujitsu.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 56</ref>}}\n\nKano believed that \"''j\u016bjutsu''\" was insufficient to describe his art: although {{nihongo3|''jutsu''|\u8853}} means \"art\" or \"means\", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to {{nihongo3|''d\u014d''|\u9053}}, meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than ''jutsu'' and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of ''[[tao]]''. Thus Kano renamed it {{nihongo3|judo|\u67d4\u9053|J\u016bd\u014d}}.<ref>Judo had been used before then, as in the case of a jujutsu school that called itself {{nihongo3|''Chokushin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d''|\u76f4\u4fe1\u6d41\u67d4\u9053||Sometimes rendered as Jikishin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d}}, but its use was rare.</ref>\n\n== Judo ''waza'' (techniques) ==\n{{See also|List of judo techniques|List of Kodokan judo techniques}}\nThere are three basic categories of {{nihongo3|''waza''|\u6280||techniques}} in judo: {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}, {{nihongo3|''katame-waza''|\u56fa\u6280||grappling techniques}} and {{nihongo3|''atemi-waza''|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab\u6280||striking techniques}}.<ref>Daigo (2005) p. 8</ref> Judo is mostly known for ''nage-waza'' and ''katame-waza''.<ref>Numerous texts exist that describe the ''waza'' of judo in detail. Daigo (2005); Inokuma and Sato (1987); Kano (1994); Mifune (2004); and Ohlenkamp (2006) are some of the better examples</ref>\n\nJudo practitioners typically devote a portion of each practice session to {{nihongo3|[[uke (martial arts)|''ukemi'']]|\u53d7\u3051\u8eab||break-falls}}, in order that ''nage-waza'' can be practiced without significant risk of injury. Several distinct types of ''ukemi'' exist, including {{nihongo3|''ushiro ukemi''|\u5f8c\u308d\u53d7\u8eab||rear breakfalls}}; {{nihongo3|''yoko ukemi''|\u6a2a\u53d7\u3051\u8eab||side breakfalls}}; {{nihongo3|''mae ukemi''|\u524d\u53d7\u3051\u8eab||front breakfalls}}; and {{nihongo3|''zenpo kaiten ukemi''|\u524d\u65b9\u56de\u8ee2\u53d7\u8eab||rolling breakfalls}}<ref>Kano (1994) pp. 45\u201354</ref>\n\nThe person who performs a ''Waza'' is known as {{nihongo3|[[tori (martial arts)|''tori'']]|\u53d6\u308a||literally \"taker\"}} and the person to whom it is performed is known as {{nihongo3|[[uke (martial arts)|''uke'']]|\u53d7\u3051||\"receiver\"}}.<ref>Ishikawa and Draeger (1999) p. 179</ref>\n\n=== ''Nage-waza'' (throwing techniques) ===\n''Nage-waza'' include all techniques in which ''tori'' attempts to throw or trip ''uke'', usually with the aim of placing ''uke'' on his back.

In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of nage waza and katame waza, excluding atemi waza. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by \"Throwing\", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by \"Pinning\" them on their back for a \"sufficient\" amount of time, or by Submission, which could be achieved via \"Shime-waza\" or \"Kansetsu-waza\", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\">Hoare (2005) pp. 4\u20137</ref> In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for kyu grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited kansetsu-waza for ''[[dan (rank)|dan]]'' grades. It was also stated that the ratio of tachi-waza to ne-waza should be between 70% to 80% for kyu grades and 60% to 70% for dan grades.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\"/>\n\nIn 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit ''kansetsu waza'' with the prohibition of ''[[ashi garami]]'' and neck locks, as well as ''do jime''.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 109</ref> These were further added to in 1925.\n\nThe first time judo was seen in the [[Olympic Games]] was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/kano.htm |title=The Contribution of Judo to Education by Jigoro Kano |website=Judoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:\n{{quotation|I have been asked by people of various sections as to the wisdom and possibility of judo being introduced with other games and sports at the Olympic Games. My view on the matter, at present, is rather passive. If it be the desire of other member countries, I have no objection. But I do not feel inclined to take any initiative. For one thing, judo in reality is not a mere sport or game. I regard it as a principle of life, art and science. In fact, it is a means for personal cultural attainment. Only one of the forms of judo training, so-called randori or free practice can be classed as a form of sport. Certainly, to some extent, the same may be said of boxing and fencing, but today they are practiced and conducted as sports. Then the Olympic Games are so strongly flavored with nationalism that it is possible to be influenced by it and to develop \"Contest Judo\", a retrograde form as ju-jitsu was before the Kodokan was founded. Judo should be free as art and science from any external influences, political, national, racial, and financial or any other organized interest. And all things connected with it should be directed to its ultimate object, the \"Benefit of Humanity\". Human sacrifice is a matter of ancient history.<ref>Koizumi (1947)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, [[Judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics|judo became an Olympic sport]] for men in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] in [[Tokyo]].

In January 2013, the Hantei was removed and the \"Golden Score\" no longer has a time limit. The match would continue until a judoka scored through a technique or if the opponent is penalised (Shido).\n\n==== Penalties ====\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. A shido (\u6307\u5c0e - literally \"guidance\") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (\u53cd\u5247\u8ca0\u3051 - literally \"foul-play defeat\"), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make.

The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano's original style of judo, several related forms have evolved\u2014some now widely considered to be distinct arts:\n\n* {{nihongo3|[[Kosen judo]]|\u9ad8\u5c08\u67d4\u9053}}: Sometimes erroneously described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University.<ref>Kashiwazaki (1997) pp. 14\u201315</ref> The word \"Kosen\" is an acronym of {{nihongo3|Koto Senmon Gakko|\u9ad8\u7b49\u5c02\u9580\u5b66\u6821||literally \"Higher Professional School\"}}. Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].\n* Russian judo: This distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Russian martial art called [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]. It is represented by well-known coaches such as [[Alexander Retuinskih]] and [[Igor Yakimov]], and [[mixed martial arts]] fighters such as [[Fedor Emelianenko]] and [[Karo Parisyan]]. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the [[flying armbar]] being accepted into Kodokan judo.\n* [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] (especially Sport Sambo): a derivative of Judo combined with  [[wrestling]] techniques, and striking in case of [[Combat Sambo]]. [[Vasili Oshchepkov]] was the first European judo black belt under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and [[Soviet bloc]] wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov died during the political [[Great Purge|purges]] of 1937. In their ''History of Sambo'', Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia \"judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing\"\u2014albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/stratfordsombo/articles/history-2.html |title=The History of Sombo |website=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n* [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]]\n* Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the US, that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules.<ref>[http://image.aausports.org/dnn/judo/2016/2016JudoHandbook.pdf Judo handbook (PDF)]</ref> Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA).

The most well-known Pangamot training hall is the World Doce Pares  [[Doce Pares]] Headquarters in Cebu City, Philippines. The head Pangamot instructor between 1955 and 2017 was Judo 8th Dan and Eskrima World Champion, Ciriaco \"Cacoy\" Canete [[Ciriaco Ca\u00f1ete|Ciriaco Canete]]. American Pangamot instructors include former Army Ranger, Christopher J. Petrilli, mixed martial arts coach Thomas Weissmuller, and UFC Coach, Ray Yee.\n\n== Safety ==\nKano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. [[Randori]] (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kano|first=Jigoro|title=The Contribution of Judo to Education|url=http://judoinfo.com/kano1.htm|website=Judoinfo.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from [[Jujutsu]], were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in [[ukemi]] (break falls) and practiced on [[tatami]] (rice straw mats).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Kansetsu'' and ''shime waza'' ===\nThe application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dojo and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Nage waza'' ===\nSafety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the [[List of Kodokan judo techniques|''Gokyo'']] {{nihongo3||\u4e94\u6559||literally \"five teachings\"}}, a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in {{nihongo3|''Dai ikkyo''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6559||literally \"first teaching\"}} are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in {{nihongo3|''dai gokyo'' |\u7b2c\u4e94\u6559||literally \"fifth teaching\"}} are difficult to breakfall from.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Judoka (practitioner) ==\nA practitioner of judo is known as a {{nihongo3|judoka|\u67d4\u9053\u5bb6}}. The modern meaning of \"judoka\" in English is a judo practitioner of any level of expertise,<ref name=\"Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253\">Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253</ref> but traditionally those below the rank of 4th ''dan'' were called {{nihongo3|''kenkyu-sei''|\u7814\u7a76\u751f||trainees}}; and only those of 4th ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' or higher were called \"judoka\". (The suffix {{nihongo3|''-ka''|\u5bb6}}, when added to a noun, means a person with expertise or special knowledge on that subject).\n\nA judo teacher is called {{nihongo3|''[[sensei]]''|\u5148\u751f}}.<ref name=\"Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253\"/> The word ''sensei'' comes from ''sen'' or ''saki'' (before) and ''sei'' (life)&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. one who has preceded you. In Western dojo, it is common to call an instructor of any ''dan'' grade ''sensei''. Traditionally, that title was reserved for instructors of 4th ''dan'' and above.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World of Martial Arts|last=Hill|first=Robert|publisher=LuLu Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-557-01663-1|location=128 Valley Ln London, Kentucky|pages=Chapter 8}}</ref>\n\n== Judogi (uniform) ==\n{{Main|Judogi}}\n[[File:Judo orange belt (Brusselsshrek).JPG|thumb|left|The judogi is made from a heavy weave to withstand the strength of throwing and grappling.]]\nJudo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called {{nihongo3|[[keikogi]]||\u7a3d\u53e4\u7740|keikogi|practice clothing}} or {{nihongo3|[[judogi]]|\u67d4\u9053\u7740|j\u016bd\u014dgi|judo clothing}}<ref>Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253; Lowry (2006) pp. 35\u201361</ref> sometimes abbreviated in the west as \"gi\".

In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue because of the fact that judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.<ref name=\"judogi\" />\n\nFor events organized under the auspices of the International judo Federation (IJF), judogi have to bear the IJF Official Logo Mark Label.

On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded [[Keiko Fukuda]] the rank of 10th ''dan'', who was the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.\n\nAlthough ''dan'' ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the ''ky\u016b'' grades, with some countries having more ''ky\u016b'' grades. Although initially ''ky\u016b'' grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a [[dan rank]] in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in [[kimono]], only [[white belt|white]] and black obi were used.

The sport was created in 1882 by [[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d|Jigoro Kano]] (\u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce) as a physical, mental, and moral [[pedagogy]] in Japan. With its origins coming from [[Jujutsu]], Judo's most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either [[Throw (grappling)|throw]] or [[Takedown (grappling)|take down]] an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a [[Pinning hold|pin]], or force an opponent to submit with a [[joint lock]] or a [[Chokehold|choke]]. [[Strike (attack)|Strikes]] and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms ([[kata]], \u5f62) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ([[randori]], \u4e71\u53d6\u308a). Also refereed to as Kan\u014d Jiu-Jitsu until the introduction to the [[Olympic Games]], A judo practitioner is called a '''judoka'''.\n\nThe philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from {{nihongo3|''[[kory\u016b]]''|\u53e4\u6d41||traditional schools}}. Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world, such as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[ARB (martial art)|ARB]].\n\n== History and philosophy ==\n\n=== Early life of the founder ===\n[[File:Kano Jigoro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jigoro Kano]]]]\n\nThe early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[polymath]] and educator {{nihongo3|Jigoro Kano|\u5609\u7d0d \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|[[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d]]|1860\u20131938}}, born {{nihongo3|Jigor\u014d Shinnosuke|\u65b0\u4e4b\u52a9 \u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce|Shinnosuke Jigor\u014d}}. Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the [[Shinto]] [[Hiyoshi Shrine|Hiyoshi shrine]] in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the [[Bakufu#Shogunate|Shogunal]] government.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nJigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, {{nihongo3|[[Japanese calligraphy]]|\u66f8\u9053|shod\u014d}} and the {{nihongo|[[Four Books#Four Books|Four Confucian Texts]]|\u56db\u66f8|Shisho}} under a number of tutors.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\">Kano (2008) p. 1; Hoare (2009) p. 43</ref> When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in [[Shiba, Tokyo]]. The culture of [[bullying]] endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a {{nihongo3|[[Jujutsu]]|\u67d4\u8853|J\u016bjutsu}} {{nihongo3|[[dojo]]|\u9053\u5834|d\u014dj\u014d|training place}} at which to train.<ref name=\"Kano 2008, p. 1; Hoare 2009, p. 43\"/>\n\nEarly attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly [[Westernization|westernized]] Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kan\u014d's father and a former soldier, agreed to show him ''kata'', but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku's second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor, Imai Genshiro of {{nihongo3|''[[Kyushin Ryu|Ky\u016bshin-ry\u016b]]''|\u6271\u5fc3\u6d41}} school of jujutsu, also refused.<ref name=\"Kano (2008) p. 2\">Kano (2008) p. 2</ref> Several years passed before he finally found a willing teacher.<ref name=\"Kano <ref>[https://www.recreationtipsy.com/volleyball-rules/ volleyball rules]</ref>(2008) p. 2\"/>\n\nIn 1877, as a student at the Tokyo-''Kaisei'' school (soon to become part of the newly founded [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]]), Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening {{nihongo3|''Seikotsu-in''|\u6574\u9aa8\u9662||traditional osteopathy practices}}.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 44</ref> After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke (c.1828\u20131880),<ref>Fukuda (2004) p. 145</ref> a teacher of the {{nihongo3|''[[Tenjin Shinyo-ryu|Tenjin Shin'y\u014d-ry\u016b]]''|\u5929\u795e\u771f\u694a\u6d41}} of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat [[dojo]] where he taught five students.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 3\u20134; Hoare (2009) pp. 45\u201347; Fukuda (2004) pp. 145\u2013152.

Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of \"kata\", and entrusted ''randori'' instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano.<ref>Kano (2008) pp. 9\u201310</ref> Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to study at the dojo of Iikubo Tsunetoshi (1835\u20131889) of {{nihongo3|''[[Kito-ry\u016b|Kit\u014d-ry\u016b]]''|\u8d77\u5012\u6d41}}.<ref>Kano (2008) p. 11</ref> Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on ''randori'', with ''Kit\u014d-ry\u016b'' having a greater focus on {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}.<ref>Kano (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\n=== Founding of the Kodokan ===\n[[File:Eishoji.JPG|thumb|right|''Eisho-ji'' temple, Tokyo]]\nIn February 1882, Kano founded a school and dojo at the {{nihongo3|''Eisho-ji''|\u6c38\u660c\u5bfa}}, a [[buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of [[Tait\u014d, Tokyo|Tait\u014d]] ward).<ref>Hoare (2009) pp. 52\u201353.

It was a relatively small affair, consisting of a 12 [[Tatami|jo]]<ref>Jo is the Japanese unit of area.</ref> (214 sq ft) training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being [[Tomita Tsunejir\u014d]] and [[Shiro Saigo]].<ref>Kano (2008) p. 20</ref> In August, the following year, the pair were granted {{nihongo3|[[shodan (rank)|shodan]]|\u521d\u6bb5||first rank}} grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.<ref>Lowry (2006) p. 49</ref>\n\n=== Judo versus jujutsu ===\n{{main|Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry}}\nCentral to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of {{nihongo3|''seiryoku zen'y\u014d''|\u7cbe\u529b\u5584\u7528||Maximum efficiency, minimum effort}} and {{nihongo3|''jita ky\u014dei''|\u81ea\u4ed6\u5171\u6804||mutual welfare and benefit}}. He illustrated the application of ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'' with the concept of {{nihongo3|''j\u016b yoku g\u014d o seisu''|\u67d4\u80fd\u304f\u525b\u3092\u5236\u3059 - \u67d4\u80fd\u525b\u5236||softness controls hardness}}:\n[[File:Judo.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.45|{{nihongo3|\"Judo\"|\u67d4\u9053|j\u016bd\u014d}}, written in [[kanji]]]]\n{{quotation|In short, resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat, whilst adjusting to and evading your opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance, his power will be reduced, and you will defeat him. This can apply whatever the relative values of power, thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly stronger ones. This is the theory of ''ju yoku go o seisu''.<ref>Kano (2005) pp. 39\u201340</ref>}}\n\nKano realised that ''seiryoku zen'y\u014d'', initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]-influenced ''jita ky\u014dei'', the wider application shaped the development of judo from a {{nihongo3|martial art|\u6b66\u8853|bujutsu}} to a {{nihongo3|martial way|\u6b66\u9053|bud\u014d}}. Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasised the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general.<ref>For Kano's opinions on the wider applicability of ''jita ky\u014dei'' to life see for example, Kano (2008) p. 107</ref> He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of jujutsu:\n\n{{quotation|At the time a few bujitsu (martial arts) experts still existed but bujitsu was almost abandoned by the nation at large. Even if I wanted to teach jujitsu most people had now stopped thinking about it. So I thought it better to teach under a different name principally because my objectives were much wider than jujitsu.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 56</ref>}}\n\nKano believed that \"''j\u016bjutsu''\" was insufficient to describe his art: although {{nihongo3|''jutsu''|\u8853}} means \"art\" or \"means\", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to {{nihongo3|''d\u014d''|\u9053}}, meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than ''jutsu'' and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of ''[[tao]]''. Thus Kano renamed it {{nihongo3|judo|\u67d4\u9053|J\u016bd\u014d}}.<ref>Judo had been used before then, as in the case of a jujutsu school that called itself {{nihongo3|''Chokushin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d''|\u76f4\u4fe1\u6d41\u67d4\u9053||Sometimes rendered as Jikishin-ry\u016b J\u016bd\u014d}}, but its use was rare.</ref>\n\n== Judo ''waza'' (techniques) ==\n{{See also|List of judo techniques|List of Kodokan judo techniques}}\nThere are three basic categories of {{nihongo3|''waza''|\u6280||techniques}} in judo: {{nihongo3|''nage-waza''|\u6295\u3052\u6280||throwing techniques}}, {{nihongo3|''katame-waza''|\u56fa\u6280||grappling techniques}} and {{nihongo3|''atemi-waza''|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab\u6280||striking techniques}}.<ref>Daigo (2005) p. 8</ref> Judo is mostly known for ''nage-waza'' and ''katame-waza''.<ref>Numerous texts exist that describe the ''waza'' of judo in detail.

In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of nage waza and katame waza, excluding atemi waza. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by \"Throwing\", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by \"Pinning\" them on their back for a \"sufficient\" amount of time, or by Submission, which could be achieved via \"Shime-waza\" or \"Kansetsu-waza\", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\">Hoare (2005) pp. 4\u20137</ref> In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for kyu grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited kansetsu-waza for ''[[dan (rank)|dan]]'' grades. It was also stated that the ratio of tachi-waza to ne-waza should be between 70% to 80% for kyu grades and 60% to 70% for dan grades.<ref name=\"judoruleshistory\"/>\n\nIn 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit ''kansetsu waza'' with the prohibition of ''[[ashi garami]]'' and neck locks, as well as ''do jime''.<ref>Hoare (2009) p. 109</ref> These were further added to in 1925.\n\nThe first time judo was seen in the [[Olympic Games]] was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/kano.htm |title=The Contribution of Judo to Education by Jigoro Kano |website=Judoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:\n{{quotation|I have been asked by people of various sections as to the wisdom and possibility of judo being introduced with other games and sports at the Olympic Games. My view on the matter, at present, is rather passive. If it be the desire of other member countries, I have no objection. But I do not feel inclined to take any initiative. For one thing, judo in reality is not a mere sport or game. I regard it as a principle of life, art and science. In fact, it is a means for personal cultural attainment. Only one of the forms of judo training, so-called randori or free practice can be classed as a form of sport. Certainly, to some extent, the same may be said of boxing and fencing, but today they are practiced and conducted as sports. Then the Olympic Games are so strongly flavored with nationalism that it is possible to be influenced by it and to develop \"Contest Judo\", a retrograde form as ju-jitsu was before the Kodokan was founded. Judo should be free as art and science from any external influences, political, national, racial, and financial or any other organized interest. And all things connected with it should be directed to its ultimate object, the \"Benefit of Humanity\". Human sacrifice is a matter of ancient history.<ref>Koizumi (1947)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, [[Judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics|judo became an Olympic sport]] for men in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] in [[Tokyo]].

Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (\u53cd\u5247\u8ca0\u3051 - literally \"foul-play defeat\"), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make. If hansoku-make is awarded for a major rule infringement, it results not just in loss of the match, but in the expulsion from the tournament of the penalized player.\n\n== In mixed martial arts ==\n{{main|Mixed martial arts}}\nSeveral judo practitioners have made an impact in [[mixed martial arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/7/15/4502360/ufc-mma-fans-guide-to-grappling-olympic-judo-ronda-rousey-highlights-video |title=MMA Fan's Guide to Grappling: Judo |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Anthony Fusco |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1303377-judo-the-gentile-way-why-judo-is-so-underrated-in-mma-today |title=Judo \"The Gentle Way\": Why Judo Is so Underrated in MMA Today |website=Bleacher Report |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Snowden |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1134250-the-gentle-way-strikeforce-champion-ronda-rousey-and-the-birth-of-a-judo-star |title=The Gentle Way: Strikeforce Champion Ronda Rousey and the Birth of a Judo Star |website=Bleacher Report |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> Notable judo-trained MMA fighters include Olympic medalists [[Hidehiko Yoshida]] (Gold, 1992), [[Naoya Ogawa]] (Silver, 1992), [[Pawe\u0142 Nastula]] (Gold, 1996), [[Makoto Takimoto]] (Gold, 2000), [[Satoshi Ishii]] (Gold, 2008) and [[Ronda Rousey]] (Bronze, 2008), former Russian national judo championship Bronze medalist [[Fedor Emelianenko]], [[Yoshihiro Akiyama]], [[Don Frye]], [[Rick Hawn]], [[Dan Kelly (fighter)|Daniel Kelly]], [[Hector Lombard]], [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]], [[Karo Parisyan]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Silva (fighter)|Ant\u00f4nio Silva]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Dong-Sik Yoon]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Snowden |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1141554-the-gentle-way-part-ii-olympians-ronda-rousey-and-rick-hawn-adapt-to-mma |title=The Gentle Way Part II: Olympians Ronda Rousey and Rick Hawn Adapt to MMA |website=Bleacher Report |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Matt |url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/07/is-ronda-rousey-the-savior-judo-has-been-waiting-for |title=Is Ronda Rousey the savior judo has been waiting for? |website=MMAjunkie.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Alternative rulesets and derivative martial arts ==\nKano Jigoro's Kodokan judo is the most popular and well-known style of judo, but is not the only one. The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano's original style of judo, several related forms have evolved\u2014some now widely considered to be distinct arts:\n\n* {{nihongo3|[[Kosen judo]]|\u9ad8\u5c08\u67d4\u9053}}: Sometimes erroneously described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University.<ref>Kashiwazaki (1997) pp. 14\u201315</ref> The word \"Kosen\" is an acronym of {{nihongo3|Koto Senmon Gakko|\u9ad8\u7b49\u5c02\u9580\u5b66\u6821||literally \"Higher Professional School\"}}. Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].\n* Russian judo: This distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Russian martial art called [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]. It is represented by well-known coaches such as [[Alexander Retuinskih]] and [[Igor Yakimov]], and [[mixed martial arts]] fighters such as [[Fedor Emelianenko]] and [[Karo Parisyan]]. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the [[flying armbar]] being accepted into Kodokan judo.\n* [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] (especially Sport Sambo): a derivative of Judo combined with  [[wrestling]] techniques, and striking in case of [[Combat Sambo]]. [[Vasili Oshchepkov]] was the first European judo black belt under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and [[Soviet bloc]] wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov died during the political [[Great Purge|purges]] of 1937. In their ''History of Sambo'', Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia \"judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing\"\u2014albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/stratfordsombo/articles/history-2.html |title=The History of Sombo |website=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n* [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]]\n* Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the US, that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules.<ref>[http://image.aausports.org/dnn/judo/2016/2016JudoHandbook.pdf Judo handbook (PDF)]</ref> Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA).

The most well-known Pangamot training hall is the World Doce Pares  [[Doce Pares]] Headquarters in Cebu City, Philippines. The head Pangamot instructor between 1955 and 2017 was Judo 8th Dan and Eskrima World Champion, Ciriaco \"Cacoy\" Canete [[Ciriaco Ca\u00f1ete|Ciriaco Canete]]. American Pangamot instructors include former Army Ranger, Christopher J. Petrilli, mixed martial arts coach Thomas Weissmuller, and UFC Coach, Ray Yee.\n\n== Safety ==\nKano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. [[Randori]] (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kano|first=Jigoro|title=The Contribution of Judo to Education|url=http://judoinfo.com/kano1.htm|website=Judoinfo.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from [[Jujutsu]], were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in [[ukemi]] (break falls) and practiced on [[tatami]] (rice straw mats).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Kansetsu'' and ''shime waza'' ===\nThe application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dojo and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== ''Nage waza'' ===\nSafety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the [[List of Kodokan judo techniques|''Gokyo'']] {{nihongo3||\u4e94\u6559||literally \"five teachings\"}}, a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in {{nihongo3|''Dai ikkyo''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6559||literally \"first teaching\"}} are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in {{nihongo3|''dai gokyo'' |\u7b2c\u4e94\u6559||literally \"fifth teaching\"}} are difficult to breakfall from.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Judoka (practitioner) ==\nA practitioner of judo is known as a {{nihongo3|judoka|\u67d4\u9053\u5bb6}}. The modern meaning of \"judoka\" in English is a judo practitioner of any level of expertise,<ref name=\"Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253\">Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253</ref> but traditionally those below the rank of 4th ''dan'' were called {{nihongo3|''kenkyu-sei''|\u7814\u7a76\u751f||trainees}}; and only those of 4th ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' or higher were called \"judoka\". (The suffix {{nihongo3|''-ka''|\u5bb6}}, when added to a noun, means a person with expertise or special knowledge on that subject).\n\nA judo teacher is called {{nihongo3|''[[sensei]]''|\u5148\u751f}}.<ref name=\"Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253\"/> The word ''sensei'' comes from ''sen'' or ''saki'' (before) and ''sei'' (life)&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. one who has preceded you. In Western dojo, it is common to call an instructor of any ''dan'' grade ''sensei''. Traditionally, that title was reserved for instructors of 4th ''dan'' and above.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World of Martial Arts|last=Hill|first=Robert|publisher=LuLu Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-557-01663-1|location=128 Valley Ln London, Kentucky|pages=Chapter 8}}</ref>\n\n== Judogi (uniform) ==\n{{Main|Judogi}}\n[[File:Judo orange belt (Brusselsshrek).JPG|thumb|left|The judogi is made from a heavy weave to withstand the strength of throwing and grappling.]]\nJudo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called {{nihongo3|[[keikogi]]||\u7a3d\u53e4\u7740|keikogi|practice clothing}} or {{nihongo3|[[judogi]]|\u67d4\u9053\u7740|j\u016bd\u014dgi|judo clothing}}<ref>Inokuma and Sato (1987) p. 253; Lowry (2006) pp. 35\u201361</ref> sometimes abbreviated in the west as \"gi\".

Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue because of the fact that judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.<ref name=\"judogi\" />\n\nFor events organized under the auspices of the International judo Federation (IJF), judogi have to bear the IJF Official Logo Mark Label.

On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded [[Keiko Fukuda]] the rank of 10th ''dan'', who was the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.\n\nAlthough ''dan'' ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the ''ky\u016b'' grades, with some countries having more ''ky\u016b'' grades. Although initially ''ky\u016b'' grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a [[dan rank]] in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in [[kimono]], only [[white belt|white]] and black obi were used.

A [[PlayStation Portable]] version was released on October 17, 2007. [[GameCube]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions were planned, but both were cancelled due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.\n\nThe game's plot expands on the film by including additional characters and elements from the [[Spider-Man]] comic books and the [[Marvel Universe]]. Depending on the platform, different villains from the comics are featured, but all versions of the game feature the film's three main antagonists: [[Harry Osborn|New Goblin]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Eddie Brock|Venom]].\n\n[[Tobey Maguire]], [[James Franco]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] reprised their roles from the film. [[Kirsten Dunst]], who portrayed [[Mary Jane Watson]] in the film, is replaced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. Some characters from the film do not appear in the game, namely [[Aunt May]], [[Gwen Stacy|Gwen]] and Captain [[George Stacy]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n===Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3===\n[[Image:Spider-man 3 360.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A shot of Spider-Man in his black suit, created by the alien symbiote.|alt=]]\n\nThe most conspicuous difference in these versions is where you cannot alternate between suits at will, similar to how the Prince cannot control his transformation into the Dark Prince in the Ubisoft title ''[[Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones]]''. Instead, you alternate between suits as you progress through the story. The upgrade system is different compared to earlier titles as well. Upgrades will be unlocked only as you progress and cannot be purchased. Collectables can be found in the form of tokens, which are scattered everywhere throughout the city, from skyscrapers to the subway tunnels. Once you have completed all the story missions, you are given a New Game + option. This will allow you to replay all the story missions in the black suit only. You can switch between suits via the pause menu. ''Spider-Man 3'' is the first Spider-Man title to introduce quick-time events, a mechanic where you have to follow the corresponding controls on-screen to progress. Like many other PC games, the PC version can be modified, although very few mods for this game have been produced. Scorpion, Rhino, and Kingpin are exclusive villains to this version.\n\nThe player is also granted temporary access to play as New Goblin during the final mission in the game in a boss fight against Sandman, until he became a full playable character exclusive to PlayStation 3's Collectors Edition of the game, then as downloadable content for both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. In the PC version's modifications, New Goblin's free roam gameplay is similar to his PlayStation Network/Xbox Live's downloadable content counterpart, such as having no story missions, except it has no challenge missions.\n\nOutside PC modifications, in all three versions, Peter Parker is also playable through a glitch, but some of your abilities are lost due to some of the glitch's bugs. However, you can overcome these bugs if you complete a certain side mission.\n\n===PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable===\nThe versions developed by Vicarious Visions differ from the versions developed by Treyarch. Most notably the recycled cutscenes and similar story missions, as well as the open-world hub and challenges. In the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, the black suit can be put on at will and works similar to Hypermode in ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', although there is a [[cooldown]] period after using it, instead of a health cost.  The black suit will enhance the player's attacks and health, but if the player uses it for too long, Spider-Man can be permanently corrupted by the black suit, leading to a non-standard [[game over]].  To free Spider-Man from the black suit, the player must perform a series of quick-time events to turn him back to normal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/spider-man-3-review-4?page=2|title=Spider-Man 3 (Wii) IGN review|last1=Casamassina|first1=Matt|website=IGN}}</ref>  Much like ''Spider-Man 2'', you have an upgrade system, where you can purchase unlocked upgrades as you progress. Upgrades are purchased with Hero Points. You earn these points by completing the main story missions, or the side missions. The black suit cannot be upgraded. Like other Spider-Man titles, there are side missions that can appear at random. These missions can range from muggings to delivering items such as fruit pies. The side missions however are activated through a radio transmission which gives you the option of doing the mentioned mission or not. This has never been done in any Spider-Man game before. Much like the next-gen versions, there is a crime wave mechanic, where on the overhead map displays the gangs throughout the city. To lower the crime wave, you must complete combat tours where you have to complete tasks similar to the side missions of the game. As you progress the combat tours the gangs will lose control, giving the NYPD an advantage. If however, you ignore the combat tours the gangs will take over more parts of the city as well as other gangs. This will affect the open-world hub with a new environmental mechanic. Similar to ''Spider-Man 2'' and ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', there are collectables. The only collectibles you can find, however, are the Meteorites and Spider Emblems. These are scattered throughout the city. Spider Emblems can only be found once you complete the story missions. Once you find them all you will unlock the black suit. The Combat System is much more similar to Ultimate Spider-Man than Spider-Man 2, such as lacking of mid-air combos from Spider-Man 2.\n\nThe primary features for the Wii version are motion controls. By flicking the Wii Remote & Nunchuck, the player can perform various actions such as combat, and one of Spider-Man's trademark abilities: Web Swinging. There are also certain mini-games tailored to the motion controls. This can range from disarming a bomb, to completing quick time events. The PlayStation Portable version is a full-on port of the PlayStation 2 version with an extra feature exclusive to the handheld known as \"Conquest Mode\". Conquest Mode is an extra mode where the player has only a very limited amount of time to traverse the city and complete challenges such as combat tours, delivering items, and protecting civilians. The more challenges are completed, the more \"hero points\" the player earns. Once time has elapsed, the score is calculated and the most recent save is loaded; the mission can be replayed any time to get a higher score. Conquest Mode can be exited with a visit to the Daily Bugle building in order to return to the main game. Conquest Mode can be accessed via the title screen or Scrapbook.\n\n===Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS===\nThe Game Boy Advance version is a [[side-scrolling]] action game. While the characters are seen [[2.5D]], everything else is 2D. It exacts the storyline of the film. A map is used to enter levels. (?) bubbles during levels give hints.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version and the Game Boy Advance version differ, but is side-scrolling and completely 2.5D. It uses the Touch Screen to execute most attacks.  In this version, players can put on the black suit at will, and it can only help them.  However, that suit will be disabled if Spider-Man's health is too low.  This version supports wireless multiplayer.\n\n==Plot==\n===Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3===\nAbout a year after the events of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|previous game]], Spider-Man stops a new gang, the H-Bombers, from blowing up the Carlyle building. The next day, Peter Parker narrates: \"Just another day in the life of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! Lately, things have been going my way. I got the girl, and New York finally likes me. Not that there aren't problems: There is this new guy [[Eddie Brock]] at the [[Daily Bugle]], and he is really starting to get on my nerves. [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], my best friend, won't talk to me. On top of that, new gangs have been dividing up the city. Still, it's nothing I can't handle. One weird thing, there hasn't been any big supervillain around since [[Doctor Octopus|Doc Ock]]. I have this bad feeling that the sky is gonna fall or something, and soon...\"\n\nBesides his job for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', where he receives several assignments from his boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], such as having to photograph some lizard people spotted across the city, Spider-Man must face three new gangs terrorizing the city: the Apocalypse, Arsenic Candies, and Dragon Tails. He manages to foil their plans several times, and even defeats the Apocalypse's leader, while also dealing with the H-Bombers, who attempt to blow up the subway. After a long day of fighting crime, Spider-Man takes [[Mary Jane Watson]], his girlfriend, on a thrill ride, stopping in Central Park to about Harry, who believes Peter murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. As they talk, an alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] inside a meteor crashes nearby and attaches itself to Peter's shoe, while Harry enters his father's secret [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] lair, donning his armor and gear and assuming the identity of \"New Goblin\". At the same time, [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] makes experiments on himself with a lizard DNA serum, in the hopes of regrowing his right arm, only to transform into the Lizard. While investigating Connors' lab, Peter learns what happened, before being attacked by the Lizard. Pursuing him into the sewers, Spider-Man faces numerous other people infected by the Lizard, before finally facing him and foiling his plan to release the lizard people into the city, although the Lizard escapes deeper into the sewers. After returning to college, Peter is attacked by New Goblin, who wants to avenge his father's death. Peter defeats him, knocking him unconscious, and brings him to a hospital to recover. Elsewhere, an escaped convict named [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] tries to escape from police and falls into a cockpit full of sand, where scientists are doing experiments on sand, one of which fuses Flint with the sand, turning him into Sandman.\n\nThe following day, Spider-Man once again foils the H-Bombers' plans, learning that their leader is businessman [[Luke Carlyle]] in the process, and helps Detective [[Jean DeWolff|Jean DeWolfe]] investigate several arms deals and crooked cops in exchange for information on the H-Bombers. His conflict with the gang culminates with an attack on the ''Daily Bugle'', where Spider-Man saves a kidnapped Jameson and destroys the Bombers' helicopter, although Carlyle manages to escape. At the same time, Spider-Man investigates science corporation MechaBioCon (MBC) to learn about its connection with [[Mac Gargan|Mac Gargan/Scorpion]] (whom Spider-Man already encountered [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|three years prior]]), after witnessing him freeing [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] from a police van (whom Spider-Man also fought [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|one year ago]]). He soon learns that Gargan sought the help of head scientist [[Farley Stillwell|Dr. Stillwell]] to remove his armor, only for Stillwell to place him under her control and assign him to various illegal missions for MBC. Spider-Man eventually saves Scorpion, who gets mind-controlled into attacking him, but nonetheless defeats him and destroys the mind-controlling device, freeing Gargan and earning his gratefulness.\n\nReturning home, Peter falls asleep, during which the symbiote envelops his body, leading to a brand new black Spider-Man suit, which increases his powers to new levels, but also his aggressivity. He then spots Sandman robbing a bank and pursues him to the subway, defeating him. However, the symbiote causes him to violently flush Sandman away, seemingly killing him. The next day, both Peter and Eddie Brock receive the same assignment: catch Spider-Man robbing something, and the one who does it first gets a promotion. Brock attempts to cheat by paying someone to pose as Spider-Man, but the real Spider-Man arrives to foil his plan, punching Brock in the face, who then swears revenge against both Spider-Man and Peter.\n\nSpider-Man returns to the sewers in his search for the Lizard and fights [[Kraven the Hunter]], who is trying to hunt the Lizard. As Spider-Man defeats Kraven, who escapes, his partner [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]] uses her magic to transform the Lizard into a giant monster, dubbed \"Mega-Lizard\". Spider-Man defeats Mega-Lizard, restoring it back into Connors, but he does this in such a violent manner that he becomes concerned about the black suit. Later, Spider-Man foils both the Arsenic Candies and Dragon Tails' plans, while also defeating their respective leaders. He then receives an assignment to take photos of the police's speech about the gangs' defeat at the courthouse, only to witness [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] releasing the three gang leaders and making off with them, in order to unite the gangs in an attempt to kill Spider-Man. That evening, Spider-Man goes to face Kingpin at his lair, defeating both him and the gang leaders. However, the symbiote makes him very aggressive once again and he throws Kingpin off a window, seemingly killing him.\n\nLater that night, after a horrible date with Mary Jane, where the symbiote makes Peter very aggressive, she decides to call off the relationship. Saddened, Spider-Man realizes the negative influence the symbiote has on his behavior and goes to a church, where he removes it using the bell's sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote attaches to Brock instead, who followed Peter and watched him unmask himself, turning him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\nBack to his senses, Spider-Man helps both a recovered Connors restore all the remaining lizard people back to normal, and Scorpion to exact revenge on MBC, with the pair defeating Rhino and confronting Stillwell, whom Gargan almost kills, before realizing that he'll never be normal again and leaving. Meanwhile, Venom finds a still-alive Sandman and blackmails him into working together to kill Spider-Man; otherwise, he will kill his daughter Penny. Sandman reluctantly agrees, and helps Venom kidnap Mary Jane to lure Spider-Man at a construction site, where the pair fight him. Seeing the news, Harry learns that his friends are in danger and goes to help them as New Goblin. He takes Mary Jane to safety and defeats Sandman, before being seemingly killed by Venom. Spider-Man and Venom then engage in a final fight, with Spider-Man gaining the upper hand using sonic vibration, leading to Venom getting impaled on some steel bars and dying.\n\nAfterwards, Peter mends his relationship with Mary Jane and Sandman, still alive, is reunited with Penny, who has been rescued by police. He thanks and apologizes to Spidey, before leaving with his daughter. The next day, Spider-Man resumes his neverending battle against crime, stating that the only way to honor and remember those he loves is by never giving up being Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/878901/ |title= Spider-Man 3 Wiki Guide - IGN |accessdate= 2019-07-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001071320/http://guides.ign.com/guides/878901/ |archive-date=2012-10-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/684224/ |title= Spider-Man 3 Wiki Guide - IGN |accessdate= 2019-07-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001071327/http://guides.ign.com/guides/684224/ |archive-date=2012-10-01 }}</ref>\n\n===PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable===\nAbout a year after the events of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|previous game]], Spider-Man stops a new gang, the H-Bombers, from blowing up the Carlyle building. The next day, Peter Parker narrates: \"Just another day in the life of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! Lately, things have been going my way. I got the girl, and New York finally likes me. Not that there aren't problems: There is this new guy [[Eddie Brock]] at the [[Daily Bugle]], and he is really starting to get on my nerves. [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], my best friend, won't talk to me. On top of that, new gangs have been dividing up the city. Still, it's nothing I can't handle. One weird thing, there hasn't been any big supervillain around since [[Doctor Octopus|Doc Ock]]. I have this bad feeling that the sky is gonna fall or something, and soon...\"\n\nSpider-Man tries balancing his superhero and civilian lives, including his job for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' and relationship with [[Mary Jane Watson]]. One day, after talking with his boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], about Spider-Man's role as the protector of New York, Spider-Man foils the H-Bombers' attempt to destroy some of the ''Daily Bugle''<nowiki/>'s assets. He then receives an assignment to photograph some lizard people spotted in Central Park, which he also defeats, saving some civilians they were trying to kidnap. That night, Peter takes Mary Jane on a thrill ride, stopping in Central Park to about Harry, who believes Peter murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. As they talk, an alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] inside a meteor crashes nearby and attaches itself to Peter's shoe, while Harry enters his father's secret [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] lair, donning his armor and gear and assuming the identity of \"New Goblin\". After taking Mary Jane home, Peter is attacked by New Goblin, who wants to avenge his father's death. Peter defeats him, knocking him unconscious, and brings him to a hospital to recover. Elsewhere, an escaped convict named [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] tries to escape from police and falls into a cockpit full of sand, where scientists are doing experiments on sand, one of which fuses Flint with the sand, turning him into Sandman.\n\nAfter a long day of fighting crime, Peter returns home and falls asleep, during which the symbiote envelops his body, leading to a brand newblack Spider-Man suit, which increases his powers, but also his aggresivity. After trying out the new suit in a fight against some gang members, he comes to conclude that it tires him very quickly and decides to use it only in emergency cases (although he is able to switch between it and the classic red and blue suit at any time). The following day, Spider-Man foils the H-Bombers' attack on the ''Daily Bugle'', saving a kidnapped Jameson and defeating their leader, revealed to be businessman [[Luke Carlyle]], thus ending the threat of the H-Bombers.\n\nLater that night, Spider-Man investigates the lab of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], his college science teacher, who has been reported missing for the past few days, and learns that he has been doing experiments on himself with a lizard DNA serum in the hopes of regrowing his right arm, only to transform into the Lizard. He is then attacked by the Lizard, but pursues him through the city and then the sewers. There, Spider-Man faces numerous other people infected by the Lizard, as well as hunters working for [[Kraven the Hunter]], who is hunting the Lizard. He eventually faces the Lizard and foils his plan to release the lizard people into the city, but he escapes deeper into the sewers. Spider-Man later tracks down both Kraven and the Lizard, defeating the former, before descovering that Connors, who was stabbed by Kraven and restored to normal, injected himself with a more powerful serum that turns him into a giant monster, dubbed \"Mega-Lizard\". Spider-Man defeats Mega-Lizard, restoring it back into Connors, but he does this in such a violent manner that he becomes concerned about the black suit. After Connors recovers, Spider-Man visits him to ask for his help in analyzing a piece of the symbiote suit, which he agrees to do, as Spider-Man saved his life.\n\nSpider-Man soon receives a new assignment from Jameson to photograph a [[vampire]] rumored to be attacking the people near [[Empire State University]]. He takes a photo of the vampire after he attacks him, and later defeats him, after unsuccessfully trying to analyze the symbiote on his own. Bringing the vampire to Connors' lab, Spider-Man learns from him that the vampire is [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Dr. Michael Morbius]], a worldwide renowned biochemist, before Morbius revealsthat his wife [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] was responsible for his transformation. Spider-Man confronts Shriek as she and her gang, the Waste Tribe, attempt to control the people of New York with an [[obelisk]], which he destroys, although Shriek escapes. After tracking her down to a warehouse, Spider-Man brings Morbius there. Shriek uses her powers to cure her husband, but then mind-controls him into attacking Spider-Man. He defeats Morbius, before learning that Shriek's power come from a symbiote similar to his, and uses the black suit to defeat Shriek. She then uses her last powers to cure Morbius of vampirism, at the expense of her being left in a coma. Spider-Man brings the unconscious Shriek to Connors' lab, where he and Morbius remain to look after her.\n\nThe next day, Peter and Eddie Brock are given the same assignment: expose Spider-Man as a menace, and the one who does it first gets a promotion. Brock attempts to cheat by posing as Spider-Man and committing crimes, but the real Spider-Man beats and exposes him, leading to him being fired and swearing revenge against both Spider-Man and Peter. Later, Peter decides to stop wearing the black suit for a while after overhearing two cops planning to issue a manhunt for him. Just then, he witnesses Sandman robbing an armored van and pursues him to the subway, defeating him using the black suit. However, the symbiote causes him to violently flush Sandman away, seemingly killing him.Later that night, after a horrible date with Mary Jane, where the symbiote makes Peter very aggressive, she decides to call off the relationship. Saddened, Spider-Man realizes the negative influence the symbiote has on his behavior and goes to a church, where he removes it using the bell's sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote attaches to Brock instead, who followed Peter and watched him unmask himself, turning him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\nVenom soon finds a still-alive Sandman and blackmails him into working together to kill Spider-Man; otherwise, he will kill his daughter Penny. Sandman reluctantly agrees, and helps Venom kidnap Mary Jane to lure Spider-Man at a construction site, where the pair fight him. Seeing the news, Harry learns that his friends are in danger and goes to help them as New Goblin. He takes Mary Jane to safety and defeats Sandman, before being seemingly killed by Venom. Spider-Man and Venom then engage in a final fight, with Spider-Man gaining the upper hand using sonic vibration, leading to Venom getting impaled on some steel bars and dying.\n\nAfterwards, Peter mends his relationship with Mary Jane and Sandman, still alive, is reunited with Penny, who has been rescued by police. He thanks and apologizes to Spidey, before leaving with his daughter. The next day, Spider-Man resumes his neverending battle against crime, stating that the only way to honor and remember those he loves is by never giving up being Spider-Man.\n\n===Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS===\nSet about a year after the events of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|previous game]], the game begins with Spider-Man web-swinging through the city, when he spots a building on fire. After enters the building and defusing a bomb that has been planted there, Spider-Man finds New Goblin flying around, and defeats him, knowing that it is his friend, [[Harry Osborn]]. Afterward, he retreats to save some civilians who are trapped in a building.\n\nAfter rescuing them, Spider-Man encounters [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and, knowing that he cannot defeat him, flees to his home, where the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] takes over his body. Spider-Man wakes up with the symbiote black suit on and decides to use it to his advantage, before learning of two new problems: [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] has kidnapped the Senator, and [[Luke Carlyle|The Mad Bomber]] has planted explosives throughout the city. After foiling their plans and defeating both of them, Spider-Man swings off to find Sandman and gives chase, eventually defeating him by violently opening a door that releases a large amount of water, which washes Sandman away, seemingly killing him.\n\nRealizing that the symbiote's influence is starting to corrupt his mind, Spider-Man tries to remove it and eventually succeeds, with the help of some sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote attaches to [[Eddie Brock]] instead, who desires revenge against both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, turning him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Spider-Man is later attacked by both Venom and Sandman, who is still alive and now has [[quicksand]] powers at his usage. After defeating Sandman, Spider-Man and Venom engage in a final battle, until Venom falls off the building and seemingly dies. Spider-Man proceeds to call for medical attention for Brock, as the symbiote slithers away and escapes into the night, ending the game with the final screenshot reading \"The End?\".\n\n==Special editions==\nSpecial editions of the game were available to PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 owners. The PlayStation 3 Collector's Edition artwork shows the fully colored Black Costume of Spider-Man instead of a combination of both suits. Common features for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 were an interview with [[Avi Arad]], chief creative officer of [[Marvel Entertainment]] and founder of [[Marvel Studios]], ''Spider-Man 3'' movie webisodes, a behind the scenes [[featurette]] with the cast, and a collectable lenticular card with the movie's images. The PlayStation 3 Collector's Edition came with a pre-installed DLC which featured the ability to play as the ''New Goblin'' (who's still only unlockable after you defeat him in the game.) The New Goblin DLC was later made available for download from [[Xbox Live]] and [[PlayStation Network]] users on July 12, 2007.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews \n|MC = (DS) 79/100<ref name=MCDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for DS|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(GBA) 68/100<ref name=MCGBA>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/spider-man-3|title=Spider-Man 3 for Game Boy Advance Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(X360) 63/100<ref name=MCX360>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for Xbox 360|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PC) 62/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for PC|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PS3) 60/100<ref name=MCPS3>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for PlayStation 3|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(Wii) 53/100<ref name=MCWII>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for Wii|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PSP) 52/100<ref name=MCPSP>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/spider-man-3|title=Spider-Man 3 for PSP Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PS2) 50/100<ref name=MCPS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for PlayStation 2|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>\n|Edge = 3/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Spider-Man 3 (X360)|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=July 2007|page=89}}</ref>\n|EGM = 6.33/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Spider-Man 3 (X360, PS3)|author=EGM Staff|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=217|date=July 2007|page=88}}</ref>\n|EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/spider-man-3-the-game-review|title=Spider-Man 3: The Game (X360)|last=Reed|first=Kristan|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2007-05-04|accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>\n|GI = 8/10<ref name=GI>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/CC2ACC55-E4B5-428E-88E4-8AAB35F65FBE.htm|title=Spider-Man 3 (PS3, X360)|last=Reiner|first=Andrew|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=171|date=July 2007|accessdate=2014-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730211130/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/CC2ACC55-E4B5-428E-88E4-8AAB35F65FBE.htm|archive-date=2009-07-30|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />(Wii) 6.5/10<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/924ABB78-A651-472A-AEF9-5BB72D617141.htm|title=Spider-Man 3 (Wii)|last=Reeves|first=Ben|magazine=Game Informer|issue=171|date=July 2007|accessdate=2014-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813214420/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/924ABB78-A651-472A-AEF9-5BB72D617141.htm|archive-date=2009-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|GamePro = 4.25/5<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox360/games/reviews/111811.shtml|title=Review: Spider-Man 3 (PS3, X360)|author=This Old Man|magazine=[[GamePro]]|date=2007-05-04|accessdate=2014-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508080431/http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox360/games/reviews/111811.shtml|archive-date=2007-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />(Wii) 3/5<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/111915.shtml|title=Review: Spider-Man 3 (Wii)|author=This Old Man|magazine=GamePro|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2014-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513060531/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/111915.shtml|archive-date=2007-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|GameRev = (Wii) C<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/wii/spider_man_3|title=Spider-Man 3 -

Some criticism has surfaced due to having New Goblin only fully playable in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was also criticized for having a lot of glitches.

A [[PlayStation Portable]] version was released on October 17, 2007. [[GameCube]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions were planned, but both were cancelled due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.\n\nThe game's plot expands on the film by including additional characters and elements from the [[Spider-Man]] comic books and the [[Marvel Universe]]. Depending on the platform, different villains from the comics are featured, but all versions of the game feature the film's three main antagonists: [[Harry Osborn|New Goblin]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Eddie Brock|Venom]].\n\n[[Tobey Maguire]], [[James Franco]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] reprised their roles from the film. [[Kirsten Dunst]], who portrayed [[Mary Jane Watson]] in the film, is replaced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. Some characters from the film do not appear in the game, namely [[Aunt May]], [[Gwen Stacy|Gwen]] and Captain [[George Stacy]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n===Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3===\n[[Image:Spider-man 3 360.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A shot of Spider-Man in his black suit, created by the alien symbiote.|alt=]]\n\nThe most conspicuous difference in these versions is where you cannot alternate between suits at will, similar to how the Prince cannot control his transformation into the Dark Prince in the Ubisoft title ''[[Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones]]''. Instead, you alternate between suits as you progress through the story. The upgrade system is different compared to earlier titles as well. Upgrades will be unlocked only as you progress and cannot be purchased. Collectables can be found in the form of tokens, which are scattered everywhere throughout the city, from skyscrapers to the subway tunnels. Once you have completed all the story missions, you are given a New Game + option. This will allow you to replay all the story missions in the black suit only. You can switch between suits via the pause menu. ''Spider-Man 3'' is the first Spider-Man title to introduce quick-time events, a mechanic where you have to follow the corresponding controls on-screen to progress. Like many other PC games, the PC version can be modified, although very few mods for this game have been produced. Scorpion, Rhino, and Kingpin are exclusive villains to this version.\n\nThe player is also granted temporary access to play as New Goblin during the final mission in the game in a boss fight against Sandman, until he became a full playable character exclusive to PlayStation 3's Collectors Edition of the game, then as downloadable content for both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. In the PC version's modifications, New Goblin's free roam gameplay is similar to his PlayStation Network/Xbox Live's downloadable content counterpart, such as having no story missions, except it has no challenge missions.\n\nOutside PC modifications, in all three versions, Peter Parker is also playable through a glitch, but some of your abilities are lost due to some of the glitch's bugs. However, you can overcome these bugs if you complete a certain side mission.\n\n===PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable===\nThe versions developed by Vicarious Visions differ from the versions developed by Treyarch. Most notably the recycled cutscenes and similar story missions, as well as the open-world hub and challenges. In the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, the black suit can be put on at will and works similar to Hypermode in ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', although there is a [[cooldown]] period after using it, instead of a health cost.  The black suit will enhance the player's attacks and health, but if the player uses it for too long, Spider-Man can be permanently corrupted by the black suit, leading to a non-standard [[game over]].  To free Spider-Man from the black suit, the player must perform a series of quick-time events to turn him back to normal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/spider-man-3-review-4?page=2|title=Spider-Man 3 (Wii) IGN review|last1=Casamassina|first1=Matt|website=IGN}}</ref>  Much like ''Spider-Man 2'', you have an upgrade system, where you can purchase unlocked upgrades as you progress. Upgrades are purchased with Hero Points. You earn these points by completing the main story missions, or the side missions. The black suit cannot be upgraded. Like other Spider-Man titles, there are side missions that can appear at random. These missions can range from muggings to delivering items such as fruit pies. The side missions however are activated through a radio transmission which gives you the option of doing the mentioned mission or not. This has never been done in any Spider-Man game before. Much like the next-gen versions, there is a crime wave mechanic, where on the overhead map displays the gangs throughout the city. To lower the crime wave, you must complete combat tours where you have to complete tasks similar to the side missions of the game. As you progress the combat tours the gangs will lose control, giving the NYPD an advantage. If however, you ignore the combat tours the gangs will take over more parts of the city as well as other gangs. This will affect the open-world hub with a new environmental mechanic. Similar to ''Spider-Man 2'' and ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', there are collectables. The only collectibles you can find, however, are the Meteorites and Spider Emblems. These are scattered throughout the city. Spider Emblems can only be found once you complete the story missions. Once you find them all you will unlock the black suit. The Combat System is much more similar to Ultimate Spider-Man than Spider-Man 2, such as lacking of mid-air combos from Spider-Man 2.\n\nThe primary features for the Wii version are motion controls. By flicking the Wii Remote & Nunchuck, the player can perform various actions such as combat, and one of Spider-Man's trademark abilities: Web Swinging. There are also certain mini-games tailored to the motion controls. This can range from disarming a bomb, to completing quick time events. The PlayStation Portable version is a full-on port of the PlayStation 2 version with an extra feature exclusive to the handheld known as \"Conquest Mode\". Conquest Mode is an extra mode where the player has only a very limited amount of time to traverse the city and complete challenges such as combat tours, delivering items, and protecting civilians. The more challenges are completed, the more \"hero points\" the player earns. Once time has elapsed, the score is calculated and the most recent save is loaded; the mission can be replayed any time to get a higher score. Conquest Mode can be exited with a visit to the Daily Bugle building in order to return to the main game. Conquest Mode can be accessed via the title screen or Scrapbook.\n\n===Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS===\nThe Game Boy Advance version is a [[side-scrolling]] action game. While the characters are seen [[2.5D]], everything else is 2D. It exacts the storyline of the film. A map is used to enter levels. (?) bubbles during levels give hints.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version and the Game Boy Advance version differ, but is side-scrolling and completely 2.5D. It uses the Touch Screen to execute most attacks.  In this version, players can put on the black suit at will, and it can only help them.  However, that suit will be disabled if Spider-Man's health is too low.  This version supports wireless multiplayer.\n\n==Plot==\n===Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3===\nAbout a year after the events of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|previous game]], Spider-Man stops a new gang, the H-Bombers, from blowing up the Carlyle building. The next day, Peter Parker narrates: \"Just another day in the life of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! Lately, things have been going my way. I got the girl, and New York finally likes me. Not that there aren't problems: There is this new guy [[Eddie Brock]] at the [[Daily Bugle]], and he is really starting to get on my nerves. [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], my best friend, won't talk to me. On top of that, new gangs have been dividing up the city. Still, it's nothing I can't handle. One weird thing, there hasn't been any big supervillain around since [[Doctor Octopus|Doc Ock]]. I have this bad feeling that the sky is gonna fall or something, and soon...\"\n\nBesides his job for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', where he recieves several assignments from his boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], such as having to photograph some lizard people spotted across the city, Spider-Man must face three new gangs terrorizing the city: the Apocalypse, Arsenic Candies, and Dragon Tails. He manages to foil their plans several times, and even defeats the Apocalypse's leader, while also dealing with the H-Bombers, who attempt to blow up the subway. After a long day of fighting crime, Spider-Man takes [[Mary Jane Watson]], his girlfriend, on a thrill ride, stopping in Central Park to about Harry, who believes Peter murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. As they talk, an alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] inside a meteor crashes nearby and attaches itself to Peter's shoe, while Harry enters his father's secret [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] lair, donning his armor and gear and assuming the identity of \"New Goblin\". At the same time, [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] makes experiments on himself with a lizard DNA serum, in the hopes of regrowing his right arm, only to transform into the Lizard. While investigating Connors' lab, Peter learns what happened, before being attacked by the Lizard. Pursuing him into the sewers, Spider-Man faces numerous other people infected by the Lizard, before finally facing him and foiling his plan to release the lizard people into the city, although the Lizard escapes deeper into the sewers. After returning to college, Peter is attacked by New Goblin, who wants to avenge his father's death. Peter defeats him, knocking him unconscious, and brings him to a hospital to recover. Elsewhere, an escaped convict named [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] tries to escape from police and falls into a cockpit full of sand, where scientists are doing experiments on sand, one of which fuses Flint with the sand, turning him into Sandman.\n\nThe following day, Spider-Man once again foils the H-Bombers' plans, learning that their leader is businessman [[Luke Carlyle]] in the process, and helps Detective [[Jean DeWolff|Jean DeWolfe]] investigate several arms deals and crooked cops in exchange for information on the H-Bombers. His conflict with the gang culminates with an attack on the ''Daily Bugle'', where Spider-Man saves a kidnapped Jameson and destroys the Bombers' helicopter, although Carlyle manages to escape. At the same time, Spider-Man investigates science corporation MechaBioCon (MBC) to learn about its connection with [[Mac Gargan|Mac Gargan/Scorpion]] (whom Spider-Man already encountered [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|three years prior]]), after witnessing him freeing [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] from a police van (whom Spider-Man also fought [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|one year ago]]). He soon learns that Gargan sought the help of head scientist [[Farley Stillwell|Dr. Stillwell]] to remove his armor, only for Stillwell to place him under her control and assign him to various illegal missions for MBC. Spider-Man eventually saves Scorpion, who gets mind-controlled into attacking him, but nontheless defeats him and destroys the mind-controlling device, freeing Gargan and earning his gratefulness.\n\nReturning home, Peter falls asleep, during which the symbiote envelops his body, leading to a brand new black Spider-Man suit, which increases his powers to new levels, but also his aggressivity. He then spots Sandman robbing a bank and pursues him to the subway, defeating him. However, the symbiote causes him to violently flush Sandman away, seemingly killing him. The next day, both Peter and Eddie Brock recieve the same assignment: catch Spider-Man robbing something, and the one who does it first gets a promotion. Brock attempts to cheat by paying someone to pose as Spider-Man, but the real Spider-Man arrives to foil his plan, punching Brock in the face, who then swears revenge against both Spider-Man and Peter.\n\nSpider-Man returns to the sewers in his search for the Lizard and fights [[Kraven the Hunter]], who is trying to hunt the Lizard. As Spider-Man defeats Kraven, who escapes, his partner [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]] uses her magic to transform the Lizard into a giant monster, dubbed \"Mega-Lizard\". Spider-Man defeats Mega-Lizard, restoring it back into Connors, but he does this in such a violent manner that he becomes concerned about the black suit. Later, Spider-Man foils both the Arsenic Candies and Dragon Tails' plans, while also defeating their respective leaders. He then recieves an assignment to take photos of the police's speech about the gangs' defeat at the courthouse, only to witness [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] releasing the three gang leaders and making off with them, in order to unite the gangs in an attempt to kill Spider-Man. That evening, Spider-Man goes to face Kingpin at his lair, defeating both him and the gang leaders. However, the symbiote makes him very aggressive once again and he throws Kingpin off a window, seemingly killing him.\n\nLater that night, after a horrible date with Mary Jane, where the symbiote makes Peter very aggressive, she decides to call off the relationship. Saddened, Spider-Man realizes the negative influence the symbiote has on his behavior and goes to a church, where he removes it using the bell's sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote attaches to Brock instead, who followed Peter and watched him unmask himself, turning him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\nBack to his senses, Spider-Man helps both a recovered Connors restore all the remaining lizard people back to normal, and Scorpion to exact revenge on MBC, with the pair defeating Rhino and confronting Stillwell, whom Gargan almost kills, before realizing that he'll never be normal again and leaving. Meanwhile, Venom finds a still-alive Sandman and blackmails him into working together to kill Spider-Man; otherwise, he will kill his daughter Penny. Sandman reluctantly agrees, and helps Venom kidnap Mary Jane to lure Spider-Man at a construction site, where the pair fight him. Seeing the news, Harry learns that his friends are in danger and goes to help them as New Goblin. He takes Mary Jane to safety and defeats Sandman, before being seemingly killed by Venom. Spider-Man and Venom then engage in a final fight, with Spider-Man gaining the upper hand using sonic vibration, leading to Venom getting impaled on some steel bars and dying.\n\nAfterwards, Peter mends his relationship with Mary Jane and Sandman, still alive, is reunited with Penny, who has been rescued by police. He thanks and apologizes to Spidey, before leaving with his daughter. The next day, Spider-Man resumes his neverending battle against crime, stating that the only way to honor and remember those he loves is by never giving up being Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/878901/ |title= Spider-Man 3 Wiki Guide - IGN |accessdate= 2019-07-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001071320/http://guides.ign.com/guides/878901/ |archive-date=2012-10-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/684224/ |title= Spider-Man 3 Wiki Guide - IGN |accessdate= 2019-07-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001071327/http://guides.ign.com/guides/684224/ |archive-date=2012-10-01 }}</ref>\n\n===PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable===\nAbout a year after the events of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|previous game]], Spider-Man stops a new gang, the H-Bombers, from blowing up the Carlyle building.

After taking Mary Jane home, Peter is attacked by New Goblin, who wants to avenge his father's death. Peter defeats him, knocking him unconscious, and brings him to a hospital to recover. Elsewhere, an escaped convict named [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] tries to escape from police and falls into a cockpit full of sand, where scientists are doing experiments on sand, one of which fuses Flint with the sand, turning him into Sandman.\n\nAfter a long day of fighting crime, Peter returns home and falls asleep, during which the symbiote envelops his body, leading to a brand newblack Spider-Man suit, which increases his powers, but also his aggresivity. After trying out the new suit in a fight against some gang members, he comes to conclude that it tires him very quickly and decides to use it only in emergency cases (although he is able to switch between it and the classic red and blue suit at any time). The following day, Spider-Man foils the H-Bombers' attack on the ''Daily Bugle'', saving a kidnapped Jameson and defeating their leader, revealed to be businessman [[Luke Carlyle]], thus ending the threat of the H-Bombers.\n\nLater that night, Spider-Man investigates the lab of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], his college science teacher, who has been reported missing for the past few days, and learns that he has been doing experiments on himself with a lizard DNA serum in the hopes of regrowing his right arm, only to transform into the Lizard. He is then attacked by the Lizard, but pursues him through the city and then the sewers. There, Spider-Man faces numerous other people infected by the Lizard, as well as hunters working for [[Kraven the Hunter]], who is hunting the Lizard. He eventually faces the Lizard and foils his plan to release the lizard people into the city, but he escapes deeper into the sewers. Spider-Man later tracks down both Kraven and the Lizard, defeating the former, before descovering that Connors, who was stabbed by Kraven and restored to normal, injected himself with a more powerful serum that turns him into a giant monster, dubbed \"Mega-Lizard\". Spider-Man defeats Mega-Lizard, restoring it back into Connors, but he does this in such a violent manner that he becomes concerned about the black suit. After Connors recovers, Spider-Man visits him to ask for his help in analyzing a piece of the symbiote suit, which he agrees to do, as Spider-Man saved his life.\n\nSpider-Man soon recieves a new assigment from Jameson to photograph a [[vampire]] rumored to be attacking the people near [[Empire State University]]. He takes a photo of the vampire after he attacks him, and later defeats him, after unsuccesfully trying to analyze the symbiote on his own. Bringing the vampire to Connors' lab, Spider-Man learns from him that the vampire is [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Dr. Michael Morbius]], a worldwide renowned biochemist, before Morbius revealsthat his wife [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] was responsible for his transformation. Spider-Man confronts Shriek as she and her gang, the Waste Tribe, attempt to control the people of New York with an [[obelisk]], which he destroys, although Shriek escapes. After tracking her down to a warehouse, Spider-Man brings Morbius there. Shriek uses her powers to cure her husband, but then mind-controls him into attacking Spider-Man. He defeats Morbius, before learning that Shriek's power come from a symbiote similar to his, and uses the black suit to defeat Shriek. She then uses her last powers to cure Morbius of vampirism, at the expense of her being left in a coma. Spider-Man brings the unconscious Shriek to Connors' lab, where he and Morbius remain to look after her.\n\nThe next day, Peter and Eddie Brock are given the same assignment: expose Spider-Man as a menace, and the one who does it first gets a promotion. Brock attempts to cheat by posing as Spider-Man and committing crimes, but the real Spider-Man beats and exposes him, leading to him being fired and swearing revenge against both Spider-Man and Peter. Later, Peter decides to stop wearing the black suit for a while after overhearing two cops planning to issue a manhunt for him. Just then, he witnesses Sandman robbing an armored van and pursues him to the subway, defeating him using the black suit. However, the symbiote causes him to violently flush Sandman away, seemingly killing him.Later that night, after a horrible date with Mary Jane, where the symbiote makes Peter very aggressive, she decides to call off the relationship. Saddened, Spider-Man realizes the negative influence the symbiote has on his behavior and goes to a church, where he removes it using the bell's sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote attaches to Brock instead, who followed Peter and watched him unmask himself, turning him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\nVenom soon finds a still-alive Sandman and blackmails him into working together to kill Spider-Man; otherwise, he will kill his daughter Penny. Sandman reluctantly agrees, and helps Venom kidnap Mary Jane to lure Spider-Man at a construction site, where the pair fight him. Seeing the news, Harry learns that his friends are in danger and goes to help them as New Goblin. He takes Mary Jane to safety and defeats Sandman, before being seemingly killed by Venom. Spider-Man and Venom then engage in a final fight, with Spider-Man gaining the upper hand using sonic vibration, leading to Venom getting impaled on some steel bars and dying.\n\nAfterwards, Peter mends his relationship with Mary Jane and Sandman, still alive, is reunited with Penny, who has been rescued by police. He thanks and apologizes to Spidey, before leaving with his daughter. The next day, Spider-Man resumes his neverending battle against crime, stating that the only way to honor and remember those he loves is by never giving up being Spider-Man.\n\n===Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS===\nSet about a year after the events of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|previous game]], the game begins with Spider-Man web-swinging through the city, when he spots a building on fire. After enters the building and defusing a bomb that has been planted there, Spider-Man finds New Goblin flying around, and defeats him, knowing that it is his friend, [[Harry Osborn]]. Afterward, he retreats to save some civilians who are trapped in a building.\n\nAfter rescuing them, Spider-Man encounters [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and, knowing that he cannot defeat him, flees to his home, where the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] takes over his body. Spider-Man wakes up with the symbiote black suit on and decides to use it to his advantage, before learning of two new problems: [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] has kidnapped the Senator, and [[Luke Carlyle|The Mad Bomber]] has planted explosives throughout the city. After foiling their plans and defeating both of them, Spider-Man swings off to find Sandman and gives chase, eventually defeating him by violently opening a door that releases a large amount of water, which washes Sandman away, seemingly killing him.\n\nRealizing that the symbiote's influence is starting to corrupt his mind, Spider-Man tries to remove it and eventually succeeds, with the help of some sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote attaches to [[Eddie Brock]] instead, who desires revenge against both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, turning him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Spider-Man is later attacked by both Venom and Sandman, who is still alive and now has [[quicksand]] powers at his usage. After defeating Sandman, Spider-Man and Venom engage in a final battle, until Venom falls off the building and seemingly dies. Spider-Man proceeds to call for medical attention for Brock, as the symbiote slithers away and escapes into the night, ending the game with the final screenshot reading \"The End?\".\n\n==Special editions==\nSpecial editions of the game were available to PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 owners. The PlayStation 3 Collector's Edition artwork shows the fully colored Black Costume of Spider-Man instead of a combination of both suits. Common features for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 were an interview with [[Avi Arad]], chief creative officer of [[Marvel Entertainment]] and founder of [[Marvel Studios]], ''Spider-Man 3'' movie webisodes, a behind the scenes [[featurette]] with the cast, and a collectable lenticular card with the movie's images. The PlayStation 3 Collector's Edition came with a pre-installed DLC which featured the ability to play as the ''New Goblin'' (who's still only unlockable after you defeat him in the game.) The New Goblin DLC was later made available for download from [[Xbox Live]] and [[PlayStation Network]] users on July 12, 2007.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews \n|MC = (DS) 79/100<ref name=MCDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for DS|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(GBA) 68/100<ref name=MCGBA>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/spider-man-3|title=Spider-Man 3 for Game Boy Advance Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(X360) 63/100<ref name=MCX360>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for Xbox 360|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PC) 62/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for PC|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PS3) 60/100<ref name=MCPS3>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for PlayStation 3|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(Wii) 53/100<ref name=MCWII>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for Wii|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PSP) 52/100<ref name=MCPSP>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/spider-man-3|title=Spider-Man 3 for PSP Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><br />(PS2) 50/100<ref name=MCPS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/spider-man-3/critic-reviews|title=Spider-Man 3 Critic Reviews for PlayStation 2|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>\n|Edge = 3/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Spider-Man 3 (X360)|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=July 2007|page=89}}</ref>\n|EGM = 6.33/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Spider-Man 3 (X360, PS3)|author=EGM Staff|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=217|date=July 2007|page=88}}</ref>\n|EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/spider-man-3-the-game-review|title=Spider-Man 3: The Game (X360)|last=Reed|first=Kristan|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2007-05-04|accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>\n|GI = 8/10<ref name=GI>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/CC2ACC55-E4B5-428E-88E4-8AAB35F65FBE.htm|title=Spider-Man 3 (PS3, X360)|last=Reiner|first=Andrew|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=171|date=July 2007|accessdate=2014-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730211130/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/CC2ACC55-E4B5-428E-88E4-8AAB35F65FBE.htm|archive-date=2009-07-30|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />(Wii) 6.5/10<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/924ABB78-A651-472A-AEF9-5BB72D617141.htm|title=Spider-Man 3 (Wii)|last=Reeves|first=Ben|magazine=Game Informer|issue=171|date=July 2007|accessdate=2014-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813214420/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/924ABB78-A651-472A-AEF9-5BB72D617141.htm|archive-date=2009-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|GamePro = 4.25/5<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox360/games/reviews/111811.shtml|title=Review: Spider-Man 3 (PS3, X360)|author=This Old Man|magazine=[[GamePro]]|date=2007-05-04|accessdate=2014-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508080431/http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox360/games/reviews/111811.shtml|archive-date=2007-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />(Wii) 3/5<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/111915.shtml|title=Review: Spider-Man 3 (Wii)|author=This Old Man|magazine=GamePro|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2014-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513060531/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/111915.shtml|archive-date=2007-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|GameRev = (Wii) C<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/wii/spider_man_3|title=Spider-Man 3 -

It implies seniority over all other [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretaries of State]] in terms of [[Cabinet rank]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/george-osborne-made-first-secretary-of-state-in-cabinet-reshuffle |title=George Osborne made first secretary of state in cabinet reshuffle|date=8 May 2015 |author=Nicholas Watt|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=8 May 2015 }}</ref> but has no specific powers or authority attached to it beyond that of any other Secretary of State. When no [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] is in office, the post is ''[[de facto]]'' second in Government. If there is no First Secretary of State, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] is typically ''de facto'' second in Government, although under [[Theresa May]], [[David Lidington]] as [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] held a higher [[Cabinet rank]] than [[Chancellor]] [[Philip Hammond]].\n\nThe title is not always in use, so there have sometimes been extended gaps between successive holders of the title. It was unused the longest in the 25 years between 1970 and 1995. After [[Damian Green]] resigned over sexual harassment allegations on 20 December 2017, no Secretary of State was appointed to fill the post until Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] appointed [[Dominic Raab]] on 24 July 2019 when he became Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42434802|work=BBC News |title=Damian Green sacked after 'misleading statements' on porn claims|date=21 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/20/breaking-theresa-mays-effective-deputy-damian-green-quits-pornography/|newspaper=The Telegraph |title=Damian Green sacked over porn cover-up as Theresa May suffers third Cabinet departure in two months }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dominic Raab appointed UK foreign secretary, first secretary of state: statement |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-leader-raab/dominic-raab-appointed-uk-foreign-secretary-first-secretary-of-state-statement-idUSKCN1UJ2JF |work=Reuters |location=London |date=25 July 2019 |access-date=26 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Responsibilities ==\nThe role has had varying responsibilities over time. The most recent responsibilities are:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/first-secretary-of-state|title=First Secretary of State - GOV.UK |website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n* Supporting the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the running of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]].\n* Deputising for the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].\n* Advising the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] on developing and implementing Government policy.\n* Driving forward government business and implementation including through chairing and deputy chairing cabinet committees and taskforces.\n* Overseeing constitutional affairs and maintaining the integrity of the Union.\n* Oversight of all [[Cabinet Office]] policies.\n*Answering the questions at [[Prime Minister's Questions|PMQs]] in absence of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].\n\n==Relationship with Deputy Prime Minister==\nThe post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] had been created in 1942 for [[Clement Attlee]], the leader of the Labour Party in [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition ministry]]. The post indicated that the holder ranked second in government, after the Prime Minister, but did not confer cabinet rank and did not pay a salary. For this reason, the Deputy Prime Minister concurrently held other offices, entitling him to a place in cabinet.\n\nThe title ''First Secretary of State'' indicated the holder's rank as a Secretary of State, with a place in cabinet. The title was created in 1962 for Deputy Prime Minister [[Rab Butler|R. A. Butler]], granting him a place in cabinet despite not holding a specific cabinet portfolio. [[Michael Heseltine]] and [[John Prescott]] were also relieved of their cabinet portfolios when serving as Deputy Prime Minister, and were therefore additionally appointed First Secretary of State. In 1964, Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] established the alternative usage, appointing a First Secretary of State among the cabinet without appointing a Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nThe two titles have only existed concurrently with different holders in one government: in [[David Cameron]]'s [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition ministry of 2010\u201315]], [[Nick Clegg]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, while former Conservative leader [[William Hague]] was appointed First Secretary of State.\n\n== List of First Secretaries of State ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:Center; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|+First Secretary of State\n!colspan=2 |Portrait\n!Name<br />{{small|(Birth\u2013Death)}}\n!colspan=2 |Term of office\n!style=\"font-size:90%\" |Other ministerial offices\n!Party\n!Ministry\n!<abbr title=\"Reference\">Ref.</abbr>\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[File:Rab Butler.png|75px]]\n|[[Rab Butler|'''R.

When no [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] is in office, the post is ''[[de facto]]'' second in Government. If there is no First Secretary of State, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] is typically ''de facto'' second in Government, although under [[Theresa May]], [[David Lidington]] as [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] held a higher [[Cabinet rank]] than [[Chancellor]] [[Philip Hammond]].\n\nThe title is not always in use, so there have sometimes been extended gaps between successive holders of the title. It was unused the longest in the 25 years between 1970 and 1995. After [[Damian Green]] resigned over sexual harassment allegations on 20 December 2017, no Secretary of State was appointed to fill the post until Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] appointed [[Dominic Raab]] on 24 July 2019 when he became Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42434802|work=BBC News |title=Damian Green sacked after 'misleading statements' on porn claims|date=21 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/20/breaking-theresa-mays-effective-deputy-damian-green-quits-pornography/|newspaper=The Telegraph |title=Damian Green sacked over porn cover-up as Theresa May suffers third Cabinet departure in two months }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dominic Raab appointed UK foreign secretary, first secretary of state: statement |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-leader-raab/dominic-raab-appointed-uk-foreign-secretary-first-secretary-of-state-statement-idUSKCN1UJ2JF |work=Reuters |location=London |date=25 July 2019 |access-date=26 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Responsibilities ==\nThe role has had varying responsibilities over time.

The post indicated that the holder ranked second in government, after the Prime Minister, but did not confer cabinet rank and did not pay a salary. For this reason, the Deputy Prime Minister concurrently held other offices, entitling him to a place in cabinet.\n\nThe title ''First Secretary of State'' indicated the holder's rank as a Secretary of State, with a place in cabinet. The title was created in 1962 for Deputy Prime Minister [[Rab Butler|R. A. Butler]], granting him a place in cabinet despite not holding a specific cabinet portfolio. [[Michael Heseltine]] and [[John Prescott]] were also relieved of their cabinet portfolios when serving as Deputy Prime Minister, and were therefore additionally appointed First Secretary of State. In 1964, Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] established the alternative usage, appointing a First Secretary of State among the cabinet without appointing a Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nThe two titles have only existed concurrently with different holders in one government: in [[David Cameron]]'s [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition ministry of 2010\u201315]], [[Nick Clegg]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, while former Conservative leader [[William Hague]] was appointed First Secretary of State.\n\n== List of First Secretaries of State ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:Center; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|+First Secretary of State\n!colspan=2 |Portrait\n!Name<br />{{small|(Birth\u2013Death)}}\n!colspan=2 |Term of office\n!style=\"font-size:90%\" |Other ministerial offices\n!Party\n!Ministry\n!<abbr title=\"Reference\">Ref.</abbr>\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[File:Rab Butler.png|75px]]\n|[[Rab Butler|'''R.
