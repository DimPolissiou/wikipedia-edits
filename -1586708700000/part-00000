He described the movement as follows:<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Driscoll|2006|p=22}}. ''Cited in''\n{{Cite journal|title = Perspicuity of Scripture: The Emergent Approach|journal = [[Master's Seminary|Master's Seminary Journal]]|volume = 17|issue = 2|last = MacArthur|first = John F.|authorlink = John F. MacArthur|year = 2006|url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj17g.pdf|issn = 1066-3959|pages = 12\u201313|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624213346/http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj17g.pdf|archivedate = June 24, 2010|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The emerging church is a growing, loosely connected movement of primarily young pastors who are glad to see the end of modernity and are seeking to function as missionaries who bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to emerging and postmodern cultures. The emerging church welcomes the tension of holding in one closed hand the unchanging truth of evangelical Christian theology ({{bibleref2|Jude 3}}) and holding in one open hand the many cultural ways of showing and speaking Christian truth as a missionary to America ({{bibleref2|1 Cor|9:19\u201323}}). Since the movement, if it can be called that, is young and is still defining its theological center, I do not want to portray the movement as ideologically unified because I myself swim in the theologically conservative stream of the emerging church.</blockquote>\n\nDriscoll later distanced himself from the movement:<ref>{{cite web | last = Driscoll | first = Mark | title = Welcome | url = http://theresurgence.com/?q=node/5 | accessdate = July 11, 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085722/http://theresurgence.com/?q=node%2F5 | archivedate = May 24, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the [[emerging church]] and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like [[Brian McLaren]] and [[Doug Pagitt]] began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to [[Gender of God in Christianity|God as a chick]], questioning [[Attributes of God in Christianity#Sovereignty|God's sovereignty]] over and [[open theism|knowledge of the future]], denial of the [[substitutionary atonement]] at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of [[hell]] which is one hell of a mistake.</blockquote>\n\n=== Gender roles ===\n\nOn gender roles, Driscoll is a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]], believing that men and women have equal worth, but have different roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church.<ref name=\":5\" /> According to a ''Mother Jones'' profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held [[Christian egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views at one time. He offered church courses in \"evangelical feminism\" and is quoted as saying \"the Bible is clear that men and women are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way.\"<ref name=\"MoJo-1998\" /> In 2003, Driscoll said that he wished he could change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMale leadership of the church is crucial, according to Driscoll, who believes that God called him specifically to \"train men.\" He traces many modern spiritual and social problems to the acceptance of female leadership. Driscoll describes Eve's temptation by the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] as \"the first invitation to an independent feminism.\" For Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was, according to Driscoll, \"the first exercising of a woman's role in leadership in the home and in the church in the history of the world. It does not go well.\"<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nDriscoll believes that Christianity has been \"feminized\". In a 2006 interview with ''Desiring God'', he said, \"The problem with the church today, it's just a bunch of nice, soft, tender, 'chickified' [''sic''] church boys. Sixty percent of Christians are chicks, and the forty percent that are dudes are still sort of chicks.&nbsp;... The whole architecture and the whole aesthetic [of church buildings and services] is really feminine.\"<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite video| people = Mark Driscoll (interviewee), Josh Brage (contributor)| title = Church Needs Dudes| accessdate = May 5, 2005| date = April 14, 2006 | time = 120 seconds| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lex6orNNzTs}}</ref> In contrast, Driscoll emphasizes what he perceives as macho behavior in the actions of biblical protagonists: he describes [[Jesus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], and [[David|King David]] saying: \"... these guys were dudes. Heterosexual, win-a-fight, punch-you-in-the-nose, dudes.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> He believes that in order to be innovative, the church needs to get entrepreneurial young men involved, who will \"make the culture of the future.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nDriscoll interprets the Apostle Paul as writing that women are encouraged to be an active part of life and ministry in the church, but that only men can teach other men or become \"[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]-pastors\" (the terms being synonymous). Since Paul's prohibition of female elder-pastors appeals to the Genesis creation story ({{bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:14}}) for its rationale, Driscoll argues that the restriction is permanent and cannot be adjusted for changing culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|title = FAQ: Women and Ministry|date = September 20, 2011|accessdate = August 1, 2014|website = pastormark.tv|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140806213738/http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|archivedate = August 6, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] elected [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as its first female [[Presiding Bishop]], Driscoll wrote on his blog that \"if Christian males do not man up soon, the Episcopalians may vote a fluffy baby bunny rabbit as their next bishop to lead God's men.\"<ref>{{Cite web| last = Connelly| first = Joel| title = New bishop brings wit to the job| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = September 4, 2007| accessdate = May 5, 2014| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/connelly/article/New-bishop-brings-wit-to-the-job-1248678.php#src=fb}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAccording to Salon.com, \"Driscoll has been a key advocate for candid conversations about sexuality among conservative Christians\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nIn ''Christians Might Be Crazy'', Driscoll defends marriage as being between a man and a woman saying \"It is clear that Jesus saw the male-female marriage bond of Genesis 1-2 as the prototype for human sexual relationships. Anything outside those boundaries was off limits. Despite this strong evidence, supporters of homosexuality nevertheless often appeal to Jesus, claiming that 'Jesus never condemned homosexuality' or even 'He never mentioned homosexuality'. [...] Jesus was no coward when it came to speaking up in order to rattle conventional thinking and effect change.

He described the movement as follows:<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Driscoll|2006|p=22}}. ''Cited in''\n{{Cite journal|title = Perspicuity of Scripture: The Emergent Approach|journal = [[Master's Seminary|Master's Seminary Journal]]|volume = 17|issue = 2|last = MacArthur|first = John F.|authorlink = John F.

The emerging church welcomes the tension of holding in one closed hand the unchanging truth of evangelical Christian theology ({{bibleref2|Jude 3}}) and holding in one open hand the many cultural ways of showing and speaking Christian truth as a missionary to America ({{bibleref2|1 Cor|9:19\u201323}}). Since the movement, if it can be called that, is young and is still defining its theological center, I do not want to portray the movement as ideologically unified because I myself swim in the theologically conservative stream of the emerging church.</blockquote>\n\nDriscoll later distanced himself from the movement:<ref>{{cite web | last = Driscoll | first = Mark | title = Welcome | url = http://theresurgence.com/?q=node/5 | accessdate = July 11, 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085722/http://theresurgence.com/?q=node%2F5 | archivedate = May 24, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the [[emerging church]] and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like [[Brian McLaren]] and [[Doug Pagitt]] began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to [[Gender of God in Christianity|God as a chick]], questioning [[Attributes of God in Christianity#Sovereignty|God's sovereignty]] over and [[open theism|knowledge of the future]], denial of the [[substitutionary atonement]] at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of [[hell]] which is one hell of a mistake.</blockquote>\n\n=== Gender roles ===\n\nOn gender roles, Driscoll is a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]], believing that men and women have equal worth, but have different roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church.<ref name=\":5\" /> According to a ''Mother Jones'' profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held [[Christian egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views at one time. He offered church courses in \"evangelical feminism\" and is quoted as saying \"the Bible is clear that men and women are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way.\"<ref name=\"MoJo-1998\" /> In 2003, Driscoll said that he wished he could change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMale leadership of the church is crucial, according to Driscoll, who believes that God called him specifically to \"train men.\" He traces many modern spiritual and social problems to the acceptance of female leadership. Driscoll describes Eve's temptation by the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] as \"the first invitation to an independent feminism.\" For Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was, according to Driscoll, \"the first exercising of a woman's role in leadership in the home and in the church in the history of the world. It does not go well.\"<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nDriscoll believes that Christianity has been \"feminized\". In a 2006 interview with ''Desiring God'', he said, \"The problem with the church today, it's just a bunch of nice, soft, tender, 'chickified' [''sic''] church boys. Sixty percent of Christians are chicks, and the forty percent that are dudes are still sort of chicks.&nbsp;... The whole architecture and the whole aesthetic [of church buildings and services] is really feminine.\"<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite video| people = Mark Driscoll (interviewee), Josh Brage (contributor)| title = Church Needs Dudes| accessdate = May 5, 2005| date = April 14, 2006 | time = 120 seconds| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lex6orNNzTs}}</ref> In contrast, Driscoll emphasizes what he perceives as macho behavior in the actions of biblical protagonists: he describes [[Jesus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], and [[David|King David]] saying: \"... these guys were dudes. Heterosexual, win-a-fight, punch-you-in-the-nose, dudes.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> He believes that in order to be innovative, the church needs to get entrepreneurial young men involved, who will \"make the culture of the future.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nDriscoll interprets the Apostle Paul as writing that women are encouraged to be an active part of life and ministry in the church, but that only men can teach other men or become \"[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]-pastors\" (the terms being synonymous). Since Paul's prohibition of female elder-pastors appeals to the Genesis creation story ({{bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:14}}) for its rationale, Driscoll argues that the restriction is permanent and cannot be adjusted for changing culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|title = FAQ: Women and Ministry|date = September 20, 2011|accessdate = August 1, 2014|website = pastormark.tv|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140806213738/http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|archivedate = August 6, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] elected [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as its first female [[Presiding Bishop]], Driscoll wrote on his blog that \"if Christian males do not man up soon, the Episcopalians may vote a fluffy baby bunny rabbit as their next bishop to lead God's men.\"<ref>{{Cite web| last = Connelly| first = Joel| title = New bishop brings wit to the job| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = September 4, 2007| accessdate = May 5, 2014| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/connelly/article/New-bishop-brings-wit-to-the-job-1248678.php#src=fb}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAccording to Salon.com, \"Driscoll has been a key advocate for candid conversations about sexuality among conservative Christians\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nIn ''Christians Might Be Crazy'', Driscoll defends marriage as being between a man and a woman saying \"It is clear that Jesus saw the male-female marriage bond of Genesis 1-2 as the prototype for human sexual relationships. Anything outside those boundaries was off limits. Despite this strong evidence, supporters of homosexuality nevertheless often appeal to Jesus, claiming that 'Jesus never condemned homosexuality' or even 'He never mentioned homosexuality'.

It occurs when the instantaneous [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]] (that is, the [[derivative]]) of a quantity with respect to time is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the quantity itself. Described as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], a quantity undergoing exponential growth is an [[exponential function]] of time, that is, the variable representing time is the exponent (in contrast to other types of growth, such as [[quadratic growth]]). \n\nIf the constant of proportionality is negative, then the quantity decreases over time, and is said to be undergoing [[exponential decay]] instead. In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''' since the function values form a [[geometric progression]].\n\nThe formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;...), is\n\n:<math>x_t = x_0(1+r)^t</math>\n\nwhere ''x''<sub>0</sub> is the value of ''x'' at time 0. The growth of a [[bacteria]]l [[Colony (biology)|colony]] is often used to illustrate it. One bacterium splits itself into two, each of which splits itself resulting in four, then eight, 16, 32, and so on. The rate of increase keeps increasing because it is proportional to the ever-increasing number of bacteria. Growth like this is observed in real-life activity or phenomena, such as the spread of virus infection, the growth of debt due to [[compound interest]], and the spread of [[viral video]]s. In real cases, initial exponential growth often do not last forever, slowing down due to upper limits caused by external factors and turning into the [[logistic curve|logistic growth]].\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:e.coli-colony-growth.gif|right|frame|150px|[[Bacteria]] exhibit exponential growth under optimal conditions.]]\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\n===Biology===\n* The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism and gene expression.<ref name=\"SlavovBudnik2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705\u2013714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}</ref>    \n* A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.\n\n===Physics===\n* [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.\n* [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. \"Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3\u20134 generations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>\n* [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequency|component frequencies]] of the signal over others.\n\n===Economics===\n* [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.\n\n===Finance===\n* [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital.{{sfn|Crauder|Evans|Noell|2008|pp=314\u2013315}} See also [[rule of 72]].\n* [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.\n\n===Computer science===\n* [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)\n* In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2<sup>''x''</sup>, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.\n=== Internet phenomena ===\n* Internet contents, such as [[internet meme]]s or [[viral video|video]]s, can spread in an exponential manner, often said to \"[[viral phenomenon|go viral]]\" as an analogy to the spread of viruses.<ref name=aca>{{cite web|title=To Go Viral|author=Ariel Cintr\u00f3n-Arias|date=2014|arxiv=1402.3499}}</ref> With media such as [[social networks]], one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously, who then spread it to even more people, and so on, causing rapid spread.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|author1=Karine Nahon|author2=Jeff Hemsley|title=Going Viral|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hjdh8fID3nUC&pg=PA16|date=2013|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-7129-1|p=16}}</ref>  For example, the video [[Gangnam Style]] was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 15 July 2012, reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers on the first day, millions on the twentieth day, and was cumulatively viewed by hundreds of millions in less than two months.<ref name=aca/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube-trends.blogspot.com/2012/09/gangnam-style-vs-call-me-maybe.html|title=Gangnam Style vs Call Me Maybe: A Popularity Comparison|work=YouTube Trends|author=YouTube|date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Basic formula==\nA quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if\n\n:<math>x(t)=a\\cdot b^{t/\\tau}</math>\n\nwhere the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',\n\n:<math>x(0)=a\\, ,</math>\n\nthe constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''\u03c4'' is the [[time constant]]\u2014the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':\n\n:<math>x(t+\\tau)=a \\cdot b^{\\frac{t+\\tau}{\\tau}} = a \\cdot b^{\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\cdot b^{\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau}} = x(t)\\cdot b\\, .</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''\u03c4'' > 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' > 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''\u03c4'' < 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' > 1}}, or {{nowrap|''\u03c4'' > 0}}  and 0 < {{nowrap|''b'' < 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].\n\nExample: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and ''\u03c4''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;min.\n\n:<math>x(t)=a\\cdot b^{t/\\tau}=1\\cdot 2^{(60\\text{ min})/(10\\text{ min})}</math>\n\n:<math>x(1\\text{ hr})= 1 \\cdot 2^6 =64.</math>\n\nAfter one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.\n\nMany pairs (''b'',&nbsp;''\u03c4'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''\u03c4'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''\u03c4'' proportional to log&nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''\u03c4''. For any non-zero time ''\u03c4'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&nbsp;''b''.\n\nThus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:\n\n:<math>x(t) = x_0\\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\\cdot e^{t/\\tau} = x_0 \\cdot 2^{t/T}\n= x_0\\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^{t/p},</math>\n\nwhere ''x''<sub>0</sub> expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).\n\nParameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):\n* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].\n* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''\u03c4'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.\n* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.\n* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.\nThe quantities ''k'', ''\u03c4'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):\n\n:<math>k = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T} = \\frac{\\ln \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)}{p}</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''\u03c4'' and ''T'' being infinite.\n\nIf ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.\n\nA popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],\nthat is, <math>T \\simeq 70 / r</math>.\n\n{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations.

For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.\n\n==Differential equation==\nThe [[exponential function]] <math>x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}</math> satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\!\\, \\frac{dx}{dt} = kx</math>\n\nsaying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]\n:<math>x(0).</math>\n\nThe differential equation is solved by direct integration:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} & = kx \\\\[5pt]\n\\frac{dx} x & = k\\, dt \\\\[5pt]\n\\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \\frac{dx}{x} & = k \\int_0^t  \\, dt \\\\[5pt]\n\\ln \\frac{x(t)}{x(0)} & =  kt.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nso that\n\n: <math> x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}</math>\n\nIn the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' < 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].\n\nFor a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].\n\n==Difference equation==\nThe [[difference equation]]\n\n:<math>x_t = a \\cdot x_{t-1}</math>\n\nhas solution\n\n:<math>x_t = x_0 \\cdot a^t,</math>\n\nshowing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.\n\n== Other growth rates ==\nIn the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, that is, for all \u03b1:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty} {t^\\alpha \\over ae^t} =0.</math>\n\nThere is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See {{sectionlink|Degree of a polynomial|Computed from the function values}}.\n\nGrowth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and <math>A(n,n)</math>, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].\n\n=== Logistic growth ===\n[[File:Verhulst-Malthus.svg|thumb|The J-shaped exponential growth (left, blue) and the S-shaped logistic growth (right, red).]]\n{{main|Logistic curve}}\nIn reality, initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever.

It occurs when the instantaneous [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]] (that is, the [[derivative]]) of a quantity with respect to time is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the quantity itself. Described as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], a quantity undergoing exponential growth is an [[exponential function]] of time, that is, the variable representing time is the exponent (in contrast to other types of growth, such as [[quadratic growth]]). \n\nIf the constant of proportionality is negative, then the quantity decreases over time, and is said to be undergoing [[exponential decay]] instead. In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''' since the function values form a [[geometric progression]].\n\nThe formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;...), is\n\n:<math>x_t = x_0(1+r)^t</math>\n\nwhere ''x''<sub>0</sub> is the value of ''x'' at time 0. The growth of a [[bacteria]]l [[Colony (biology)|colony]] is often used to illustrate it. One bacterium splits itself into two, each of which splits itself resulting in four, then eight, 16, 32, and so on. The rate of increase keeps increasing because it is proportional to the ever-increasing number of bacteria. Growth like this is observed in real-life activity or phenomena, such as the spread of virus infection, the growth of debt due to [[compound interest]], and the spread of [[viral video]]s. In real cases, initial exponential growth often do not last forever, slowing down due to upper limits caused by external factors and turning into the [[logistic curve|logistic growth]].\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:e.coli-colony-growth.gif|right|frame|150px|[[Bacteria]] exhibit exponential growth under optimal conditions.]]\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\n===Biology===\n* The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism and gene expression.<ref name=\"SlavovBudnik2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705\u2013714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}</ref>    \n* A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.\n\n===Physics===\n* [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.\n* [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. \"Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3\u20134 generations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>\n* [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequency|component frequencies]] of the signal over others.\n\n===Economics===\n* [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.\n\n===Finance===\n* [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital.{{sfn|Crauder|Evans|Noell|2008|pp=314\u2013315}} See also [[rule of 72]].\n* [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.\n\n===Computer science===\n* [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)\n* In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2<sup>''x''</sup>, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.\n=== Internet phenomena ===\n* Internet contents, such as [[internet meme]]s or [[viral video|video]]s, can spread in an exponential manner, often said to \"[[viral phenomenon|go viral]]\" as an analogy to the spread of viruses.<ref name=aca>{{cite web|title=To Go Viral|author=Ariel Cintr\u00f3n-Arias|date=2014|arxiv=1402.3499}}</ref> With media such as [[social networks]], one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously, who then spread it to even more people, and so on, causing rapid spread.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|author1=Karine Nahon|author2=Jeff Hemsley|title=Going Viral|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hjdh8fID3nUC&pg=PA16|date=2013|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-7129-1|p=16}}</ref>  For example, the video [[Gangnam Style]] was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 15 July 2012, reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers on the first day, millions on the twentieth day, and was cumulatively viewed by hundreds of millions in less than two months.<ref name=aca/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube-trends.blogspot.com/2012/09/gangnam-style-vs-call-me-maybe.html|title=Gangnam Style vs Call Me Maybe: A Popularity Comparison|work=YouTube Trends|author=YouTube|date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Basic formula==\nA quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if\n\n:<math>x(t)=a\\cdot b^{t/\\tau}</math>\n\nwhere the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',\n\n:<math>x(0)=a\\, ,</math>\n\nthe constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''\u03c4'' is the [[time constant]]\u2014the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':\n\n:<math>x(t+\\tau)=a \\cdot b^{\\frac{t+\\tau}{\\tau}} = a \\cdot b^{\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\cdot b^{\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau}} = x(t)\\cdot b\\, .</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''\u03c4'' > 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' > 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''\u03c4'' < 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' > 1}}, or {{nowrap|''\u03c4'' > 0}}  and 0 < {{nowrap|''b'' < 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].\n\nExample: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and ''\u03c4''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;min.\n\n:<math>x(t)=a\\cdot b^{t/\\tau}=1\\cdot 2^{(60\\text{ min})/(10\\text{ min})}</math>\n\n:<math>x(1\\text{ hr})= 1 \\cdot 2^6 =64.</math>\n\nAfter one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.\n\nMany pairs (''b'',&nbsp;''\u03c4'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''\u03c4'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''\u03c4'' proportional to log&nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''\u03c4''. For any non-zero time ''\u03c4'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&nbsp;''b''.\n\nThus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:\n\n:<math>x(t) = x_0\\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\\cdot e^{t/\\tau} = x_0 \\cdot 2^{t/T}\n= x_0\\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^{t/p},</math>\n\nwhere ''x''<sub>0</sub> expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).\n\nParameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):\n* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].\n* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''\u03c4'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.\n* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.\n* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.\nThe quantities ''k'', ''\u03c4'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):\n\n:<math>k = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T} = \\frac{\\ln \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)}{p}</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''\u03c4'' and ''T'' being infinite.\n\nIf ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.\n\nA popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],\nthat is, <math>T \\simeq 70 / r</math>.\n\n{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations.

For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.\n\n==Differential equation==\nThe [[exponential function]] <math>x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}</math> satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\!\\, \\frac{dx}{dt} = kx</math>\n\nsaying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]\n:<math>x(0).</math>\n\nThe differential equation is solved by direct integration:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} & = kx \\\\[5pt]\n\\frac{dx} x & = k\\, dt \\\\[5pt]\n\\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \\frac{dx}{x} & = k \\int_0^t  \\, dt \\\\[5pt]\n\\ln \\frac{x(t)}{x(0)} & =  kt.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nso that\n\n: <math> x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}</math>\n\nIn the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' < 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].\n\nFor a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].\n\n==Difference equation==\nThe [[difference equation]]\n\n:<math>x_t = a \\cdot x_{t-1}</math>\n\nhas solution\n\n:<math>x_t = x_0 \\cdot a^t,</math>\n\nshowing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.\n\n== Other growth rates ==\nIn the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, that is, for all \u03b1:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty} {t^\\alpha \\over ae^t} =0.</math>\n\nThere is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See {{sectionlink|Degree of a polynomial|Computed from the function values}}.\n\nGrowth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and <math>A(n,n)</math>, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].\n\n=== Logistic growth ===\n[[File:Verhulst-Malthus.svg|thumb|The J-shaped exponential growth (left, blue) and the S-shaped logistic growth (right, red).]]\n{{main|Logistic curve}}\nIn reality, initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever.

He was born into a noble [[Campania]]n family about 19 BC, although the place of his birth is unknown.  He was a great-great-great-grandson of Minatus Magius of [[Aeculanum]] in [[Samnium]], who received the [[Roman citizenship|Roman franchise]] for his actions during the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].  Several of his ancestors in subsequent generations held important [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]] or military commands, including his uncle, Capito, who was a member of the [[Roman Senate]].<ref name=\"DGRBM\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography'', vol. III, pp. 134, 135 (\"C. Velleius Paterculus\").</ref>\n\nAs a young man, Velleius served as a [[military tribune]] in Rome's eastern provinces.  In AD 2, he was with the army of [[Gaius Caesar]], and personally witnessed the meeting between the young general and [[Phraates V]] of [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] on the banks of the [[Euphrates]].  Two years later, Velleius was a cavalry [[prefect]] serving in the command of [[Tiberius]] in [[Germania]], having already held the office of ''[[praefectus castrorum]]''.  He continued as a senior member of Tiberius' staff until the future emperor's return to Rome in AD 12.  While serving under Tiberius, Velleius was also elected [[quaestor]], an important step on the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', filling that office in AD 7.<ref name =\"EB\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>\n\nBefore his death in AD 14, the emperor [[Augustus]] designated Velleius and his brother, Magius Celer, for the [[praetor]]ship.  The emperor died before the ''comitia'' could be held, and so the two brothers were formally elected under Tiberius, serving their year of office in AD 15.  Few other particulars of Velleius' life are known; he dedicated his history to [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 30)|Marcus Vinicius]], and from his description of events during the latter's consulship in AD 30, Velleius must still have been alive that year.  But Velleius was among the friends of [[Sejanus]], whom he praises in his writing, and as there is no evidence that the historian survived his friend's downfall by any great length of time, it seems likely that he shared his fate.<ref name =\"EB\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM\"/><ref>Syme, \"Seianus on the Aventine\", p. 265.</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nHis ''Compendium of Roman History'' consists of two books dedicated to M. Vinicius, and covers the period from the dispersion of the [[Greeks]] after the [[Trojan War|siege of Troy]] down to the death of [[Livia]] (AD 29). The first book brings the history down to the destruction of [[Carthage]] in 146 BC; portions of it are missing, including the beginning. The later history, especially the period from the death of [[Julius Caesar]], 44 BC, to the death of [[Augustus]], AD 14, is treated in much greater detail. \n\nThe author does not display real historical insight, although generally trustworthy in his statements of individual facts. He may be regarded as something of a courtly annalist,<ref>J E Sandys, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1894) p. 680</ref>  rather than an historian. His chronology is inconsistent, though sometimes useful.<ref>S Usher, ''The Historians of Greece and Rome'' (London 1969) p. 243</ref> On Caesar, Augustus, and above all on his patron Tiberius, he lavishes praise or flattery; but his portrait of the latter is a useful corrective to the sensationalist attacks of a [[Tacitus]],<ref>H J Rose, '' A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1966) p. 356</ref> as is his treatment of [[Livia]].<ref>J Balsdon, Roman Women (London 1962) p. 90</ref>  The repetitions, redundancies, and slovenliness of expression may be partly due to the haste with which (as the author frequently states) it was written. The inflated [[rhetoric]], the straining after effect by means of [[hyperbole]], [[antithesis]] and [[epigram]], belong firmly to the [[Silver Latin|Silver Age]],<ref>S Usher, ''The Historians of Greece and Rome'' (London 1969) p. 242</ref> of which Paterculus is the earliest example. He purposed to write a fuller history of the later period, including the [[civil war]] between Caesar and [[Pompey]] and the wars of Tiberius; but there is no evidence that he did so. His chief authorities were [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s ''Origines'', the ''Annales'' of [[Quintus Hortensius]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], [[Cornelius Nepos]], and [[Livy]].{{citeneeded|date=October 2019}}\n\nVelleius Paterculus was little known in antiquity. He seems to have been read by [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]] and imitated by [[Sulpicius Severus]], but he is mentioned only by the scholiast on Lucan, except once by Priscian.\n\n===Literary interests===\nBrief notices are given of Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[literature]] in specific chapters, perhaps indebted to [[Cicero]].<ref>S Usher, The Historians of Greece and Rome (London 1969) p. 243</ref> No mention is made of [[Plautus]], [[Horace]] or [[Propertius]],{{citeneeded|date=October 2019}} but he does provide unique details for [[Lucius Afranius]] and [[Lucius Pomponius]].<ref>H J Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1966) p. 81 and p. 148</ref>\n\nHis interesting judgement that the peak of perfection in any literary field is arrived at quickly by the first arrivals should not be seen as an original one, but rather as reflecting the standard views of the day.<ref>J Boardman ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1986) p. 678</ref>\n\n==Early editions==\n[[File:Historia romana.tif|thumb|''Historia romana'', 1600]]\nThe text of the work was preserved in a single badly written and mutilated manuscript (discovered by [[Beatus Rhenanus]] in 1515 in [[Murbach Abbey]] in [[Alsace]], and very corrupt).

At the age of nine the family, now including a younger sister, moved to the [[Cayman Islands]] where Owen attended Cayman Islands Middle School, while nurturing a life long love of the ocean. Upon returning to the UK the family, missing the warm weather and sea air, moved to [[St_Ives,_Cornwall|St. Ives]] in [[Cornwall]] at the south-western tip of the country.
