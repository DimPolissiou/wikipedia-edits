His major compositions for choir and vocal soloists are mainly based on texts from the Bible or sacred themes. Old church music, especially [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, have had a major influence on his compositions.\n\n==Career==\nNystedt studied with [[Aaron Copland]] among others. He was the organist in the Torshov Church in Oslo from 1946 to 1982 and taught choir conducting at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1964 to 1985.\n\nNystedt founded and conducted the [[Det Norske Solistkor|Norwegian Soloists' Choir]] from 1950 to 1990. He also founded and conducted the [[Schola Cantorum (Norwegian choir)|Schola Cantorum]] from 1964 to 1985. The choir [[Ensemble 96]]  published \"Immortal Nystedt\" in 2005. This CD was nominated in two categories in the 2007 Grammy Awards and was the first Norwegian CD so nominated. It was also the first CD with a Norwegian composer nominated for a Grammy. On the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2005, there were several concerts around the world held in his honour.\n\nKey Nystedt works include the symphony ''Apocalypsis Joannis'' for soloists, choir and orchestra, op. 155 (1998), commissioned by the [[Oslo Philharmonic]]; ''Ode til mennesket'', op. 159 (2000), featuring texts by Sophocles, Hippocrates and Plato; ''The Word Became Flesh'', op. 162 (2001), commissioned by the Augsburg College Choir; and ''Reach Out For Peace'' for soprano, choir and orchestra, op. 164 A (2001), commissioned by the Ceciliaforeningen.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url= http://musicnorway.no/artist/knut-nystedt/ |title= Bio from Music Norway |website= musicnorway.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the King of Norway made Nystedt a Knight of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav|Order of St. Olav]] in recognition of his contributions to Norwegian music,<ref name=ListenToNorwayBio/> and in 2002 the King made him a Commander of St. Olav. He received the [[Spellemannsprisen|Spellemann Award]] in 1978 for his album ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' and received the music prize of the [[Arts Council Norway]] in 1980.  In 1965, ''De Profundis'' was bestowed with the ''Work of the Year'' award of the [[Norwegian Society of Composers]].

His major compositions for choir and vocal soloists are mainly based on texts from the Bible or sacred themes. Old church music, especially [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, have had a major influence on his compositions.\n\n==Career==\nNystedt studied with [[Aaron Copland]] among others. He was the organist in the Torshov Church in Oslo from 1946 to 1982 and taught choir conducting at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1964 to 1985.\n\nNystedt founded and conducted the [[Det Norske Solistkor|Norwegian Soloists' Choir]] from 1950 to 1990. He also founded and conducted the [[Schola Cantorum (Norwegian choir)|Schola Cantorum]] from 1964 to 1985. The choir [[Ensemble 96]]  published \"Immortal Nystedt\" in 2005. This CD was nominated in two categories in the 2007 Grammy Awards and was the first Norwegian CD so nominated. It was also the first CD with a Norwegian composer nominated for a Grammy. On the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2005, there were several concerts around the world held in his honour.\n\nKey Nystedt works include the symphony ''Apocalypsis Joannis'' for soloists, choir and orchestra, op. 155 (1998), commissioned by the [[Oslo Philharmonic]]; ''Ode til mennesket'', op. 159 (2000), featuring texts by Sophocles, Hippocrates and Plato; ''The Word Became Flesh'', op. 162 (2001), commissioned by the Augsburg College Choir; and ''Reach Out For Peace'' for soprano, choir and orchestra, op. 164 A (2001), commissioned by the Ceciliaforeningen.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://musicnorway.no/artist/knut-nystedt/ |title= Bio from Music Norway |website= musicnorway.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the King of Norway made Nystedt a Knight of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav|Order of St. Olav]] in recognition of his contributions to Norwegian music,<ref name=ListenToNorwayBio/> and in 2002 the King made him a Commander of St. Olav. He received the [[Spellemannsprisen|Spellemann Award]] in 1978 for his album ''Contemporary Music From Norway'' and received the music prize of the [[Arts Council Norway]] in 1980.  In 1965, ''De Profundis'' was bestowed with the ''Work of the Year'' award of the [[Norwegian Society of Composers]]. Nystedt was awarded an honorary professorship ('Professor Honorario') by Mendoza University Argentina in 1991. In 2002 he received the ''Choir Prize of the Year'' from the Norwegian Choir Association and in 2005 the Artists' Prize by the City of [[Oslo]].\n\nMost of his compositions were published by Norsk Musikkforlag.

A separate species, ''[[Viscum cruciatum]]'', occurs in Southwest [[Spain]] and Southern [[Portugal]], as well as [[Morocco]] ([[North Africa]]) and southern Africa.<ref name=PWO/> The genus ''Viscum'' is not native to North America, but ''Viscum album'' was introduced to Northern California in 1900.<ref>USDA, NRCS. 2009.

The Eastern mistletoe of North America is similar, but has shorter, broader leaves and longer clusters of 10 or more berries.\n\nThe eastern mistletoe native to [[North America]], ''[[Phoradendron leucarpum]]'', belongs to a distinct genus of the family [[Santalaceae]]. \n\nOver the centuries, the term has been broadened to include many other species of parasitic plants with similar habits, found in other parts of the world, that are classified in different [[genus|genera]] and families such as the [[Misodendraceae]] of Chile and Argentina and the mainly southern hemisphere tropical [[Loranthaceae]].\n\n\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'mistletoe' derives from the older form 'mistle' adding the Old English word ''t\u0101n'' (twig).

A. Barlow (1983) A revision of the Viscaceae of Australia. Brunonia 6, 25\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Life cycle==\nMistletoe species grow on a wide range of [[Host (biology)|host tree]]s, some of which experience side effects including reduced growth, stunting, and loss of infested outer branches. A heavy infestation may also kill the host plant. ''Viscum album'' successfully parasitizes more than 200 tree and shrub species.\n\n[[File:Mistleltoe in Lebanon.JPG|thumb|Mistletoe in winter]]\n\nAll mistletoe species are [[parasitic plant|hemiparasites]] because they do perform some photosynthesis for some period of their life cycle. However, in some species its contribution is very nearly zero. For example, some species, such as ''[[Viscum minimum]]'', that parasitize [[Succulent plant|succulent]]s, commonly species of Cactaceae or Euphorbiaceae, grow largely within the host plant, with hardly more than the flower and fruit emerging. Once they have germinated and attached to the circulatory system of the host, their photosynthesis reduces so far that it becomes insignificant.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\">{{cite book |author=Visser, Johann |title=South African parasitic flowering plants |publisher=Juta |location=Cape Town |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7021-1228-7 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>\n\nMost of the Viscaceae bear evergreen [[leaf|leaves]] that [[photosynthesis]]e effectively, and photosynthesis proceeds within their green, fleshy stems as well. Some species, such as ''[[Viscum capense]]'', are adapted to semi-arid conditions and their leaves are [[vestigial]] scales, hardly visible without detailed morphological investigation. Therefore, their photosynthesis and transpiration only take place in their stems, limiting their demands on the host's supply of water, but also limiting their intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Accordingly, their contribution to the host's metabolic balance becomes trivial and the idle parasite may become quite yellow as it grows, having practically given up photosynthesis.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\"/>\n\nAt another extreme other species have vigorous green leaves. Not only do they photosynthesize actively, but a heavy infestation of mistletoe plants may take over whole host tree branches, sometimes killing practically the entire crown and replacing it with their own growth. In such a tree the host is relegated purely to the supply of water and mineral nutrients and the physical support of the trunk. Such a tree may survive as a ''Viscum'' community for years; it resembles a totally unknown species unless one examines it closely, because its foliage does not look like that of any tree. An example of a species that behaves in this manner is ''Viscum continuum''.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\"/>\n\nA mistletoe seed germinates on the branch of a host tree or shrub, and in its early stages of development it is independent of its host. It commonly has two or even four embryos, each producing its [[hypocotyl]], that grows towards the bark of the host under the influence of light and gravity, and potentially each forming a mistletoe plant in a clump. Possibly as an adaptation to assist in guiding the process of growing away from the light, the adhesive on the seed tends to darken the bark. On having made contact with the bark, the hypocotyl, with only a rudimentary scrap of root tissue at its tip penetrates it, a process that may take a year or more. In the meantime the plant is dependent on its own photosynthesis. Only after it reaches the host's conductive tissue can it begin to rely on the host for its needs. Later it forms a haustorium that penetrates the host tissue and takes water and nutrients from the host plant.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\"/>\n\nSpecies more or less obligate include the leafless quintral, ''[[Tristerix]] aphyllus'', which lives deep inside the sugar-transporting tissue of a spiny cactus, appearing only to show its tubular red flowers,<ref>Susan Milius, \"Botany under the Mistletoe\" ''Science News'' '''158'''.26/27 (December 2000:412).</ref>    and the genus  ''[[Arceuthobium]]'' (dwarf mistletoe; Santalaceae) which has reduced photosynthesis; as an adult, it manufactures only a small proportion of the [[sugars]] it needs from its own photosynthesis, but as a [[seedling]] actively photosynthesizes until a connection to the host is established.\n\nSome species of the largest family, Loranthaceae, have small, [[insect pollination|insect-pollinated]] [[flowers]] (as with Santalaceae), but others have spectacularly showy, large, [[bird pollination|bird-pollinated]] flowers.\n\nMost mistletoe seeds are spread by birds that eat the 'seeds' (in actuality [[drupe]]s). Of the many bird species that feed on them, the [[mistle thrush]] is the best-known in Europe, the ''[[Phainopepla]]'' in southwestern North America, and ''[[Dicaeum]]'' of Asia and Australia. Depending on the species of mistletoe and the species of bird, the seeds are regurgitated from the crop, excreted in their droppings, or stuck to the bill, from which the bird wipes it onto a suitable branch. The seeds are coated with a sticky material called [[viscin]]. Some viscin remains on the seed and when it touches a stem, it sticks tenaciously. The viscin soon hardens and attaches the seed firmly to its future host, where it germinates and its haustorium penetrates the sound bark.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zulu Journal|year=1959|url=https://archive.org/details/zulujournalfield0000cowl|url-access=registration|accessdate=17 May 2013|publisher=University of California Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/zulujournalfield0000cowl/page/114 114]\u2013|id=GGKEY:5QX6L53RH1U}}</ref>\n\nSpecialist mistletoe eaters have adaptations that expedite the process; some pass the seeds through their unusually shaped digestive tracts so fast that a pause for defecation of the seeds is part of the feeding routine.

In western North America their juicy berries are eaten and spread by birds (notably [[Phainopepla]], or silky-flycatcher) while in [[Australia]] the [[mistletoebird]] behaves similarly. When eaten, some seeds pass unharmed through their digestive systems; if the birds\u2019 droppings happen to land on a suitable branch, the seeds may stick long enough to germinate. As the plants mature, they grow into masses of branching stems which suggest the popular name \"witches\u2019 brooms\". The dense evergreen [[witch's broom|witches' brooms]] formed by the [[dwarf mistletoe]]s (''[[Arceuthobium]]'' species) of western North America also make excellent locations for roosting and nesting of the northern [[spotted owl]] and the [[marbled murrelet]]. In Australia the [[diamond firetail]] and painted [[honeyeater]] are recorded as nesting in different mistletoes. This behavior is probably far more widespread than currently recognized; more than 240 species of birds that nest in foliage in Australia have been recorded nesting in mistletoe, representing more than 75% of the resident birds.\n\nA study of mistletoe in junipers concluded that more juniper berries sprout in stands where mistletoe is present, as the mistletoe attracts berry-eating birds which also eat juniper berries.<ref>Susan Milius, \"Mistletoe, of All Things, Helps Juniper Trees\" ''Science News'' '''161'''.1 (January 2002:6).</ref>  Such interactions lead to dramatic influences on diversity, as areas with greater mistletoe densities support higher diversities of animals.

A heavy infestation may also kill the host plant. ''Viscum album'' successfully parasitizes more than 200 tree and shrub species.\n\n[[File:Mistleltoe in Lebanon.JPG|thumb|Mistletoe in winter]]\n\nAll mistletoe species are [[parasitic plant|hemiparasites]], because they do perform at least a little photosynthesis for at least a short period of their life cycle. However, in some species its contribution is very nearly zero. For example, some species, such as ''[[Viscum minimum]]'', that parasitize [[Succulent plant|succulent]]s, commonly species of Cactaceae or Euphorbiaceae, grow largely within the host plant, with hardly more than the flower and fruit emerging. Once they have germinated and attached to the circulatory system of the host, their photosynthesis reduces so far that it becomes insignificant.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\">{{cite book |author=Visser, Johann |title=South African parasitic flowering plants |publisher=Juta |location=Cape Town |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7021-1228-7 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>\n\nMost of the Viscaceae bear evergreen [[leaf|leaves]] that [[photosynthesis]]e effectively, and photosynthesis proceeds within their green, fleshy stems as well. Some species, such as ''[[Viscum capense]]'', are adapted to semi-arid conditions and their leaves are [[vestigial]] scales, hardly visible without detailed morphological investigation. Therefore, their photosynthesis and transpiration only take place in their stems, limiting their demands on the host's supply of water, but also limiting their intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Accordingly, their contribution to the host's metabolic balance becomes trivial and the idle parasite may become quite yellow as it grows, having practically given up photosynthesis.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\"/>\n\nAt another extreme other species have vigorous green leaves. Not only do they photosynthesize actively, but a heavy infestation of mistletoe plants may take over whole host tree branches, sometimes killing practically the entire crown and replacing it with their own growth. In such a tree the host is relegated purely to the supply of water and mineral nutrients and the physical support of the trunk. Such a tree may survive as a ''Viscum'' community for years; it resembles a totally unknown species unless one examines it closely, because its foliage does not look like that of any tree. An example of a species that behaves in this manner is ''Viscum continuum''.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\"/>\n\nA mistletoe seed germinates on the branch of a host tree or shrub, and in its early stages of development it is independent of its host. It commonly has two or even four embryos, each producing its [[hypocotyl]], that grows towards the bark of the host under the influence of light and gravity, and potentially each forming a mistletoe plant in a clump. Possibly as an adaptation to assist in guiding the process of growing away from the light, the adhesive on the seed tends to darken the bark. On having made contact with the bark, the hypocotyl, with only a rudimentary scrap of root tissue at its tip penetrates it, a process that may take a year or more. In the meantime the plant is dependent on its own photosynthesis. Only after it reaches the host's conductive tissue can it begin to rely on the host for its needs. Later it forms a haustorium that penetrates the host tissue and takes water and nutrients from the host plant.<ref name= \"isbn0-7021-1228-3\"/>\n\nSpecies more or less obligate include the leafless quintral, ''[[Tristerix]] aphyllus'', which lives deep inside the sugar-transporting tissue of a spiny cactus, appearing only to show its tubular red flowers,<ref>Susan Milius, \"Botany under the Mistletoe\" ''Science News'' '''158'''.26/27 (December 2000:412).</ref>    and the genus  ''[[Arceuthobium]]'' (dwarf mistletoe; Santalaceae) which has reduced photosynthesis; as an adult, it manufactures only a small proportion of the [[sugars]] it needs from its own photosynthesis, but as a [[seedling]] actively photosynthesizes until a connection to the host is established.\n\nSome species of the largest family, Loranthaceae, have small, [[insect pollination|insect-pollinated]] [[flowers]] (as with Santalaceae), but others have spectacularly showy, large, [[bird pollination|bird-pollinated]] flowers.\n\nMost mistletoe seeds are spread by birds that eat the 'seeds' (in actuality [[drupe]]s). Of the many bird species that feed on them, the [[mistle thrush]] is the best-known in Europe, the ''[[Phainopepla]]'' in southwestern North America, and ''[[Dicaeum]]'' of Asia and Australia. Depending on the species of mistletoe and the species of bird, the seeds are regurgitated from the crop, excreted in their droppings, or stuck to the bill, from which the bird wipes it onto a suitable branch. The seeds are coated with a sticky material called [[viscin]]. Some viscin remains on the seed and when it touches a stem, it sticks tenaciously.

Watson]], \"Mistletoe-A Keystone Resource in Forests and Woodlands Worldwide\" ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''32''' (2001:219\u2013249).</ref> A broad array of animals depend on mistletoe for food, consuming the leaves and young shoots, transferring [[pollen]] between plants and dispersing the sticky seeds. In western North America their juicy berries are eaten and spread by birds (notably [[Phainopepla]], or silky-flycatcher) while in [[Australia]] the [[mistletoebird]] behaves similarly. When eaten, some seeds pass unharmed through their digestive systems; if the birds\u2019 droppings happen to land on a suitable branch, the seeds may stick long enough to germinate. As the plants mature, they grow into masses of branching stems which suggest the popular name \"witches\u2019 brooms\". The dense evergreen [[witch's broom|witches' brooms]] formed by the [[dwarf mistletoe]]s (''[[Arceuthobium]]'' species) of western North America also make excellent locations for roosting and nesting of the northern [[spotted owl]] and the [[marbled murrelet]]. In Australia the [[diamond firetail]] and painted [[honeyeater]] are recorded as nesting in different mistletoes. This behavior is probably far more widespread than currently recognized; more than 240 species of birds that nest in foliage in Australia have been recorded nesting in mistletoe, representing more than 75% of the resident birds.\n\nA study of mistletoe in junipers concluded that more juniper berries sprout in stands where mistletoe is present, as the mistletoe attracts berry-eating birds which also eat juniper berries.<ref>Susan Milius, \"Mistletoe, of All Things, Helps Juniper Trees\" ''Science News'' '''161'''.1 (January 2002:6).</ref>  Such interactions lead to dramatic influences on diversity, as areas with greater mistletoe densities support higher diversities of animals.

Footwear in the manner of [[shoe]]s therefore primarily serves the purpose to ease the locomotion and prevent injuries. Secondly footwear can also be used for [[fashion]] and [[adornment]] as well as to indicate the status or rank of the person within a [[social structure]]. \n[[Sock]]s and other [[hosiery]] are typically worn additionally between the feet and other footwear for further comfort and relief.\nCultures have different customs regarding footwear. These include not using any in some situations, usually bearing a symbolic meaning. This can however also be imposed on specific individuals to place them at a practical disadvantage against shod people, if they are excluded from having footwear available or are prohibited from using any. This usually takes place in situations of captivity, such as [[imprisonment]] or [[slavery]], where the groups are among other things distinctly divided by whether or whether not footwear is being worn. In these cases the use of footwear categorically indicates the exercise of power as against being devoid of footwear, evidently indicating inferiority.\n\nIn some cultures, people remove their shoes before entering a home. Bare feet are also seen as a sign of humility and respect, and adherents of many religions worship or mourn while barefoot. Some religious communities explicitly require people to remove shoes before they enter holy buildings, such as temples.\n\nIn several cultures people remove their shoes as a sign of respect towards someone of higher standing. In a similar context deliberately forcing other people to go barefoot while being shod oneself has been used to clearly showcase and convey one's superiority within a setting of power disparity.\n\nPractitioners of the craft of [[shoemaking]] are called shoemakers, cobblers, or [[cordwainer]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chalcolithic leather shoe from Areni-1 cave.jpg|thumb|[[Chalcolithic]] leather shoe; ca. 5.000 BCE\n]]\nFootwear has been in use since the earliest human history, archeological finds of complete shoes date back to the [[Chalcolithic|copper age]] (ca. 5.000 BCE).

Footwear in the manner of [[shoe]]s therefore primarily serves the purpose to ease the locomotion and prevent injuries. Secondly footwear can also be used for [[fashion]] and [[adornment]] as well as to indicate the status or rank of the person within a [[social structure]]. \n[[Sock]]s and other [[hosiery]] are typically worn additionally between the feet and other footwear for further comfort and relief.\nCultures have different customs regarding footwear. These include not using any in some situations, usually bearing a symbolic meaning. This can however also be imposed on specific individuals to place them at a practical disadvantage against shod people, if they are excluded from having footwear available or are prohibited from using any. This usually takes place in situations of captivity, such as [[imprisonment]] or [[slavery]], where the groups are among other things distinctly divided by whether or whether not footwear is being worn. In these cases the use of footwear categorically indicates the exercise of power as against being devoid of footwear, evidently indicating inferiority.\n\nIn some cultures, people remove their shoes before entering a home. Bare feet are also seen as a sign of humility and respect, and adherents of many religions worship or mourn while barefoot. Some religious communities explicitly require people to remove shoes before they enter holy buildings, such as temples.\n\nIn several cultures people remove their shoes as a sign of respect towards someone of higher standing. In a similar context deliberately forcing other people to go barefoot while being shod oneself has been used to clearly showcase and convey one's superiority within a setting of power disparity.\n\nPractitioners of the craft of [[shoemaking]] are called shoemakers, cobblers, or [[cordwainer]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chalcolithic leather shoe from Areni-1 cave.jpg|thumb|[[Chalcolithic]] leather shoe; ca. 5.000 BCE\n]]\nFootwear has been in use since the earliest human history, archeological finds of complete shoes date back to the [[Chalcolithic|copper age]] (ca. 5.000 BCE). Some ancient civilizations, such as [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]] however saw no practical need for footwear due to convenient climatic and landscape situations and used shoes primarily as ornaments and insignia of power.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] saw clothing and footwear as unmistakable signs of power and status in society, and most Romans wore footwear, while slaves and peasants remained [[barefoot]].<ref name=\"DeMello2009\">{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and footwear: a cultural encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&pg=PA65|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|pages=65\u2013}}</ref> The [[Middle Ages]] saw the rise of high-heeled shoes, also associated with power, and the desire to look larger than life, and artwork from that period often depicts bare feet as a symbol of poverty. Depictions of captives such as prisoners or slaves from the same period well into the 18th century show the individuals barefooted almost exclusively, at this contrasting the prevailing partakers of the scene.

By 1580, men also wore them, and a person with authority or wealth might be described as, ''well-heeled''.

She was the daughter of [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]], the brother of kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. Margaret was one of two women in 16th-century England to be a peeress in her own right with no titled husband.<ref>''ODNB''; the other was [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Marquess of Pembroke]]. The ''ODNB'' does not qualify the assertion, but is discussing sixteenth-century usage; sources which apply modern law retroactively will consider some women peeresses in their own right when their husbands sat in Parliament with their father's style and precedence.</ref> One of the few surviving members of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]] after the [[Wars of the Roses]], she was executed in 1541 at the command of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who was the son of her first cousin [[Elizabeth of York]]. [[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] her as a martyr for the [[Catholic Church]] on 29 December 1886.<ref>DWYER, J. G. \"Pole, Margaret Plantagenet, Bl.\" ''New Catholic Encyclopedia.'' 2nd ed. Vol. 11. Detroit: Gale, 2003. pp. 455\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMargaret was born at [[Farleigh Hungerford Castle]] in Somerset, the only surviving daughter of [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and his wife [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel Neville]], who was the elder daughter of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], and his wife [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick|Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick]]. Her maternal grandfather was killed fighting against her uncle, [[Edward IV]], at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. Her father, already Duke of Clarence, was then created Earl of Salisbury and of Warwick. Edward IV declared that Margaret's younger brother [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward]] should be known as [[Earl of Warwick]] as a courtesy title, but no peerage was ever created for him. Margaret would have had a claim to the Earldom of Warwick, but the earldom was forfeited on the [[attainder]] of her brother Edward.<ref name=\"ODNB\">''ODNB''.</ref>\n\nMargaret's mother died when she was three, and her father had two servants killed whom he thought had poisoned her. George plotted against Edward IV, and was attainted and executed for treason; his lands and titles were forfeited. Edward IV died when Margaret was ten, and her uncle [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], declared that Edward's marriage was invalid, his children illegitimate, and that Margaret and her brother Edward were debarred from the throne by their father's attainder. Married to [[Anne Neville]], younger sister to Margaret's mother Isabel, Richard assumed the throne himself as Richard III.\n\nRichard III sent the children to [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] in Yorkshire. He was defeated and killed in 1485 at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] by Henry Tudor, who succeeded him as [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. The new king married Margaret's cousin [[Elizabeth of York]], Edward IV's daughter, and Margaret and her brother were taken into their care. Soon young Edward, a potential [[House of York|York]] claimant to the throne, was moved to the [[Tower of London]]. Edward was briefly displayed in public at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1487 in response to the presentation of the impostor [[Lambert Simnel]] as the \"Earl of Warwick\" to the Irish lords. Shortly thereafter, probably in November 1487, Henry VII gave Margaret in marriage to his cousin, [[Sir Richard Pole]], whose mother was half-sister of the king's mother, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]].<ref name=Catholic/> When [[Perkin Warbeck]] impersonated Edward IV's presumed-dead son [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York]], in 1499, Margaret's brother Edward was attainted and executed for involvement in the plot. Richard Pole held a variety of offices in Henry VII's government, the highest being Chamberlain for [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], Henry's elder son. When Arthur married [[Catherine of Aragon]], Margaret became one of her [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], but her entourage was dissolved when the teenaged Arthur died in 1502.\n[[File:Margaret de la pole.jpg|alt=part of a family portrait possible Victorian copy of a real engraving  |thumb|Margaret as a child ]]\nWhen her husband died in 1505, Margaret was a widow with five children, a limited amount of land inherited from her husband, no other income and no prospects. Henry VII paid for Richard's funeral. To ease the situation, Margaret devoted her third son [[Reginald Pole]] to the Church, where he was to have an eventful career as a papal Legate and later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Nonetheless, he was to resent her abandonment of him bitterly in later life.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />  Additionally, Margaret, without adequate means to support herself and her children, was forced to live at [[Syon Monastery|Syon Abbey]] among Bridgettine nuns after her husband's death.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Margaret Pole and Syon abbey|last = Powell|first = Sue|date = 1 November 2005|journal = Historical Research |volume = 78|issue = 202|pages = 563\u2013567|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2005.00254.x|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> She was to remain there until she returned to favour at the ascension of [[Henry VIII]] in 1509.     \n\n==Countess of Salisbury==\nWhen Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509, he married Catherine of Aragon himself. Margaret was again appointed one of her ladies-in-waiting. In 1512, Parliament restored to her some of her brother's lands of the earldom of Salisbury (only), for which she paid 5000 marks (\u00a32666.13s.4d). Henry VII had controlled them, first during her brother's minority and then during his imprisonment, and had confiscated them after his trial. The same Act also restored to Margaret the Earldom of Salisbury.<ref>ODNB, which argues that the restoration was a tacit admission of her brother's innocence; however, lands and titles had been restored to the heirs of guilty peers during the previous century.</ref> The Warwick and Spencer [Despencer] lands remained crown property.<ref>TNA, minsters' accounts, SC6/HENVIII.</ref>\n\nAs Countess of Salisbury, Margaret managed her lands well, and by 1538, she was the fifth richest peer in England. She was a patron of the [[new learning]], like many Renaissance nobles; [[Gentian Hervet]] translated [[Erasmus]]' ''de immensa misericordia Dei'' (''The Great Mercy of God'') into English for her. Her first son, [[Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu|Henry Pole]], was created [[Baron Montagu]], another of the Neville titles; he spoke for the family in the House of Lords. Her second son, [[Arthur Pole (1499\u20131532)|Arthur Pole]], had a generally successful career as a courtier, becoming one of the six Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. He suffered a setback when his patron [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], was convicted of treason in 1521, but he was soon restored to favour. He died young about 1526, having married the heir of Roger Lewknor; the Countess and her son Henry pressed Arthur's widow to a vow of perpetual chastity to preserve her inheritance for her Pole children. Margaret's daughter [[Ursula Pole, Baroness Stafford|Ursula]] married the Duke of Buckingham's son, [[Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford|Henry Stafford]], but after the Duke's fall, the couple was given only fragments of his estates.\n\nMargaret's third son, [[Reginald Pole]], studied abroad in Padua; he was dean in Exeter and Wimborne Minster, Dorset as well as canon in York. He had several other livings, although he had not been ordained a priest. He represented Henry VIII in Paris in 1529, persuading the theologians of the [[Sorbonne]] to support Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon.<ref>ODNB, Reginald Pole</ref> Her youngest son [[Geoffrey Pole]] married well, to Constance, daughter of Edmund Pakenham, and inherited the estate of [[Lordington House|Lordington]] in Sussex.\n\nMargaret's own favour at Court varied. She had a dispute over land with Henry VIII in 1518; he awarded the contested lands to the [[Dukedom of Somerset]], which had been held by his Beaufort grandfather\u2014and were now in the possession of the Crown. In 1520, Margaret was appointed governess to Henry's daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary]]; the next year, when her sons were mixed up with Buckingham, she was removed, but she was restored by 1525. When Mary was declared a bastard in 1533, Margaret refused to give Mary's gold plate and jewels back to Henry. Mary's household was broken up at the end of the year, and Margaret asked to serve Mary at her own cost, but was not permitted. The Imperial Ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys]] suggested two years later that Mary be handed over to Margaret, but Henry refused, calling her \"a fool, of no experience\". When Henry's second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]], was arrested, and eventually executed, in 1536, Margaret was permitted to return to Court, albeit briefly.<ref>''ODNB''; quotation as given there.</ref>\n\n==Fall==\nIn 1531, Reginald Pole warned of the dangers of the Boleyn marriage. He returned to Padua in 1532, and received a last English benefice in December of that year. Chapuys suggested to [[Emperor Charles V]] that Reginald marry Mary and combine their dynastic claims. Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother Geoffrey. Reginald replied to books Henry sent him with his own pamphlet, ''pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione'', or ''de unitate'', which denied Henry's position on the marriage of a brother's wife and denied the royal supremacy. Reginald also urged the princes of Europe to depose Henry immediately. Henry wrote to Margaret, who in turn wrote to her son a letter reproving him for his \"folly\".<ref>ODNB, \"Reginald Pole\"; \"Geoffrey Pole\". Pole and his hagiographers gave several later accounts of Pole's activities after Henry met Anne Boleyn. These are not consistent; and if\u2014as he claimed at one point\u2014Pole rejected the Divorce in 1526 and refused the Oath of Supremacy in 1531, he received benefits from Henry for a course of action for which others were sentenced to death.</ref> In May 1536, Reginald finally and definitively broke with the king. \n\nIn 1537, Reginald (still not ordained) was created a Cardinal. [[Pope Paul III]] put him in charge of organising assistance for the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] (and related movements), an effort to organise a march on London to install a conservative Catholic government instead of Henry's increasingly Protestant-leaning one. Neither [[Francis I of France]] nor the Emperor supported this effort, and the English government tried to have him assassinated. In 1539, Reginald was sent to the Emperor to organise an [[embargo]] against England\u2014the sort of countermeasure he had himself warned Henry was possible.<ref>''ODNB'', Reginald Pole.</ref>\n\nAs part of the investigations into the so-called [[Exeter Conspiracy]], Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald, and the investigation of [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter]] (Henry VIII's first cousin and Geoffrey's second cousin) had turned up his name. Geoffrey had appealed to [[Thomas Cromwell]], who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Geoffrey said that his eldest brother, Lord Montagu, and the Marquess had been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, and Margaret were arrested in November 1538.\n\nIn January 1539, Geoffrey was pardoned, but Margaret's son Henry, Baron Montagu (and cousin Exeter) were later executed for treason after trial. In May 1539, Henry, Margaret, Exeter and others were attainted, as Margaret's father had been. This conviction meant they lost their titles and their lands\u2014mostly in the South of England, conveniently located to assist any invasion. As part of the evidence for the bill of attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, symbolising Margaret's support for Catholicism and the rule of her son Reginald and the king's Catholic daughter Mary. The supposed discovery, six months after her house and effects were searched at her arrest, is likely to have been a fabrication. She was sentenced to death, and could be executed at the king's will.\n\nMargaret Pole, as she now was styled, was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years. She, her grandson Henry (son of her own son Henry), and Exeter's son were held together and supported by the king. She was attended by servants and received an extensive grant of clothing in March 1541. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was attainted and executed.\n\n==Execution==\n{{Infobox saint\n|name=''Blessed'' Margaret Pole\n|venerated_in=[[Catholic Church]]\n|beatified_date=29 December 1886\n|beatified_by=[[Pope Leo XIII]]\n|feast_day=28 May (ordinarily, her feast day would coincide with the day of her martyrdom, however 27 May was already in use as the Feast of Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]])\n}}\n\nThe following poem was found carved on the wall of her cell:\n{{poemquote|For traitors on the block should die;\nI am no traitor, no, not I!\nMy faithfulness stands fast and so,\nTowards the block I shall not go!\nNor make one step, as you shall see;\nChrist in Thy Mercy, save Thou me!<ref>{{cite web|title=The Execution of Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury |url=http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/the-execution-of-margaret-pole-countess-of-salisbury/5592/|publisher=The Anne Bolyn Files|accessdate=12 June 2011|date=2010-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Tower of London|url=http://travellinghistorian.com/towa.html|publisher=The Travelling Historian|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 May 1541, Margaret was told she was to die within the hour. She answered that no crime had been imputed to her. Nevertheless, she was taken from her cell to the place within the precincts of the Tower of London where a low wooden block had been prepared instead of the customary scaffold.<ref name=Catholic>{{Catholic|wstitle=Blessed Margaret Pole|inline=1}}</ref> As she was of noble birth, she was not executed before the populace. Two written reports survive of her execution, both being eyewitnesses: by Marillac, the French ambassador; and by Chapuys, ambassador to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Their accounts differ slightly, with Marillac's report, dispatched two days afterwards, recording that the execution took place in a corner of the Tower with so few people present that in the evening news of her execution was doubted.  Chapuys wrote two weeks after the execution that 150 witnesses had been present including the Lord Mayor of London.  He wrote that, \"at first, when the sentence of death was made known to her, she found the thing very strange, not knowing of what crime she was accused, nor how she had been sentenced\" and that, because the main executioner<ref>This was not, as some say, Cratwell, who had himself been executed three years earlier</ref> had been sent north to deal with rebels, the execution was performed by \"a wretched and blundering youth who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner\". An apocryphal account, described in [[The Complete Peerage|Burke's Peerage]] as an invention to explain the appalling circumstances of her death, states that Margaret refused to lay her head on the block, declaiming, \"So should traitors do, and I am none\"; according to the account, she turned her head \"every which way\", instructing the executioner that, if he wanted her head, he should take it as he could.<ref>{{harvnb|Pierce|1996|pages=314\u2013315}}</ref><ref>''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', v.

She was the daughter of [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]], the brother of kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. Margaret was one of two women in 16th-century England to be a peeress in her own right with no titled husband.<ref>''ODNB''; the other was [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Marquess of Pembroke]]. The ''ODNB'' does not qualify the assertion, but is discussing sixteenth-century usage; sources which apply modern law retroactively will consider some women peeresses in their own right when their husbands sat in Parliament with their father's style and precedence.</ref> One of the few surviving members of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]] after the [[Wars of the Roses]], she was executed in 1541 at the command of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who was the son of her first cousin [[Elizabeth of York]]. [[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] her as a martyr for the [[Catholic Church]] on 29 December 1886.<ref>DWYER, J. G. \"Pole, Margaret Plantagenet, Bl.\" ''New Catholic Encyclopedia.'' 2nd ed. Vol. 11. Detroit: Gale, 2003. pp. 455\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMargaret was born at [[Farleigh Hungerford Castle]] in Somerset, the only surviving daughter of [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and his wife [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel Neville]], who was the elder daughter of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], and his wife [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick|Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick]]. Her maternal grandfather was killed fighting against her uncle, [[Edward IV]], at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. Her father, already Duke of Clarence, was then created Earl of Salisbury and of Warwick. Edward IV declared that Margaret's younger brother [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward]] should be known as [[Earl of Warwick]] as a courtesy title, but no peerage was ever created for him. Margaret would have had a claim to the Earldom of Warwick, but the earldom was forfeited on the [[attainder]] of her brother Edward.<ref name=\"ODNB\">''ODNB''.</ref>\n\nMargaret's mother died when she was three, and her father had two servants killed whom he thought had poisoned her. George plotted against Edward IV, and was attainted and executed for treason; his lands and titles were forfeited. Edward IV died when Margaret was ten, and her uncle [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], declared that Edward's marriage was invalid, his children illegitimate, and that Margaret and her brother Edward were debarred from the throne by their father's attainder. Married to [[Anne Neville]], younger sister to Margaret's mother Isabel, Richard assumed the throne himself as Richard III.\n\nRichard III sent the children to [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] in Yorkshire. He was defeated and killed in 1485 at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] by Henry Tudor, who succeeded him as [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. The new king married Margaret's cousin [[Elizabeth of York]], Edward IV's daughter, and Margaret and her brother were taken into their care. Soon young Edward, a potential [[House of York|York]] claimant to the throne, was moved to the [[Tower of London]]. Edward was briefly displayed in public at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1487 in response to the presentation of the impostor [[Lambert Simnel]] as the \"Earl of Warwick\" to the Irish lords. Shortly thereafter, probably in November 1487, Henry VII gave Margaret in marriage to his cousin, [[Sir Richard Pole]], whose mother was half-sister of the king's mother, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]].<ref name=Catholic/> When [[Perkin Warbeck]] impersonated Edward IV's presumed-dead son [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York]], in 1499, Margaret's brother Edward was attainted and executed for involvement in the plot. Richard Pole held a variety of offices in Henry VII's government, the highest being Chamberlain for [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], Henry's elder son. When Arthur married [[Catherine of Aragon]], Margaret became one of her [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], but her entourage was dissolved when the teenaged Arthur died in 1502.\n\nWhen her husband died in 1505, Margaret was a widow with five children, a limited amount of land inherited from her husband, no other income and no prospects. Henry VII paid for Richard's funeral. To ease the situation, Margaret devoted her third son [[Reginald Pole]] to the Church, where he was to have an eventful career as a papal Legate and later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Nonetheless, he was to resent her abandonment of him bitterly in later life.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>  Additionally, Margaret, without adequate means to support herself and her children, was forced to live at [[Syon Monastery|Syon Abbey]] among Bridgettine nuns after her husband's death.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Margaret Pole and Syon abbey|last = Powell|first = Sue|date = 1 November 2005|journal = Historical Research |volume = 78|issue = 202|pages = 563\u2013567|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2281.2005.00254.x|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> She was to remain there until she returned to favour at the ascension of [[Henry VIII]] in 1509.\n\n==Countess of Salisbury==\nWhen Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509, he married Catherine of Aragon himself. Margaret was again appointed one of her ladies-in-waiting. In 1512, Parliament restored to her some of her brother's lands of the earldom of Salisbury (only), for which she paid 5000 marks (\u00a32666.13s.4d). Henry VII had controlled them, first during her brother's minority and then during his imprisonment, and had confiscated them after his trial. The same Act also restored to Margaret the Earldom of Salisbury.<ref>ODNB, which argues that the restoration was a tacit admission of her brother's innocence; however, lands and titles had been restored to the heirs of guilty peers during the previous century.</ref> The Warwick and Spencer [Despencer] lands remained crown property.<ref>TNA, minsters' accounts, SC6/HENVIII.</ref>\n\nAs Countess of Salisbury, Margaret managed her lands well, and by 1538, she was the fifth richest peer in England. She was a patron of the [[new learning]], like many Renaissance nobles; [[Gentian Hervet]] translated [[Erasmus]]' ''de immensa misericordia Dei'' (''The Great Mercy of God'') into English for her. Her first son, [[Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu|Henry Pole]], was created [[Baron Montagu]], another of the Neville titles; he spoke for the family in the House of Lords. Her second son, [[Arthur Pole (1499\u20131532)|Arthur Pole]], had a generally successful career as a courtier, becoming one of the six Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. He suffered a setback when his patron [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], was convicted of treason in 1521, but he was soon restored to favour. He died young about 1526, having married the heir of Roger Lewknor; the Countess and her son Henry pressed Arthur's widow to a vow of perpetual chastity to preserve her inheritance for her Pole children. Margaret's daughter [[Ursula Pole, Baroness Stafford|Ursula]] married the Duke of Buckingham's son, [[Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford|Henry Stafford]], but after the Duke's fall, the couple was given only fragments of his estates.\n\nMargaret's third son, [[Reginald Pole]], studied abroad in Padua; he was dean in Exeter and Wimborne Minster, Dorset as well as canon in York. He had several other livings, although he had not been ordained a priest. He represented Henry VIII in Paris in 1529, persuading the theologians of the [[Sorbonne]] to support Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon.<ref>ODNB, Reginald Pole</ref> Her youngest son [[Geoffrey Pole]] married well, to Constance, daughter of Edmund Pakenham, and inherited the estate of [[Lordington House|Lordington]] in Sussex.\n\nMargaret's own favour at Court varied. She had a dispute over land with Henry VIII in 1518; he awarded the contested lands to the [[Dukedom of Somerset]], which had been held by his Beaufort grandfather\u2014and were now in the possession of the Crown. In 1520, Margaret was appointed governess to Henry's daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary]]; the next year, when her sons were mixed up with Buckingham, she was removed, but she was restored by 1525. When Mary was declared a bastard in 1533, Margaret refused to give Mary's gold plate and jewels back to Henry. Mary's household was broken up at the end of the year, and Margaret asked to serve Mary at her own cost, but was not permitted. The Imperial Ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys]] suggested two years later that Mary be handed over to Margaret, but Henry refused, calling her \"a fool, of no experience\". When Henry's second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]], was arrested, and eventually executed, in 1536, Margaret was permitted to return to Court, albeit briefly.<ref>''ODNB''; quotation as given there.</ref>\n\n==Fall==\nIn 1531, Reginald Pole warned of the dangers of the Boleyn marriage. He returned to Padua in 1532, and received a last English benefice in December of that year. Chapuys suggested to [[Emperor Charles V]] that Reginald marry Mary and combine their dynastic claims. Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother Geoffrey. Reginald replied to books Henry sent him with his own pamphlet, ''pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione'', or ''de unitate'', which denied Henry's position on the marriage of a brother's wife and denied the royal supremacy. Reginald also urged the princes of Europe to depose Henry immediately. Henry wrote to Margaret, who in turn wrote to her son a letter reproving him for his \"folly\".<ref>ODNB, \"Reginald Pole\"; \"Geoffrey Pole\". Pole and his hagiographers gave several later accounts of Pole's activities after Henry met Anne Boleyn. These are not consistent; and if\u2014as he claimed at one point\u2014Pole rejected the Divorce in 1526 and refused the Oath of Supremacy in 1531, he received benefits from Henry for a course of action for which others were sentenced to death.</ref> In May 1536, Reginald finally and definitively broke with the king. \n\nIn 1537, Reginald (still not ordained) was created a Cardinal. [[Pope Paul III]] put him in charge of organising assistance for the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] (and related movements), an effort to organise a march on London to install a conservative Catholic government instead of Henry's increasingly Protestant-leaning one. Neither [[Francis I of France]] nor the Emperor supported this effort, and the English government tried to have him assassinated. In 1539, Reginald was sent to the Emperor to organise an [[embargo]] against England\u2014the sort of countermeasure he had himself warned Henry was possible.<ref>''ODNB'', Reginald Pole.</ref>\n\nAs part of the investigations into the so-called [[Exeter Conspiracy]], Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald, and the investigation of [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter]] (Henry VIII's first cousin and Geoffrey's second cousin) had turned up his name. Geoffrey had appealed to [[Thomas Cromwell]], who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Geoffrey said that his eldest brother, Lord Montagu, and the Marquess had been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, and Margaret were arrested in November 1538.\n\nIn January 1539, Geoffrey was pardoned, but Margaret's son Henry, Baron Montagu (and cousin Exeter) were later executed for treason after trial. In May 1539, Henry, Margaret, Exeter and others were attainted, as Margaret's father had been. This conviction meant they lost their titles and their lands\u2014mostly in the South of England, conveniently located to assist any invasion. As part of the evidence for the bill of attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, symbolising Margaret's support for Catholicism and the rule of her son Reginald and the king's Catholic daughter Mary. The supposed discovery, six months after her house and effects were searched at her arrest, is likely to have been a fabrication. She was sentenced to death, and could be executed at the king's will.\n\nMargaret Pole, as she now was styled, was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years. She, her grandson Henry (son of her own son Henry), and Exeter's son were held together and supported by the king. She was attended by servants and received an extensive grant of clothing in March 1541. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was attainted and executed.\n\n==Execution==\n{{Infobox saint\n|name=''Blessed'' Margaret Pole\n|venerated_in=[[Catholic Church]]\n|beatified_date=29 December 1886\n|beatified_by=[[Pope Leo XIII]]\n|feast_day=28 May (ordinarily, her feast day would coincide with the day of her martyrdom, however 27 May was already in use as the Feast of Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]])\n}}\n\nThe following poem was found carved on the wall of her cell:\n{{poemquote|For traitors on the block should die;\nI am no traitor, no, not I!\nMy faithfulness stands fast and so,\nTowards the block I shall not go!\nNor make one step, as you shall see;\nChrist in Thy Mercy, save Thou me!<ref>{{cite web|title=The Execution of Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury |url=http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/the-execution-of-margaret-pole-countess-of-salisbury/5592/|publisher=The Anne Bolyn Files|accessdate=12 June 2011|date=2010-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Tower of London|url=http://travellinghistorian.com/towa.html|publisher=The Travelling Historian|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 May 1541, Margaret was told she was to die within the hour. She answered that no crime had been imputed to her. Nevertheless, she was taken from her cell to the place within the precincts of the Tower of London where a low wooden block had been prepared instead of the customary scaffold.<ref name=Catholic>{{Catholic|wstitle=Blessed Margaret Pole|inline=1}}</ref> As she was of noble birth, she was not executed before the populace. Two written reports survive of her execution, both being eyewitnesses: by Marillac, the French ambassador; and by Chapuys, ambassador to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Their accounts differ slightly, with Marillac's report, dispatched two days afterwards, recording that the execution took place in a corner of the Tower with so few people present that in the evening news of her execution was doubted.  Chapuys wrote two weeks after the execution that 150 witnesses had been present including the Lord Mayor of London.  He wrote that, \"at first, when the sentence of death was made known to her, she found the thing very strange, not knowing of what crime she was accused, nor how she had been sentenced\" and that, because the main executioner<ref>This was not, as some say, Cratwell, who had himself been executed three years earlier</ref> had been sent north to deal with rebels, the execution was performed by \"a wretched and blundering youth who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner\". An apocryphal account, described in [[The Complete Peerage|Burke's Peerage]] as an invention to explain the appalling circumstances of her death, states that Margaret refused to lay her head on the block, declaiming, \"So should traitors do, and I am none\"; according to the account, she turned her head \"every which way\", instructing the executioner that, if he wanted her head, he should take it as he could.<ref>{{harvnb|Pierce|1996|pages=314\u2013315}}</ref><ref>''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', v.

There were a few films that featured Singaporean actors and were set in Singapore, including ''[[Saint Jack (film)|Saint Jack]]'', ''[[They Call Her Cleopatra Wong]]'' and ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]''.<ref>[http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20061216053138/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/ac-ca/progs/rc-tr/progs/eccc-ttcc/market/publications/singapour_film_market/film_singapour_e.pdf Singapore Film Market] </ref>\n\nWith the increasing global success and globalization of the Singaporean film industry, the past two decades have seen Singaporean actors like [[Christopher Lee]], [[Tan Kheng Hua]] and [[Fiona Xie]] star in [[Hollywood]] films, Singaporean auteurs such as [[Jack Neo]] direct English-language works and Singaporean films be remade in the United States, China, Japan as well as other markets. The [[Singapore International Film Festival]] has also grown to become one of Asia's largest and most important flim festivals.\n\n==After 1990==\n\n===Early 1990s pioneers===\nThe first fully Singapore funded film came in 1991's ''[[The Medium (1992 film)|Medium Rare]]'', which was based on a real-life local cult killer, Adrian Lim, who was hanged in 1988 for murder.  Although it cost over S$2 million in production, the film performed dismally at the box office.  The film took in merely S$130,000 locally but broke the ice for the next coming Singapore movie, ''[[Bugis Street]]'', which was released in 1995.  ''Bugis Street'' was a gaudy film about the famous sleazy district where [[transvestism|transvestites]] and [[transsexual]]s were found. Both Medium Rare and Bugis Street were directed by Singaporeans. The same year saw the release of ''[[Mee Pok Man]]'', the first full-length film made by an independent Singaporean filmmaker, [[Eric Khoo]], on a tight budget of S$100,000.  Concerning a lonely noodle seller who falls for a [[prostitute]], ''Mee Pok Man'' earned much critical accolade worldwide and encouraged more experimental, independent filmmaking in the nation.\n\n''[[Army Daze]]'', made in 1996, took a humorous look at Singapore's [[national service]], and turned in high profits at the box office.\n\nIn 1997 came another Eric Khoo feature film, ''[[12 Storeys]]'', a highly acclaimed production which was the first Singaporean film to be shown at [[Cannes]].  Interweaving 3 stories about life in the [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] high-rise flats, ''12 Storeys'' was seen as a breakthrough for Singaporean films, combining a coherent plot with Singaporean production crew and actors, such as [[Jack Neo]] and Koh Boon Pin.  The rest of the decade was encouraging for the growing film industry.  [[Glen Goei]]'s ''Forever Fever'' (1998) was picked up by [[Miramax]] for S$4.5 million and re-released in the [[United States|U.S.]] as ''That's the Way I Like It''.  These two years saw the releases of a number of other films, such as ''A Road Less Travelled'' (1997), ''God or Dog'' (1997), ''Tiger's Whip'' (1998) and ''[[The Teenage Textbook Movie]]'' (1998).\n\n===Late 1990s successes===\nHowever, it was the phenomenal success of ''[[Money No Enough]]'' (1998) which eventually catapulted the nation's drive towards movie-making.  Using a local crew of actors drawn from television comedies, this 'heartland' comedy written by Jack Neo used a smattering of [[Singlish]] and [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] to make a realistic, easily identifiable drama about everybody's quest to make a quick buck.  Made with less than S$1 million, it raked in S$5,800,000, making it the most commercially profitable local film to date.  It also demonstrated the viable potential of Singapore's film industry. The next year would be a boom year for local films.  Eight Singaporean feature films were made in 1999 alone, the most notable being ''[[Liang Po Po: The Movie]]'' (starring Jack Neo in a reprisal of his television cross-gender role), ''That One No Enough'', the first directorial effect of Jack Neo, and ''Eating Air'', made by film critic [[Kelvin Tong]] and film editor Jasmine Ng on a budget of S$800,000.  ''Eating Air'' did not break even; ''That One No Enough'' barely did and only ''Liang Po Po: The Movie'' continued the vein of commercial success of ''Money No Enough'', collecting S$3.03 million. \n{{Life in Singapore}}\n1999 also marked a watershed for Singapore films.  [[Raintree Pictures]], the filmmaking subsidiary of [[MediaCorp|MediaCorp Productions]], was started. Raintree Pictures invested in two regional co-productions, ''Liang Po Po'' and ''[[The Truth About Jane and Sam]]'', which starred Singaporean television lead actress [[Fann Wong]] with [[Taiwan]]ese singer [[Peter Ho]] and [[Hong Kong]] director [[Derek Yee]].  Raintree Pictures would finance a number of local and Hong Kong productions in years to come, and are the producer company of the films of Jack Neo.  Subsequent productions, such as ''[[2000 AD (film)|2000 AD]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Tree (2001 film)|The Tree]]'' (2001), also drew on Hong Kong star power; the company invested in critically acclaimed regional films such as ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002) and ''Infernal Affairs II'' (2003).  Raintree Pictures also produced two English-language local productions, ''[[Chicken Rice War]]'' (2000) and ''[[One Leg Kicking]]'' (2001).\n\nWith the financing of a local production company and the setting up of organisations such as the Singapore Film Commission (SFC, set up in 1998), budding filmmakers, especially independent ones, found it easier to make movies on subsidies and loaned funding.  The advent of [[digital video]] also meant that some novice filmmakers could experiment with cheaper alternatives.  Features like ''Stories about Love'' (2000) and ''Return to Pontianak'' (2001) were both shot on digital videos, even though they were not commercial successes.\n\n===Early 2000s===\nThe success story since the turn of the 21st century must be from local comedian-turned-director Jack Neo.  Financed by Raintree Pictures, he made a number of hits dealing with Singapore's heartland problems in an engaging and deceptively light-hearted fashion.  ''[[I Not Stupid]]'' (2002) was a peek into the ultra-competitive academic lifestyle as seen through three local students who performed poorly in grades; its acerbic social commentary marked another height for Singaporean films. ''[[Homerun (film)|Homerun]]'' (2003) was a remake of the Iranian ''[[Children of Heaven]]'' in a local, pre-independent era context; it won for its young lead [[Megan Zheng]] the first [[Golden Horse Award]] for Best Newcomer.  ''[[The Best Bet]]'' (2004) took a humorous dig at heartlanders' obsessions with lotteries.  Neo averages a film per year and his productions feature local Singaporean (usually television) artistes in filmic roles.  They have been successes locally and abroad, especially in those places with a Chinese-language market, such as Hong Kong.  He has started his own artiste management company, J-Team Productions.\n\n[[Royston Tan]], a young Singapore TV commercial director who has been making award-winning shorts for years, released ''[[15 (film)|15: The Movie]]'', his first feature, in 2003.  An expanded version of an earlier short film he made, this 90-min movie on the fringe and drug-abusing delinquents used bold subject-matter and featured some graphic scenes with non-professional actors.  When the film censorship board passed it with cuts, it prompted a backlash from the director in the form of ''Cut'', an all-singing musical satire ''\u00e0 la'' [[Tsai Ming-liang]] lampooning the system.  This short film was passed uncensored by the board and was seen during the [[Singapore International Film Festival]], but there were open discussions about it during local parliamentary sessions, prompting remarks that the government was \"not amused\" by it.  Royston Tan has since made three more features, ''4:30'' (2005), ''881'' (2007) and ''12 Lotus'' (2008).\n\n===2005 to 2009===\n2005 could be seen as another mini-boom year for Singaporean cinema, with commercially successful fares like [[Kelvin Tong]]'s horror flick ''[[The Maid (2005 film)|The Maid]]'', two Jack-Neo co-directed movies, ''I Do I Do'' and ''One More Chance'', and less mainstream offerings like [[Eric Khoo]]'s critically acclaimed [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] opener ''[[Be with Me]]'', and ''[[Perth (film)|Perth]]'', Djinn's dark take on [[Martin Scorsese|Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.\n\nIn 2006, the independent feature ''[[Becoming Royston]]'' paid homage to the above-mentioned filmmaker.  It was made under new Originasian Pictures. The film went on its festival run in Europe and South Asia and was released in 2007. 2006 also saw the premiere of ''[[Singapore Dreaming]]'' by [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103050039/http://www.colinandyenyen.com/ Woo Yen Yen and Colin Goh], who won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, the first Singaporeans to do so. The film was also screened at numerous festivals worldwide and, in 2007, became the first Singaporean feature to win the Audience Award for Narrative Feature at the Asian American International Film Festival in New York.\n\nIn 2007, Jack Neo released another film known as ''[[Just Follow Law]]'' which took a dig at bureaucracy in the civil service, as well as the lengthy procedures one had to go through in Singapore to get a permit for various things. This film garnered generally positive reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. However, the success story of the year was Royston Tan's ''[[881 (film)|881]]'', which brought Singapore's seventh month [[getai]] culture to the big screens. While it was intended to be a niche film, it exceeded expectations and became one of the highest-grossing local films of all time. Critics generally gave it positive reviews, and many believe that it was the fact that the film gave younger Singaporean Chinese more insight into their traditional culture that made it a success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In addition, the use of Hokkien songs, which had been suppressed by the government as part of the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]], may have contributed to its popularity.\n\nIn 2008, Eric Khoo's [[Tamil language]] social drama ''[[My Magic]]'' became Singapore's first film to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n===2010 and beyond===\nA wave of young filmmakers, considered the Singaporean new wave, who are educated in local and overseas film schools, begin to dominate the film scene.\n\n''[[Ilo Ilo]]'', the debut feature of director [[Anthony Chen]], premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] on 19 May 2013 to very positive reviews.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ilo-ilo-cannes-review-525336 |title=Ilo Ilo: Cannes Review |accessdate=22 June 2013 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=5 May 2013}}</ref> The film was awarded the [[Camera d'Or]] award, thus becoming the first Singaporean [[feature film]] to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival.<ref name=\"today20130527\">{{cite web |first=Genevieve |last=Loh |url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/movies/ilo-ilo-first-spore-film-win-cannes |title=Ilo Ilo is first S\u2019pore film to win at Cannes |accessdate=22 June 2013 |work=Today |date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527025633/http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/movies/ilo-ilo-first-spore-film-win-cannes |archivedate=27 May 2013 }}</ref> It received six nominations at the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]].,<ref>{{cite news|title=\u2018Ilo Ilo\u2019 earns 6 nominations for the Golden Horse Awards|url=http://sg.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/show-buzz/ilo-ilo-earns-6-nominations-golden-horse-awards-150549059.html|publisher=Yahoo!

These two years saw the releases of a number of other films, such as ''A Road Less Travelled'' (1997), ''God or Dog'' (1997), ''Tiger's Whip'' (1998) and ''[[The Teenage Textbook Movie]]'' (1998).\n\n===Late 1990s successes===\nHowever, it was the phenomenal success of ''[[Money No Enough]]'' (1998) which eventually catapulted the nation's drive towards movie-making.  Using a local crew of actors drawn from television comedies, this 'heartland' comedy written by Jack Neo used a smattering of [[Singlish]] and [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] to make a realistic, easily identifiable drama about everybody's quest to make a quick buck.  Made with less than S$1 million, it raked in S$5,800,000, making it the most commercially profitable local film to date.  It also demonstrated the viable potential of Singapore's film industry. The next year would be a boom year for local films.  Eight Singaporean feature films were made in 1999 alone, the most notable being ''[[Liang Po Po: The Movie]]'' (starring Jack Neo in a reprisal of his television cross-gender role), ''That One No Enough'', the first directorial effect of Jack Neo, and ''Eating Air'', made by film critic [[Kelvin Tong]] and film editor Jasmine Ng on a budget of S$800,000.  ''Eating Air'' did not break even; ''That One No Enough'' barely did and only ''Liang Po Po: The Movie'' continued the vein of commercial success of ''Money No Enough'', collecting S$3.03 million. \n{{Life in Singapore}}\n1999 also marked a watershed for Singapore films.  [[Raintree Pictures]], the filmmaking subsidiary of [[MediaCorp|MediaCorp Productions]], was started. Raintree Pictures invested in two regional co-productions, ''Liang Po Po'' and ''[[The Truth About Jane and Sam]]'', which starred Singaporean television lead actress [[Fann Wong]] with [[Taiwan]]ese singer [[Peter Ho]] and [[Hong Kong]] director [[Derek Yee]].  Raintree Pictures would finance a number of local and Hong Kong productions in years to come, and are the producer company of the films of Jack Neo.  Subsequent productions, such as ''[[2000 AD (film)|2000 AD]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Tree (2001 film)|The Tree]]'' (2001), also drew on Hong Kong star power; the company invested in critically acclaimed regional films such as ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002) and ''Infernal Affairs II'' (2003).  Raintree Pictures also produced two English-language local productions, ''[[Chicken Rice War]]'' (2000) and ''[[One Leg Kicking]]'' (2001).\n\nWith the financing of a local production company and the setting up of organisations such as the Singapore Film Commission (SFC, set up in 1998), budding filmmakers, especially independent ones, found it easier to make movies on subsidies and loaned funding.  The advent of [[digital video]] also meant that some novice filmmakers could experiment with cheaper alternatives.  Features like ''Stories about Love'' (2000) and ''Return to Pontianak'' (2001) were both shot on digital videos, even though they were not commercial successes.\n\n===Early 2000s===\nThe success story since the turn of the 21st century must be from local comedian-turned-director Jack Neo.  Financed by Raintree Pictures, he made a number of hits dealing with Singapore's heartland problems in an engaging and deceptively light-hearted fashion.  ''[[I Not Stupid]]'' (2002) was a peek into the ultra-competitive academic lifestyle as seen through three local students who performed poorly in grades; its acerbic social commentary marked another height for Singaporean films. ''[[Homerun (film)|Homerun]]'' (2003) was a remake of the Iranian ''[[Children of Heaven]]'' in a local, pre-independent era context; it won for its young lead [[Megan Zheng]] the first [[Golden Horse Award]] for Best Newcomer.  ''[[The Best Bet]]'' (2004) took a humorous dig at heartlanders' obsessions with lotteries.  Neo averages a film per year and his productions feature local Singaporean (usually television) artistes in filmic roles.  They have been successes locally and abroad, especially in those places with a Chinese-language market, such as Hong Kong.  He has started his own artiste management company, J-Team Productions.\n\n[[Royston Tan]], a young Singapore TV commercial director who has been making award-winning shorts for years, released ''[[15 (film)|15: The Movie]]'', his first feature, in 2003.  An expanded version of an earlier short film he made, this 90-min movie on the fringe and drug-abusing delinquents used bold subject-matter and featured some graphic scenes with non-professional actors.  When the film censorship board passed it with cuts, it prompted a backlash from the director in the form of ''Cut'', an all-singing musical satire ''\u00e0 la'' [[Tsai Ming-liang]] lampooning the system.  This short film was passed uncensored by the board and was seen during the [[Singapore International Film Festival]], but there were open discussions about it during local parliamentary sessions, prompting remarks that the government was \"not amused\" by it.  Royston Tan has since made three more features, ''4:30'' (2005), ''881'' (2007) and ''12 Lotus'' (2008).\n\n===2005 to 2009===\n2005 could be seen as another mini-boom year for Singaporean cinema, with commercially successful fares like [[Kelvin Tong]]'s horror flick ''[[The Maid (2005 film)|The Maid]]'', two Jack-Neo co-directed movies, ''I Do I Do'' and ''One More Chance'', and less mainstream offerings like [[Eric Khoo]]'s critically acclaimed [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] opener ''[[Be with Me]]'', and ''[[Perth (film)|Perth]]'', Djinn's dark take on [[Martin Scorsese|Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.\n\nIn 2006, the independent feature ''[[Becoming Royston]]'' paid homage to the above-mentioned filmmaker.  It was made under new Originasian Pictures. The film went on its festival run in Europe and South Asia and was released in 2007. 2006 also saw the premiere of ''[[Singapore Dreaming]]'' by [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103050039/http://www.colinandyenyen.com/ Woo Yen Yen and Colin Goh], who won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, the first Singaporeans to do so. The film was also screened at numerous festivals worldwide and, in 2007, became the first Singaporean feature to win the Audience Award for Narrative Feature at the Asian American International Film Festival in New York.\n\nIn 2007, Jack Neo released another film known as ''[[Just Follow Law]]'' which took a dig at bureaucracy in the civil service, as well as the lengthy procedures one had to go through in Singapore to get a permit for various things. This film garnered generally positive reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. However, the success story of the year was Royston Tan's ''[[881 (film)|881]]'', which brought Singapore's seventh month [[getai]] culture to the big screens. While it was intended to be a niche film, it exceeded expectations and became one of the highest-grossing local films of all time. Critics generally gave it positive reviews, and many believe that it was the fact that the film gave younger Singaporean Chinese more insight into their traditional culture that made it a success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In addition, the use of Hokkien songs, which had been suppressed by the government as part of the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]], may have contributed to its popularity.\n\nIn 2008, Eric Khoo's [[Tamil language]] social drama ''[[My Magic]]'' became Singapore's first film to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n===2010 and beyond===\nA wave of young filmmakers, considered the Singaporean new wave, who are educated in local and overseas film schools, begin to dominate the film scene.\n\n''[[Ilo Ilo]]'' (Chinese: \u7238\u5988\u4e0d\u5728\u5bb6), the debut feature of director [[Anthony Chen]], premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] on 19 May 2013 to very positive reviews.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ilo-ilo-cannes-review-525336 |title=Ilo Ilo: Cannes Review |accessdate=22 June 2013 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=5 May 2013}}</ref> The film was awarded the [[Camera d'Or]] award, thus becoming the first Singaporean [[feature film]] to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival.<ref name=\"today20130527\">{{cite web |first=Genevieve |last=Loh |url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/movies/ilo-ilo-first-spore-film-win-cannes |title=Ilo Ilo is first S\u2019pore film to win at Cannes |accessdate=22 June 2013 |work=Today |date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527025633/http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/movies/ilo-ilo-first-spore-film-win-cannes |archivedate=27 May 2013 }}</ref> It received six nominations at the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]].,<ref>{{cite news|title=\u2018Ilo Ilo\u2019 earns 6 nominations for the Golden Horse Awards|url=http://sg.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/show-buzz/ilo-ilo-earns-6-nominations-golden-horse-awards-150549059.html|publisher=Yahoo!

PLEASE DISCUSS IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE IT-->\nThe '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was fought primarily between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and her [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America, resulting in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the [[United States of America]].{{efn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as \"Americans\", with occasional references to \"Patriots\" or \"Revolutionaries\". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing political differences concering colonial representaion in Parliament strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies and fueled the resentment that led to the [[American Revolution]]. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against taxation without [[No taxation without representation|representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroying a shipment of tea in [[Boston Tea Party|Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing the harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]]{{efn|[[Province of Georgia|The colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later.}} to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress unanimously appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate  [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n                                           \nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]]; by the end of September 1779, Spanish troops had cleared all British forts and settlers located in the entire region along the Mississippi.<!--<ref>[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy, 2013]], p. 179</ref>--> The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] and Washington then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis' army]] and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n                                           \n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America, but the war continued against France and Spain in Europe, the Caribbean and India. Britain successfully resisted Spain's [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|attempt to seize Gibraltar]] and scored a [[Battle of the Saintes|major victory]] over the French navy in the Caribbean. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.\n{{toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n            \n=== Taxation disputes ===\nParliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] and for the war itself. The colonists resented that they had to pay for a war that they fought in and had sacrificed many lives for. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of the British Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their jurisdictions.<ref>[[#bonwick|Bonwick, 1991]], pp. 71\u201372</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>[[#gladney|Gladney, 2014]], p. 5</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">[[#dickinson1977|Dickinson, 1977]], p. 218</ref> Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.<ref>[[#McIlwain|McIlwain, 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;[1938] ]], p. 51</ref> From 1767, Parliament began passing the [[Townshend Acts]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty, imposing taxes on imported goods such as tea, lead, glass, paper, items required by law to be purchased exclusively from Britain, while establishing the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. A [[Board of Customs]] was also created in Boston to enforce the Acts, while the New York Assembly was suspended, all of which fueled increasing resentment and widespread opposition among the colonists.<ref>[[#boyer|Boyer, 2014]], p. 142</ref><ref>Knollenberg, Growth, 48; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 76</ref><ref>[[#ferling2002|Ferling, 2002]], pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.<ref>[[#young|Young, 1999]], pp. 183\u201385</ref>]]\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The seizure of the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England.<ref>Knollenberg, Growth, 69</ref> Tensions rose after the murder of eleven year old [[Christopher Seider]] by a customs official in 1770, and escalated into further outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]]. Many of the colonists suspected that the incident was intentionally provoked and used as a pretext by royal officials to crush the rebellion by force.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], p.23</ref> In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|governor of Massachusetts]] permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor, so the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests in what became known as the \"Boston Tea Party\".<ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], p. 155\u2013156</ref>\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation. It [[Boston Port Act|closed Boston Harbor]] until the tea was paid for and [[Massachusetts Government Act|revoked]] the [[Massachusetts Charter]], taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]]. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.<ref>[[#yale'mga|Avalon Project, 2008, Massachusetts Government Act]]</ref><ref>[[#christie|Christie, 1976]], p. 188</ref> [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Further measures]] allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime, the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade, and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that outweighed the initial disadvantages which they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended on local production of food and most supplies rather than on imports, while British supplies were mostly shipped from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports; the British could capture any port, but that did not give them control over the inland areas. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communication. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Indians, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias and provide a training ground for the national army.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], ch. 36\u201339</ref> Motivation was also a major asset. The Patriots had much more popular support than the Loyalists, and more than 200,000 Americans fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Lanning195\u201396\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them militarily.

Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home, were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare, but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\" />\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775 and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers and navy it had sent, which assisted him greatly in defeating Cornwallis during the surrender of Yorktown in 1781.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], pp. 203, 303, 391</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost more battles than he won, but never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2007]], pp. 258-261</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged with selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name=gardner3/><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p. 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref> Owing to the precarious nature of the committee process, Congress created the post of Secretary of War which replaced the Board of War and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] as its first secretary in February, 1781. Washington worked closely with Lincoln in organizing the relationship between civilian and military authorities.<ref name=gardner3/>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. He transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp. 429\u201336.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990) p. 220.</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Edward G. Lengel, ''General George Washington: A Military Life'' (2005) pp. 365\u201371.</ref>\n\n==== Intelligence and espionage ====\n{{Main|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War&nbsp;|&nbsp;Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War}}\n\nAt the onset of the war the [[Second Continental Congress]] soon realized that they would need foreign alliances and intelligence gathering capability to defeat a world power like Britain. To this end they formed the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]], which operated from 1775-1776, for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\".  Through secret correspondence the Committee forged alliances and shared information with persons in France, England and within America. The Committee employed secret agents in Europe to gather foreign intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications and to initiate American propaganda campaigns to gain patriot support.<ref name=cia2011>[[#cia|CIA, 2011, Historical Document]]</ref> Some notable members of the Committee included [[Thomas Paine]], the Committee's secretary, and [[Silas Deane]] who was sent undercover to France and was instrumental in securing her aid.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;[2006] ]], p. 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Culper Ring code.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Page from Culper Ring's code book, with names adjacent to their code numbers]]\n\nAfter the British were driven out of Boston during the [[Seige of Boston]] they redeployed in Nova Scotia. Washington anticipating that they would soon attack New York City, departed Boston on April 4 with his army and headed for Manhattan and began constructing fortifications [[Heights of Guan|about the harbor]]. Realizing he needed advance information to best deal with the British, Washington on August 12, 1776, selected and promoted [[Thomas Knowlton]] to lieutenant colonel with orders to select an elite group of 130 men and 20 officers, which came to be known as [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the Army's first intelligence unit. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and other secret missions that were considered too dangerous for regular troops. Knowlton was killed in action on September 17, at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] while on a mission observing British troop activity.<ref>[[#johnston1897|Johnston, 1897]], p. 61</ref>Among the Rangers was the young [[Nathan Hale]].<ref name=cia2011/><ref>[[#kilmeade|Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2013]], pp. 20-22</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the British landed on Long Island with overwhelming force during the [[Battle of Long Island]] and forced Washington to retreat across the East River to New York City, on Manhattan Island{{efn|The city in 1776 only occupied the southern tip of Manhattan.}} Washington knew a British attack on city was imminent. Desperate to learn when and where the attack would occur he asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn. No one came forward, except for the 21 year old Nathan Hale, who, however, only provided  nominal intelligence to Washington. Soon after the British attack occurred on September 15, Hale was recognized in a tavern by a Loyalist shop keeper, was apprehended, found with sketches of British fortifications and troop positions in his pockets, and was ordered by Howe to be summarily hanged, the next day, without trial, on September 22.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], p. 134</ref> After Washington was driven out of New York he realized firsthand that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British. Subsequently he enlisted the aid of [[Benjamin Tallmadge]], and together they created the [[Culper Ring|Culper spy ring]], consisting of six leading men.{{efn|Tallmadge, whose cover name became John Bolton, was the architech of the spy ring.<ref name=baker12/> }} Washington promised members of the ring that their identities and activities would never be revealed.{{efn|Four of their names were revealed in the 1920's, through the research of archivist [[Morton Pennypacker]].

Stewart, ed., ''American Military History Volume 1 The United States Army And The Forging Of A Nation, 1775\u20131917\" (2005)] ch 4  \"The Winning of Independence, 1777\u20131783\" (2005), p. 103.</ref>\n\n===== William Howe =====\n[[File:WilliamHowe1777ColorMezzotint.jpeg|thumb|left|A 1777 mezzotint of Sir William Howe, British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief]] from 1775\u20131778]]\n\nHistorians such as Ellis and Stewart have observed that, under William Howe's command, the British squandered several opportunities to achieve a decisive victory over the Americans.<ref name=\"Richard W. Stewart 2005 p. 103\" /><ref name=\"Ellis 2013\" /> Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory.  After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.<ref name=\"Ridpath 1915\" /><ref name=\"auto\" /><ref name=\"Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221\" /> Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause<ref name=\"Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142\">Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref> and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,<ref name=\"American History 1982 p. 130\" /> Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.<ref name=\"Lecky, William 1891 p. 57\" />\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]]. At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H. Kennedy 2014 163\" />\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive maneuvers by the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.<ref>Frothingham pp. 152\u201353</ref><ref>Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005). Empire City: New York Through the Centuries. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231109093}}, p. 20</ref> During the major campaigns in New York and Philadelphia, Howe often wrote of the scarcity of adequate provisions, which hampered his ability to mount effective campaigns.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:93, Howe to Dartmouth, December 1, 1775</ref>  Howe's tardiness in launching the New York campaign, and his reluctance to allow Cornwallis to vigorously pursue Washington's beaten army, have both been attributed to the paucity of available food supplies.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, June 7 and July 7, 1776</ref><ref>A View of the Evidence (London, 1783), p. 13</ref>             \n\nDuring the winter of 1776\u20131777, Howe split his army into scattered cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, November 30, 1776</ref> Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.<ref>Stedman, American War, Volume I, p. 287</ref>\n\n===== Clinton and Cornwallis =====\n[[File:First Marquis of Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] led British forces in the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|southern campaign]].]]\n\nIn 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">[[#lumpkin|Lumpkin, 2000]], p. 60</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref name=\"auto3\" /> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\" />\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.<ref name=\"Ketchum, p. 205\" /> Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.<ref>Lengel, Edward (2005). General George Washington. New York: Random House Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0812969502}}. p. 337</ref> These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.<ref>Fleming, Thomas (1970). The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|9780061139116}}, p. 16</ref>\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, September 15, 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, December 15, 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, July 19 and August 29, 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, October 31, 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39</ref><ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signaled the end of a conflict,<ref>Rossman, Vadim (2016), \"Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation\", Taylor & Francis, {{ISBN|1317562852}}, p. 2</ref> yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston.<ref>Edward E. Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved June 10, 2017</ref> Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and to enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was agrarian, not urban, and the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.<ref name=\"Pole 2004\"/>\n\n[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Black Loyalist]] soldiers fighting alongside British regulars in the 1781 [[Battle of Jersey]], from ''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'']]\n\nThe need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in [[Jacobite rising of 1745#Legacy|Scotland]] and [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Ireland]].<ref>Black (2001), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists.<ref>[[#wilson2005|Wilson, 2005]], p. 112</ref> Neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Patriots when brutal combat broke out between Tories and Whigs in the Carolinas in the later stages of the war.<ref>Black (2001), pp. 14\u201316 (Harsh methods), pp. 35, 38 (slaves and Indians), p. 16 (neutrals into revolutionaries).</ref> Conversely, Loyalists were often emboldened when Patriots resorted to intimidating suspected Tories, such as destroying property or [[tarring and feathering]].<ref>Leonard Woods Larabee, Conservatism in Early American History (1948) pp 164\u201365</ref><ref>Calhoon, Robert M.

On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control.

They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.

PLEASE DISCUSS IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE IT-->\nThe '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was fought primarily between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and her [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America, resulting in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the [[United States of America]].{{efn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as \"Americans\", with occasional references to \"Patriots\" or \"Revolutionaries\". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing political differences concering colonial representaion in Parliament strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies and fueled the resentment that led to the [[American Revolution]]. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against taxation without [[No taxation without representation|representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroying a shipment of tea in [[Boston Tea Party|Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing the harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]]{{efn|[[Province of Georgia|The colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later.}} to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress unanimously appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate  [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n                                           \nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]]; by the end of September 1779, Spanish troops had cleared all British forts and settlers located in the entire region along the Mississippi.<!--<ref>[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy, 2013]], p. 179</ref>--> The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] and Washington then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis' army]] and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n                                           \n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America, but the war continued against France and Spain in Europe, the Caribbean and India. Britain successfully resisted Spain's [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|attempt to seize Gibraltar]] and scored a [[Battle of the Saintes|major victory]] over the French navy in the Caribbean. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.\n{{toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n            \n=== Taxation disputes ===\nParliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] and for the war itself. The colonists resented that they had to pay for a war that they fought in and had sacrificed many lives for. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of the British Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their jurisdictions.<ref>[[#bonwick|Bonwick, 1991]], pp. 71\u201372</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>[[#gladney|Gladney, 2014]], p. 5</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">[[#dickinson1977|Dickinson, 1977]], p. 218</ref> Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.<ref>[[#McIlwain|McIlwain, 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;[1938] ]], p. 51</ref> From 1767, Parliament began passing the [[Townshend Acts]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty, imposing taxes on imported goods such as tea, lead, glass, paper, items required by law to be purchased exclusively from Britain, while establishing the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. A [[Board of Customs]] was also created in Boston to enforce the Acts, while the New York Assembly was suspended, all of which fueled increasing resentment and widespread opposition among the colonists.<ref>[[#boyer|Boyer, 2014]], p. 142</ref><ref>Knollenberg, Growth, 48; Thomas, Duties Crisis, 76</ref><ref>[[#ferling2002|Ferling, 2002]], pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.<ref>[[#young|Young, 1999]], pp. 183\u201385</ref>]]\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The seizure of the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime, the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade, and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that outweighed the initial disadvantages which they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended on local production of food and most supplies rather than on imports, while British supplies were mostly shipped from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports; the British could capture any port, but that did not give them control over the inland areas. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communication. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Indians, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias and provide a training ground for the national army.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], ch. 36\u201339</ref> Motivation was also a major asset. The Patriots had much more popular support than the Loyalists, and more than 200,000 Americans fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Lanning195\u201396\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them militarily.

The inexperience of its officers was somewhat offset by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in winter quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics, and strategy, and he wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>Philander D.

Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home, were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare, but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\" />\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775 and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers and navy it had sent, which assisted him greatly in defeating Cornwallis during the surrender of Yorktown in 1781.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], pp. 203, 303, 391</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost more battles than he won, but never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2007]], pp. 258-261</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged with selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name=gardner3/><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p. 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref> Owing to the precarious nature of the committee process, Congress created the post of Secretary of War which replaced the Board of War and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] as its first secretary in February, 1781. Washington worked closely with Lincoln in organizing the relationship between civilian and military authorities.<ref name=gardner3/>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. He transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp. 429\u201336.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990) p. 220.</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Edward G.

To this end they formed the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]], which operated from 1775-1776, for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\".  Through secret correspondence the Committee forged alliances and shared information with persons in France, England and within America. The Committee employed secret agents in Europe to gather foreign intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications and to initiate American propaganda campaigns to gain patriot support.<ref name=cia2011>[[#cia|CIA, 2011, Historical Document]]</ref> Some notable members of the Committee included [[Thomas Paine]], the Committee's secretary, and [[Silas Deane]] who was sent undercover to France and was instrumental in securing her aid.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;[2006] ]], p. 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Culper Ring code.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Page from Culper Ring's code book, with names adjacent to their code numbers]]\n\nAfter the British were driven out of Boston during the [[Seige of Boston]] they redeployed in Nova Scotia. Washington anticipating that they would soon attack New York City, departed Boston on April 4 with his army and headed for Manhattan and began constructing fortifications [[Heights of Guan|about the harbor]]. Realizing he needed advance information to best deal with the British, Washington on August 12, 1776, selected and promoted [[Thomas Knowlton]] to lieutenant colonel with orders to select an elite group of 130 men and 20 officers, which came to be known as [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the Army's first intelligence unit. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and other secret missions that were considered too dangerous for regular troops. Knowlton was killed in action on September 17, at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] while on a mission observing British troop activity.<ref>[[#johnston1897|Johnston, 1897]], p. 61</ref>Among the Rangers was the young [[Nathan Hale]].<ref name=cia2011/><ref>[[#kilmeade|Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2013]], pp. 20-22</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the British landed on Long Island with overwhelming force during the [[Battle of Long Island]] and forced Washington to retreat across the East River to New York City, on Manhattan Island{{efn|The city in 1776 only occupied the southern tip of Manhattan.}} Washington knew a British attack on city was imminent. Desperate to learn when and where the attack would occur he asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn. No one came forward, except for the 21 year old Nathan Hale, who, however, only provided  nominal intelligence to Washington. Soon after the British attack occurred on September 15, Hale was recognized in a tavern by a Loyalist shop keeper, was apprehended, found with sketches of British fortifications and troop positions in his pockets, and was ordered by Howe to be summarily hanged, the next day, without trial, on September 22.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], p. 134</ref> After Washington was driven out of New York he realized firsthand that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British.

Stewart 2005 p. 103\" /><ref name=\"Ellis 2013\" /> Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory.  After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.<ref name=\"Ridpath 1915\" /><ref name=\"auto\" /><ref name=\"Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221\" /> Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause<ref name=\"Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142\">Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref> and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,<ref name=\"American History 1982 p. 130\" /> Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.<ref name=\"Lecky, William 1891 p. 57\" />\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]]. At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H. Kennedy 2014 163\" />\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive maneuvers by the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.<ref>Frothingham pp. 152\u201353</ref><ref>Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005).

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">[[#lumpkin|Lumpkin, 2000]], p. 60</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref name=\"auto3\" /> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\" />\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.<ref name=\"Ketchum, p. 205\" /> Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.<ref>Lengel, Edward (2005). General George Washington. New York: Random House Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0812969502}}. p. 337</ref> These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.<ref>Fleming, Thomas (1970). The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|9780061139116}}, p. 16</ref>\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, September 15, 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, December 15, 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, July 19 and August 29, 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, October 31, 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39</ref><ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance.

On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control.

One of the sports which the Ta\u00edno's played was a ball game called \"Batey\". The \"Batey\" was played in \"U\" shaped fields two teams; however, unlike the ball games of the modern era, the winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.\n\nThe Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced various sports such as [[horse racing]], [[cockfighting]], [[dominoes]] and a game similar to \"Bowling\" called \"Boliche\". The Spaniards however did not participate in team sports.\n\nSpain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of their defeat in the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. American soldiers who organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of Boxing and Basketball to the people of Puerto Rico. The sport of baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States.\n\nPuerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation even though it is a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico has participated as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London. On March 2, 1917, Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the enactment of the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] (Pub.L. 64\u2013368, 39 Stat. 951) and as such  Puerto Ricans who resided in the United States mainland were and still are permitted to participate and represent that country in international sports events. However, their achievements representing the United States is part of the intertwined history of sports in the United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced in Puerto Rico and other countries and of the Puerto Ricans or people of Puerto Rican descent who have excelled in those sports locally and/or in international events as representatives of Puerto Rico or any other country.\n\n==Brief history of sports in Puerto Rico==\n\n===Pre-Columbian era===\n[[File:Tibes.JPG|thumb|250px|left|View of the Indigenous ballparks in the Tibes]]\nThe Ta\u00ednos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) and ball playing. The ball game was played in a field, which they called \"Batey\", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was made of vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.\" In 1975, archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in an area called Tibes, on the outskirts of the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered under thick forest overgrowth dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as \"[[Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes]]\" (The Tibes Indigenoius Ceremonial Center). The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art.<ref>http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/historia.html</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nThe first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated. The most common sports were [[horse racing]], [[cockfighting]] and [[dominoes]]. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One of the most popular sports was \"Boliche\". The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins. \"Boliche\" was similar to [[bowling]]. Another popular sport was [[bullfighting]], which was limited to the larger cities of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].\n\n===American (United States) colonization===\nIn the late 19th century \"new\" sports were introduced in Puerto Rico, after Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sports of boxing and basketball by the occupying military forces.\n\n==Modern era==\n\n===Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games===\n[[File:Flag of Puerto Rico.svg|200px|thumb|Flag of Puerto Rico]][[File:Laurie Hernandez Rio 2016.jpg|200px|thumb|Laurie Hernandez]][[File:Puig US16 (38) (29236398233).jpg|200px|thumb|Monica Puig won the first Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico]]\n\nPuerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation but because of Puerto Ricans having American citizenship, Puerto Rican athletes have the option of representing Puerto Rico or  moving to the United States, living there for 3 previous years or more and then representing that country in the games. Some Puerto Ricans, such as Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez in tennis, have won gold medals for the U.S.\n\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics]] celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in a major international sporting event. The island's delegation consisted of only three members, two of which finished among the ten best in [[pole vault]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/farandula/nota/eranotrostiempos-215093| title=Eran otros tiempos| author=Alex Figueroa Cancel| publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=2008-07-30| accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> In their regional participations, the Puerto Ricans had carried the United States flag into the games.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/farandula/nota/60anosdeolimpismoboricua-214804| title=60 a\u00f1os de olimpismo boricua| author=Alex Figueroa Cancel| publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=2008-07-29| accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> The United States protested, claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. The decree of [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] on July 25, 1952 would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own.\n\nIn 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow, Russian SFSR, USSR in protest of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. [[Germ\u00e1n Rieckehoff]], who was then the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in [[boxing]], [[Alberto Mercado]], who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics.\n\nIn 1982, the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by then governor [[Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3]], withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to [[Cuba]], where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which represent the island in the [[Pan American Games]] and the Central American and Caribbean Games.\n\nThe [[1988 Winter Olympics]], officially known as the \"XV Olympic Winter Games\", was celebrated  in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] between February 13 and 28. It was the first Winter Olympics ever held in Canada. It was also the first time that a Puerto Rican team was sent to represent the island in an Olympic ski competition. No Puerto Rican had ever skied in the Olympics. The six-person Puerto Rican ski team was made up of native Puerto Ricans. They were [[F\u00e9lix Flechas]], [[Walter Sandza]], [[Kevin Wilson (skier)|Kevin Wilson]], his sister [[Mary Pat Wilson]] and [[Jason Edelmann]]. Mary Pat Wilson is Puerto Rico's first and only female Olympic skier. Even though the team did not do well in the competition, they were highly respected by their competitors.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-88-games-two-virginians-skied-for-puerto-rico/2014/01/30/70aea924-7892-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html The Washington Post, \"In \u201988 Games, two Virginians skied for Puerto Rico\"]</ref>\n\n[[Kristina Brandi]] represented Puerto Rico in the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens, Greece]].

The game of [[baseball]] was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, it was looked upon as a silly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897. They were the Almendares Baseball Club, owned by Francisco Alamo Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.<ref name=\"BPR\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20010508194324/http://espanol.geocities.com/elpelotero_online/guante/puertorico.htm  B\u00e9isbol en Puerto Rico]</ref>\n\nAccording to the daily newspaper ''El Pa\u00eds'', on January 11, 1898, the first organized baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was located at the Pda.15 in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen team beat the Almendares with a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on January 30, 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3.<ref name=\"BPR\"/>\n\nPuerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet. On November 4, 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry with a score of 32 to 18.<ref name=\"BPR\"/> In the early 1920s, teams from Puerto Rico, such as the San Juan Stars, would travel to New York City and play against some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived there.\n\n'''Modern era'''\n\nPuerto Rico has over 100 [[Major League Baseball]] players who are currently active, in addition to the hundreds others who have participated in the past.

One of the sports which the Ta\u00edno's played was a ball game called \"Batey\". The \"Batey\" was played in \"U\" shaped fields two teams; however, unlike the ball games of the modern era, the winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.\n\nThe Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced various sports such as [[horse racing]], [[cockfighting]], [[dominoes]] and a game similar to \"Bowling\" called \"Boliche\". The Spaniards however did not participate in team sports.\n\nSpain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of their defeat in the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. American soldiers who organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of Boxing and Basketball to the people of Puerto Rico. The sport of baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States.\n\nPuerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation even though it is a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico has participated as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London. On March 2, 1917, Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the enactment of the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] (Pub.L. 64\u2013368, 39 Stat. 951) and as such  Puerto Ricans who resided in the United States mainland were and still are permitted to participate and represent that country in international sports events. However, their achievements representing the United States is part of the intertwined history of sports in the United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced in Puerto Rico and other countries and of the Puerto Ricans or people of Puerto Rican descent who have excelled in those sports locally and/or in international events as representatives of Puerto Rico or any other country.\n\n==Brief history of sports in Puerto Rico==\n\n===Pre-Columbian era===\n[[File:Tibes.JPG|thumb|250px|left|View of the Indigenous ballparks in the Tibes]]\nThe Ta\u00ednos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) and ball playing. The ball game was played in a field, which they called \"Batey\", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was made of vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.\" In 1975, archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in an area called Tibes, on the outskirts of the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered under thick forest overgrowth dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as \"[[Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes]]\" (The Tibes Indigenoius Ceremonial Center). The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art.<ref>http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/historia.html</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nThe first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated. The most common sports were [[horse racing]], [[cockfighting]] and [[dominoes]]. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One of the most popular sports was \"Boliche\". The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins. \"Boliche\" was similar to [[bowling]]. Another popular sport was [[bullfighting]], which was limited to the larger cities of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].\n\n===American (United States) colonization===\nIn the late 19th century \"new\" sports were introduced in Puerto Rico, after Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sports of boxing and basketball by the occupying military forces.\n\n==Modern era==\n\n===Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games===\n[[File:Flag of Puerto Rico.svg|200px|thumb|Flag of Puerto Rico]][[File:Laurie Hernandez Rio 2016.jpg|200px|thumb|Laurie Hernandez]][[File:Puig US16 (38) (29236398233).jpg|200px|thumb|Monica Puig won the first Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico]]\n\nPuerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation but because of Puerto Ricans having American citizenship, Puerto Rican athletes have the option of representing Puerto Rico or  moving to the United States, living there for 3 previous years or more and then representing that country in the games. Some Puerto Ricans, such as Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez in tennis, have won gold medals for the U.S.\n\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics]] celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in a major international sporting event. The island's delegation consisted of only three members, two of which finished among the ten best in [[pole vault]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/farandula/nota/eranotrostiempos-215093| title=Eran otros tiempos| author=Alex Figueroa Cancel| publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=2008-07-30| accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> In their regional participations, the Puerto Ricans had carried the United States flag into the games.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/farandula/nota/60anosdeolimpismoboricua-214804| title=60 a\u00f1os de olimpismo boricua| author=Alex Figueroa Cancel| publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=2008-07-29| accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> The United States protested, claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. The decree of [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] on July 25, 1952 would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own.\n\nIn 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow, USSR. [[Germ\u00e1n Rieckehoff]], who was then the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in [[boxing]], [[Alberto Mercado]], who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics.\n\nIn 1982, the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by then governor [[Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3]], withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to [[Cuba]], where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which represent the island in the [[Pan American Games]] and the Central American and Caribbean Games.\n\nThe [[1988 Winter Olympics]], officially known as the \"XV Olympic Winter Games\", was celebrated  in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] between February 13 and 28. It was the first Winter Olympics ever held in Canada. It was also the first time that a Puerto Rican team was sent to represent the island in an Olympic ski competition. No Puerto Rican had ever skied in the Olympics. The six-person Puerto Rican ski team was made up of native Puerto Ricans. They were [[F\u00e9lix Flechas]], [[Walter Sandza]], [[Kevin Wilson (skier)|Kevin Wilson]], his sister [[Mary Pat Wilson]] and [[Jason Edelmann]]. Mary Pat Wilson is Puerto Rico's first and only female Olympic skier. Even though the team did not do well in the competition, they were highly respected by their competitors.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-88-games-two-virginians-skied-for-puerto-rico/2014/01/30/70aea924-7892-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html The Washington Post, \"In \u201988 Games, two Virginians skied for Puerto Rico\"]</ref>\n\n[[Kristina Brandi]] represented Puerto Rico in the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens, Greece]].

Puerto Rico currently has 4 football leagues. PR Pee Wee league, for children 8-16, PRHSFL, for high school students, the newly created AFAF, for college students, and PRAFL, a semi-professional league. Although football has been in the island for so many years, it is not widely known. Many things attribute to this, for example lack of proper funding and advertising, lack of high school affiliated teams, both attributing to lack of good coaching. In July 2012, the Puerto Rico American Football Federation became a member of the [[International Federation of American Football]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ifaf.org/articles/view/1319 |title=IFAF Congress Ratifies New International Federation Structure |publisher=[[International Federation of American Football]] |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}</ref>\n\n'''Pee Wee Football League'''\nThis federation has 4 divisions, with areas in: Baldrich, Parque Central, University Gardens, Parkville, Ft.

The game of [[baseball]] was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, it was looked upon as a silly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897. They were the Almendares Baseball Club, owned by Francisco Alamo Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.<ref name=\"BPR\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20010508194324/http://espanol.geocities.com/elpelotero_online/guante/puertorico.htm  B\u00e9isbol en Puerto Rico]</ref>\n\nAccording to the daily newspaper ''El Pa\u00eds'', on January 11, 1898, the first organized baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was located at the Pda.15 in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen team beat the Almendares with a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on January 30, 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3.<ref name=\"BPR\"/>\n\nPuerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet. On November 4, 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry with a score of 32 to 18.<ref name=\"BPR\"/> In the early 1920s, teams from Puerto Rico, such as the San Juan Stars, would travel to New York City and play against some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived there.\n\n'''Modern era'''\n\nPuerto Rico has over 100 [[Major League Baseball]] players who are currently active, in addition to the hundreds others who have participated in the past. These facts combine to make baseball one of the most popular sports in the island.\n\nSome of the most notable baseball players from Puerto Rico are five Hall of Famers [[Roberto Clemente]], [[Orlando Cepeda]], [[Roberto Alomar]], [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez|Iv\u00e1n \"Pudge\" Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Edgar Martinez]].

F\u00fatbol, unlike in many of the other Latin American countries, mainly because of the strong American culture influence on the Island, did not enjoy high popularity during the 20th century. But since the new millennium it has slowly increased its fan base on the island. [[Puerto Rico]] has a [[FIFA]] sponsored federation, the [[Federaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de F\u00fatbol]] and a Senior National Team which is ranked 106 by [[FIFA]]. [[Puerto Rico]] has only made it as far as the second round or regional play for a [[World Cup Qualifier]], this was in 2008 when it beat [[Dominican Republic]] 1-0 in the first round and lost against [[Honduras]] in the second round with an aggregate score of 6-2.\n\n[[Puerto Rico]] currently has a professional league called the [[Puerto Rico Soccer League]] which was founded in 2008 and is composed of 8 teams. It also had the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]], which played in the [[North American Soccer League (2010)|North American Soccer League]], the second tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]]. The team has been defunct since 2012; however, in June 2015 a new NASL team, [[Puerto Rico FC]], was announced.<ref>http://www.nasl.com/news/2015/06/11/carmelo-anthonys-puerto-rico-fc-joins-north-american-soccer-league</ref>\nIn 2017, [[Puerto Rico Sol]] became the first women's pro soccer club in the Caribbean.\n\nThe following are among the players who have played for Puerto Rico: [[H\u00e9ctor Ramos]], [[Alexis Rivera Curet]], [[Andr\u00e9s Cabrero]]. There are several other Puerto Rican players or players of Puerto Rican descent playing abroad in foreign leagues.\n\n===Softball===\nWomen's softball has enjoyed certain popularity in Puerto Rico. The women's national softball team has won many international events and participated at many Olympics.\n\n[[Lisa Fernandez]] has represented the United States as member of the U.S. Women's Olympic Softball Team, winning gold medals in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia and in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. She established a women's softball record when she struck out 25 members of the women's Australian Olympic Softball Team. [[Ivelisse Echevarr\u00eda]] who in 2003 was inducted into the International Softball Federation Hall of Fame is also considered by many to be the greatest pitcher born in Puerto Rico. Ten Puerto Ricans have been inducted into the International Softball Federation Hall of Fame so far.\n\nThe ten Puerto Ricans in International Softball Federation Hall of Fame are: Juan Pachot, Carlos Velasquez Class of 1997; Ismael \"Chavalillo\" Delgado, Jorge Tanco, [[Alejandro Cruz|Alejandro \"Junior\" Cruz]] Class of 1993 and Ivelisse Echevarria, Betty Segarra, Clara Vazquez, Jose \"Tuto\" Agosto, Rafi Serrano Class of 2003.\n\n===Swimming (competitive)===\n[[File:Olympic Medalist Maritza Correia takes the Pledge (25899205524).jpg|250px|thumb|Olympic Medalist Maritza Correia]]\n[[Jesse Vassallo|Jesus \"Jesse\" Vassallo]] is considered by many to be the greatest swimmer to have been born in Puerto Rico. In 1997, he became the first and so far the only Puerto Rican to be inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]]. He currently heads the Puerto Rico Swimming Federation.\n\nIn 1966, 17-year-old [[Anita Lallande]] set a new record in the Central American and Caribbean Games celebrated in San Juan, when she won a total of 10 gold medals.\n\n[[Fernando Ca\u00f1ales]] was a 100-meter freestyle finalist in the 1978 Berlin World Championships, earning a 5th place. He was the \"first\" Puerto Rican swimmer to final in the World Championships. He earned 5 gold medals and 1 silver medal during the 1978 Central American Championships in [[Medell\u00edn]], [[Colombia]]. He became the first Puerto Rican to medal in the [[Pan American Games]] by winning silver in the 100&nbsp;meters free in 1979 (San Juan, Puerto Rico) and repeating that feat in 1983 (Caracas, Venezuela).\n\n[[Maritza Correia]], is the first black Puerto Rican woman in history to make the U.S. Olympic Swimming Team. She earned a silver medal swimming prelims of the 400m free relay at the [[2004 Olympic Games]] celebrated in [[Athens]], Greece.\n\nYears after the demolition of the Escambr\u00f3n Swimming Complex, San Juan Mayor [[Jorge Santini]] will open the new roofed [[San Juan Natatorium]], developed by San Juan Sports Director [[Mar\u00eda Elena Batista]], herself a former Olympic Swimmer. The official opening of the San Juan Natatorium was December 15, 2006. A second natatorium is scheduled to open in time for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayag\u00fcez.\n\nOn May 19, 2012, [[Olrando Fern\u00e1ndez]], also known as \"The Puerto Rican [[Aquaman]]\", became the first Puerto Rican to swim  across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>[http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/otros/nota/cruceanadoenlaplayadeponceesteseptiembre-540042/ Cruce a Nado en la Playa de Ponce este septiembre]</ref>\n\n===Tennis===\n[[File:Gigi Fernandez.jpg|thumb|250px|Gigi Fernandez, as a tennis ambassador, speaking at a Hispanic Engagement Tennis Event.]]\nTennis is not very popular as a fan sport in Puerto Rico, but many Puerto Ricans practice it as a means of exercise. The 1984 television match between [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez]] was one of the most watched events of the year in Puerto Rican television. Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez is arguably Puerto Rico's most famous tennis player ever, having won doubles championships in Grand Slam tournaments, including [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]], winning gold medals for the USA doubles team in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, being ranked no. 1 in the world for women's doubles tournaments, and being ranked among the top 30 singles players for most of her career. She is widely considered to be one of the greatest doubles players of all time.\n\n[[Kristina Brandi]] is the first Puerto Rican tennis player to win an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] tennis match representing Puerto Rico. Brandi represented Puerto Rico in the [[2004 Olympics]], where she beat [[Jelena Kostani\u0107]] from [[Croatia]] (7-5 and 6-1).\n\n[[Charlie Pasarell]] was another noted Puerto Rican Tennis player. He lost to [[Pancho Gonzalez]] in 1969, in the second longest singles match by number of games before the introduction of the tiebreaker. It took Pancho Gonzales 112 games to defeat Charlie Pasarell in the first round 22\u201324, 1\u20136, 16\u201314, 6\u20133, 11\u20139.\n\nRafael Jordan was a player that many considered had potential to become a men's professional tour champion, but he died after an automobile accident during the mid-1990s.\n\n[[Monica Puig]] became the first person to win an Olympic Gold Medal for Puerto Rico at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. She defeated Germany's Angelique Kerber in the women's singles tennis final.<ref name=\"MP\"/>\n\n===Track and field===\n[[File:2012-06-07 Bislett Games Javier Culson01.jpg|200px|thumb|Javier Culson]]\nTrack and Field has been another sport of note in Puerto Rico. Most schools there base their field days only on track and field events. Many Puerto Rican runners, hurlers and throwers have participated at the Olympics. Famous Puerto Rican track and fielders include [[Rebekah Colberg]] and [[Angelita Lind]].\n\nColberg, also known as \"The Mother of Women's Sports in Puerto Rico\", from 1932\u20131946, for fourteen consecutive years was Puerto Rico's [[tennis]] champion. In 1938, she won two [[gold medal]]s at the IV [[Central American and Caribbean Games]], celebrated in [[Panama]], in the [[discus]] and [[Javelin throw|javelin]] events. In 1946, when the games were celebrated in Mexico, she won a gold medal in [[softball]]. While studying for her master's degree at Columbia University, she was in the university's [[field hockey]] and [[lacrosse]] championship teams. She was also a member of the undefeated women's [[basketball]] team of the University of Mexico.\n\nLind, known as \"The Angel of Puerto Rico\", has represented the island and participated in three [[Central American and Caribbean Games]] (CAC) and won two [[gold medal]]s, three [[silver medal]]s and one [[bronze medal]]. She also participated in three [[Pan American Games]] and in the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] celebrated in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n[[Javier Culson]] made history by becoming the first Puerto Rican track and field runner in an Olympic Game, to win the bronze medal at the [[2012 London Olympics]]. He won it in the 400 metre hurdle competition.\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe [[Puerto Rican Volleyball Federation]] was founded in 1958, the first men's tournament organized was the 'Torneo Preolimpico'. The federation's first president was [[Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Purcell Rodr\u00edguez|Jose L. Purcell]]. Ten years later the [[Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino|Women's League]] was established.\n\nLong considered the dormant sport among major sports in Puerto Rico, Volleyball has enjoyed much popularity since the 1990s, both in its professional and beach volleyball versions. Puerto Rico's ''Liga Superior de Voleibol'' has thrived in recent years, both in the [[Liga de Voleibol Superior Masculino|men's]] and [[Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino|women's]] tournaments.\n\nIn 1970, most of Puerto Rico's national women's volleyball team's members were killed [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster|when a plane that was flying them to San Juan, Puerto Rico from the Dominican Republic crashed shortly after take-off]].\n\nIn 1997, debut of foreign player in [[Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino|Women League]]. The most dominated are Laura Salinas from Monterrey, Mexico, lead the [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico national team]] to several international competition. The foreign player debut in Women's League in 2000.\n\nSome of Puerto Rico's famous volleyball players are Willie De Jesus, [[Ra\u00fal Papaleo]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Soto]]. Papaleo and [[Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez (beach volleyball)|Ram\u00f3n 'Monchito' Hern\u00e1ndez]] participated in 2004 Olympic Games in Athens in Beach Volleyball, first ever volleyball team in the Island Olympic history.  [[Laura Daniela Lloreda]], meanwhile, is a Puerto Rican who played in Mexico's national volleyball team.\n\n[[H\u00e9ctor Soto|H\u00e9ctor \"Picky\" Soto]] is the first Latin American player that has led the scoring in the World Championship's history. Soto won the Best Scorer award in 2006 FIVB World Championship in Japan and 2007 FIVB World Cup in Japan. During the World Cup, he scored 43 point against Korea, in the process establishing a scoring record. Outside of his international performance, Soto has played in the professional leagues of Italy, Tunisia, Japan and Russia.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico/Did you know-Puerto Rico?}}\n*[[List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico]]\n* [[List of Puerto Ricans#Sports|List of Puerto Ricans - Sports]]\n* [[List of Puerto Rico-related topics]]\n* [[World's Best 10K]] (Marat\u00f3n Teodoro Moscoso)\n* [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]]\n* [[World Wrestling Council]]\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Puerto_Rican_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame Puerto Rican Baseball Hall of Fame]\n*[[History of women in Puerto Rico]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://archive.today/20130119200525/http://www.coquisports.com/ Coqui Sports de Puerto Rico]\n* [http://www.olimpur.com/ Comite Ol\u00edmpico de Puerto Rico]\n* [http://comisionmotocross.com/default.asp Comisi\u00f3n de Motocross de Puerto Rico ]\n* [http://www.fpvoleibol.com Federaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de Voleibol]\n* [http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?assoc=3231&pID=11 Federacion de Baloncesto de Puerto Rico]\n* [http://fpba.tripod.com/ Federaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de Boxeo Aficionado]\n* [http://www.fedefutbolpr.com/default.html Federaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de F\u00fatbol]\n* [http://www.puertoricofootball.com/ Football Americano en Puerto Rico]\n\n{{Puerto Rico topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Sport in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sports In Puerto Rico}}\n[[Category:History of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Sports in Puerto Rico| ]]\n", "name_user": "Spdslecturer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePuerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_Puerto_Rico"}

It produces egg-shaped tuberous roots {{convert|2|cm|inch}} to {{convert|8|cm|inch}} long at the end of fibrous roots. The leaves are large, up to {{convert|60|cm|inch}} long and {{convert|20|cm|inch}} wide.  [[Indigenous people of the Americas]] have used the durable leaves to make traditional medicines and as baby clothing. Leren usually reproduces itself through [[rhizomes]] which produce shoots and new plants.<ref>FAO, p. 240</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\nLeren is adapted to a tropical climate with alternating rainy and dry seasons.  It sprouts with the first rains and grows rapidly, forming tubers which are harvested as the foliage begins to die back eight or nine months after the initial sprouting.  The rhizomes, harvested at the same time, are tolerant of both drying and flooding, and divided and replanted again at the onset of the rainy season.  Frequent irrigation is necessary during dry periods.  Leren is often planted in shade or partial shade but can grow in full sun with adequate moisture and nutrients.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 252-252</ref>\n\nLeren is traditionally cultivated on a small scale.  Its cultivation is declining as it has been replaced by other crops.<ref>FAO, p. 239</ref>\n\n==Food==\nLeren is usually cooked by boiling the tubers for 15 to 60 minutes,  As food, leren is often compared to water chestnut ([[Eleocharis dulcis]]) because leren, like the water chestnut, retains its crispness despite being cooked. Boiled leren has a taste similar to [[sweet corn]], hence one of its common English names. The cooked tuber is covered with a thin, edible skin which is most easily peeled after cooking. Leren is mostly eaten as an [[hors d'oeuvre]] or appetizer. Leren tubers can be stored at room temperatures for up to three months, but do not tolerate refrigeration well.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 254-256</ref>\n\nThe nutritional value of leren has not been thoroughly studied, but the tubers have a starch content of 13-15 percent and a protein content of 6.6 percent.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, p. 254</ref>\n\n==Prehistoric domestication==\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have discovered that leren was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Leren, along with arrowroot (''[[Maranta arundinacea]]''), [[squash (plant)|squash]] (''[[Cucurbita moschata]]''), and bottle gourd (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'') were being cultivated in northern South American and Panama between 8200 BCE and 5600 BCE.<ref>Piperno, Dolores R. (Oct 2011), \"The Origins of Plant Cultivation and Domestication in the New World Tropics\", ''Current Anthropology'', Vol 52, No. 54, p. S 459.  Downloaded from JSTOR.</ref> It appears that the cultivation of leren spread to places where it was not likely native.  For example, the people of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas culture]] on the arid and semi-arid [[Santa Elena Peninsula]] of [[Ecuador]] grew leren by about 7000 BCE. Leren was being grown there to be eaten raw, dried, or ground into flour.<ref>Moore, Jerry D. (2014), ''A Prehistory of South America'', Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 97-99.

Leren tubers can be stored at room temperatures for up to three months, but do not tolerate refrigeration well.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 254-256</ref>\n\nThe nutritional value of leren has not been thoroughly studied, but the tubers have a starch content of 13-15 percent and a protein content of 6.6 percent.<ref>Martin and Cabanillas, p. 254</ref>\n\n==Prehistoric domestication==\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have discovered that leren was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Leren, along with arrowroot (''[[Maranta arundinacea]]''), [[squash (plant)|squash]] (''[[Cucurbita moschata]]''), and bottle gourd (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'') were being cultivated in northern South American and Panama between 8200 BCE and 5600 BCE.<ref>Piperno, Dolores R.

For example, the people of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas culture]] on the arid and semi-arid [[Santa Elena Peninsula]] of [[Ecuador]] grew leren by about 7000 BCE. Leren was being grown there to be eaten raw, dried, or ground into flour.<ref>Moore, Jerry D. (2014), ''A Prehistory of South America'', Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 97-99.
