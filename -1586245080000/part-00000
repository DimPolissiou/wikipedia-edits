Halakha is based on biblical commandments (''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]''), subsequent [[Talmud]]ic and [[rabbinic law]], and the customs and traditions compiled in the many books such as the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. ''Halakha'' is often translated as \"Jewish Law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word derives from the [[Semitic root|root]] that means \"to behave\" (also \"to go\" or \"to walk\"). ''Halakha'' guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but also numerous aspects of day-to-day life.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-the-laws-of-jewish-life/ \"Halacha: The Laws of Jewish Life.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nHistorically, in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''halakha'' served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law \u2013 both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[religious law|religious]], since no differentiation exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (''[[Haskalah]]'') and [[Jewish emancipation]], some have come to view the ''halakha'' as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the authoritative, canonical text recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Under contemporary [[Israeli law]], certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so are treated according to ''halakha''. Some differences in ''halakha'' are found among [[Ashkenazi]], [[Mizrahi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian]] and other Jewish communities who historically lived in isolation.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-customs/ \"Jewish Custom (Minhag) Versus Law (Halacha).\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n[[File:Talmud set.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A full set of the Babylonian Talmud]]\nThe word ''halakha'' is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root ''halakh'' \u2013 \"to walk\" or \"to go\".<ref name=\"EncJudaica\">{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia Judaica |edition= 2 |volume=0 |issue=8 |chapter= Halakhah |first= Louis |last= Jacobs}}</ref>{{rp|252}} Taken literally, therefore, ''halakha'' translates as \"the way to walk\", rather than \"law\". The word ''halakha'' refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law. The term may also be related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{lang|akk|ilku}}'', a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as ''{{lang|arc|halakh}}'', designating one or several obligations.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\">{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.academia.edu/23518527 |title= Halakhah |section= Second Temple and Hellenistic Judaism |first= Lawrence H. |last= Schiffman |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception |volume=11 |pages=2\u20138 |publisher= De Gruyter |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Halakha'' is often contrasted with ''[[aggadah]]'' (\"the telling\"), the diverse corpus of rabbinic [[Exegesis|exegetical]], narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other \"non-legal\" texts.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\"/> At the same time, since writers of ''halakha'' may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. ''Halakha'' also does not include the parts of the [[Torah]] not related to commandments.\n\n''Halakha'' constitutes the practical application of the [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] (\"commandments\") in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (the \"[[Oral Torah]]\"), and as codified in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhic-texts-101/ \"Introduction to Halacha, the Jewish Legal Tradition.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref> Because ''halakha'' is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole \"official voice\", different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the [[Jewish diaspora]], Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for ''halakha''.\n\n== Commandments (mitzvot) ==\n{{Main|Mitzvah#Mitzvot and Jewish law|613 commandments}}\nAccording to the Talmud (''Tractate Makot''), 613 ''mitzvot'' are in the Torah, 248 positive (\"thou shalt\") ''mitzvot'' and 365 negative (\"thou shalt not\") ''mitzvot'', supplemented by seven ''mitzvot'' [[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|legislated by the rabbis]] of antiquity.<ref>Hecht, Mendy.

These laws are composed of the following:\n** The [[Written Torah]], laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n** The [[Oral Torah]], laws believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n* Laws of human origin including rabbinic decrees, interpretations, customs, etc.\n\nThis division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation.<ref name=\"Sinclair\" /> Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.\n\nA second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n\nCommandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments ''require'' an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) ''forbid'' a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.\n\nA further division is made between ''chukim'' (\"decrees\" \u2013 laws without obvious explanation, such as ''[[shatnez]]'', the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), ''mishpatim'' (\"judgements\" \u2013 laws with obvious social implications) and ''eduyot'' (\"testimonies\" or \"commemorations\", such as the [[Shabbat]] and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.\n\nA different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n* Laws in relation to God (''bein adam laMakom'', literally, \"between a person and the Place\"), and\n* Laws about relations with other people (''bein adam le-chavero'', literally, \"between a person and his friend\").\n\n== Sources and process ==\n<div class=\"floatright toccolours\" style=\"width:400px; width:calc(200px + 15vw); max-width:100%; box-sizing:border-box\">\n<div style=\"font-weight:bold;text-align:center\">Eras of Jewish law</div>\n* Chazal (literally, \"Our Sages, may their memory be blessed\"): all Jewish sages of the [[Mishna]], [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]] eras (c. 250 BCE \u2013 c. 625 CE).\n** The ''[[Zugot]]'' (literally, the \"pairs\"), both the 200-year period (c. 170 BCE \u2013 30 CE, \"Era of the Pairs\") during the Second TemplePeriod in which the spiritual leadership was in the hands of five successions of \"pairs\" of religious teachers, and to each of these pairs themselves.\n** The ''[[Tannaim]]'' (literally, the \"repeaters\") were rabbis living primarily in [[Eretz Yisrael]] who codified the [[Oral Torah]] in the form of the [[Mishnah]]; (0\u2013200 CE).\n** The ''[[Amoraim]]'' (literally, the \"sayers\") lived in both Eretz Yisrael and [[Babylonia]].

Y. Baer (in Zion, 17 (1951\u201352), 1\u201355) has argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of Bava Kamma, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.<ref name=\"EncJudaica\" />{{rp|256}}\n\nThe boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of ''halakha'' as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of ''halakha'' consulted include:\n* The foundational Talmudic literature (especially the [[Mishna]] and the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]) with commentaries;\n** [[Talmudic hermeneutics]]: the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the Scriptures; includes also the rules by which the Halakhot are derived from and established by the written law. These may be seen as the rules by which early Jewish law was derived.\n** ''[[Gemara]]'' \u2013 the Talmudic process of elucidating the ''halakha''\n* The post-Talmudic codificatory literature, such as Maimonides's [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with its commentaries;\n* Regulations and other \"legislative\" enactments promulgated by rabbis and communal bodies:\n** ''[[Gezeirah]]'' (literally, \"declaration\"): \"preventative legislation\" of the rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n** ''[[Takkanah]]'' (literally, \"Repair\", meaning also \"Regulation\"): \"positive legislation\", practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n* ''[[Minhag]]'': Customs, community practices, and customary law, as well as the exemplary deeds of prominent (or local) rabbis;\n* The ''[[responsa|she'eloth u-teshuvoth]]'' (responsa, literally, \"questions and answers\") literature.\n* ''[[Dina d'malkhuta dina|Dina d'malchuta dina]]'' (literally, \"the law of the king is law\"): an additional aspect of ''halakha'', being the principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to a law in Judaism. This principle applies primarily in areas of commercial, civil and criminal law.\n\nIn antiquity, the ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews\u2014rulings of the Sanhedrin became ''halakha''; see [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]]. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow ''halakha'', lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.\n\nSince the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, ''halakha'' has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic ''[[posek]]'' (literally, \"he who makes a statement\", \"decisor\") proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.\n\nUnder this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in ''halakha'' not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or [[vow]],<ref>[[Moshe Isserles|Rema]] [[Choshen Mishpat]] Chapter 25</ref> unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the ''posek'' handling a then-current question. In addition, the ''halakha'' embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).\n\nNotwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in ''halakha''. Notably, ''poskim'' frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a \"change\" in ''halakha''. For example, many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative ''poskim'' consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by ''halakha'') than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative [[Judaism]] in some cases explicitly interprets ''halakha'' to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see [[Halakha#Conservative Judaism|below]]).\n\nWithin certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]]. Within [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] has an official [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]].<ref>[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards \"Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.\"] ''The Rabbinical Assembly''. 9 April 2019.</ref>\n\nNote that Takkanot, the plural form of ''Takkanah'' above, in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah ''mitzvot''. (In common parlance sometimes people use the general term ''takkanah'' to refer either ''gezeirot'' or ''takkanot''.) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to \"uproot matters from the Torah\". In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (''shev v'al ta'aseh'', literally, ''thou shall stay seated and not do''). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e. g., blowing the ''[[shofar]]'' on Shabbat, or taking the ''[[Four Species|lulav and etrog]]'' on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath ''[[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|melakha]]''. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for [[Esther]]'s relationship with [[Ahasuerus]] (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article [[Takkanah]]. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism, see [[Conservative halakha]].\n\n=== Historical analysis ===\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\nThe antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (from Aramaic, literally, \"repeater\") to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (literally, \"measurements\", and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.\n\nThe Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim (\"Sages\") regarded them as Sinaitic ([[Law given to Moses at Sinai]]). The Artscroll Series writes in its Overview to the book of Ezra:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Writings = Kesuvim / The Writings : with a commentary anthologized from Rabbinic writings = Ketuvim : \u02bbim Perush Rashi, Metsudat Da\u1e7fid, Metsudat Tsiyon, \u1e7fe-\u02bbod|others=Scherman, Nosson,, Zlotowitz, Meir|isbn=1422617246|edition= First|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=951078375}}</ref>\n\n\"During the Mishnaitic and Talmudic periods, the Sages of Israel... took the eternal tools of exegesis and used them to reveal the secrets that had always been locked within the words of the Torah, secrets that Moses had taught Israel and that, in turn, had been transmitted orally for over a thousand years until the oral tradition began to crumble due to persecution and a lack of diligence. They did nothing new and certainly made no changes in the Torah; they merely made use of hermeneutic principles that had not been need while the tradition of study was still at its study was still at its zenith.\" (pg. xii-xiii)\n\nThe middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding.  Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. [[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[rabbi Ishmael]] and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. \"It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor [a contemporary of theirs named] [[Eliezer ben Jose]] sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day, but that they omitted from their collections many rules which were then followed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10801-middot-the-seven-of-hillel|title=TALMUD HERMENEUTICS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\nAkiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.\n\nSome scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael's ''middot'' (e. g., ''kal vahomer'', literally, a combination of the archaic form of the word for \"straw\" and the word for \"clay\" \u2013 \"straw and clay\", referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those ''middot'' are not Greek in origin.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=Rabbinic interpretation of scripture |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=The Hermeneutic Rules of the ''Aggadah'' |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Rabbinic methods of interpretation and Hellenistic rhetoric |first=David |last=Daube |journal=Hebrew Union College Annual |volume=22 |year=1949 |pages=239\u2013264 |jstor=23506588}}</ref>\n\n== Views today ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Midrash22.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Aaron22.jpg\n| width2 = 141\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The artistic freedom spirit of ''Aggadah'' (left, represented by [[Solomon]]) and the legal divine judgment rulings of ''[[Halakhah]] (right, represented by [[Aaron]] and his sons) on the [[Knesset Menorah]]\n}}\n{{See also|Talmud#Present day}}\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that ''halakha'' is the [[divine law]] as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees, and customs combined.

While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that ''halakha'' is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See [[Conservative Judaism#Beliefs|Conservative Judaism, Beliefs]].\n\n[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] holds that halakha is normative and binding, while also believing that it is an evolving concept and that the traditional halakhic system is incapable of producing a code of conduct that is meaningful for, and acceptable to, the vast majority of contemporary Jews. Reconstructionist founder [[Mordecai Kaplan]] believed that \"Jewish life [is] meaningless without Jewish law.\", and one of the planks of the Society for the Jewish Renascence, of which Kaplan was one of the founders, stated: \"We accept the halakha, which is rooted in the Talmud, as the norm of Jewish life, availing ourselves, at the same time, of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law in accordance with the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reconstructing Halakha |url=https://www.reconstructingjudaism.org/article/reconstructing-halakha |last=Cedarbaum |first=Daniel |agency=Reconstructing Judaism |date=6 May 2016 |access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] holds that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the \"traditionalist\" wing believe that the ''halakha'' represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person. Those in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era, most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counter-productive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even [[heresy|heretical]], by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.\n\nHumanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe \"that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old\". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oradam.org/OAC/FAQ/ |title=FAQ for Humanistic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Humanists, Humanistic Jews, Congregation, Arizona, AZ |publisher=Oradam.org |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nJews believe that [[gentiles]] are bound by a subset of ''halakha'' called the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], also referred to as the Noahide Laws. They are a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God to the \"children of Noah\" \u2013 that is, all of humanity.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Noahide-Laws \"Noahide Laws.\"] ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. 3 July 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Flexibility ===\nDespite its internal rigidity, ''halakha'' has a degree of flexibility in finding solutions to modern problems that are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a \"sense of continuity between past and present, a self-evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VahYCwAAQBAJ |title=Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |first1=John |last1=Corrigan |first2=Frederick |last2=Denny |first3=Martin S. |last3=Jaffee |first4=Carlos |last4=Eire |isbn=9780205018253 |edition= 2 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger's book ''Rabbinic Authority'', the authority that rabbis hold \"derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a ''communal'' decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rubenstein |first= Jeffrey L. |title= Michael Berger.

The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of [[electricity]] on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to \"consult your local rabbi or [[posek]]\". This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed onto higher rabbis who will then issue a ''teshuvot'', which is a ''responsa'' that is binding.<ref>Satlow, Michael, and Daniel Picus. \u201cJudaism, Christianity, and Islam.\u201d Lecture. Providence, Brown University.</ref> Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other's work so as to maintain the truest sense of ''halakha''. Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life. Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the \"divine\" authority of ''halakha'', traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.\n\n=== Denominational approaches ===\n==== Orthodox Judaism ====\n[[File:Haredim allant a la synagogue.jpg|thumb|Hasidim walk to the synagogue, [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]].]]\nOrthodox Jews believe that ''halakha'' is a religious system whose core represents the [[Revelation|revealed]] will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is nonspecific, they did so only in accordance with regulations received by [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai, Egypt|Mount Sinai]] (see {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy 5:8\u201313}}). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. They were then recorded in the [[Mishnah]], and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history up until the present day. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]].<ref name=\"JillJacobs\">Jacobs, Jill. [https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-shulhan-arukh/ \"The Shulchan Aruch.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nOrthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and extent to which change is permissible. [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews generally hold that even ''minhagim'' (customs) must be retained, and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. [[Modern Orthodox]] authorities are more inclined to permit limited changes in customs and some reconsideration of precedent.<ref>Sokol, Sam.

However, the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's revelation, and thus still has divine authority. Therefore, ''halakha'' is still seen as binding. Conservative Jews use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are, in some cases, willing to change Jewish law in the present.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-in-conservative-judaism/ \"Halakhah in Conservative Judaism.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nA key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body's powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by ''takkanah'' (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the \"driving teshuva\", which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on [[Mamzer]] status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot]]'' permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the [[the Bible and homosexuality|Bible]] and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the [[role of women in Judaism]] including counting women in a [[minyan]],<ref>Fine, David J.

[http://www.cwj.org.il/sites/default/files/Mamzerut%20-%20Spitz.pdf \"Mamzerut.\"] ''Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly''. EH 4.2000a. p. 586.</ref> The CJLS adopted the responsum's view that the \"morality which we learn through the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition\" informs the application of Mosaic law.<ref name=\"KaplanSpitz\" /> The responsum cited several examples of how the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the trial of the accused adulteress (''sotah''), the \"law of breaking the neck of the heifer,\" and the application of the death penalty for the \"rebellious child.\"<ref>Kaplan Spitz, p. 577-584.</ref> Kaplan Spitz argues that the punishment of the ''mamzer'' has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction. Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on ''mamzerut''.\n\n== Codes of Jewish law ==\n:'' The halakhic codes have influenced, and in turn, have been influenced by, the responsa; [[History of responsa in Judaism]] thus provides an informative complement to the below.''\nThe most important codifications of Jewish law include:\n* The Mishnah, composed by [[Judah haNasi|Rabbi Judah the Prince]], in 200&nbsp;CE, as a basic outline of the state of the Oral Law in his time. This was the framework upon which the Talmud was based; the Talmud's [[dialectic]] analysis of the content of the Mishna (''[[gemara]]''; completed c.&nbsp;500) became the basis for all later [[posek|halakhic decisions]] and subsequent [[codification (law)|codes]].\n* [[Codification (law)|Codification]]s by the [[Geonim]] of the halakhic material in the Talmud. \n** An early work, ''She'iltot'' (\"Questions\") by [[Achai of Shabcha]] (c.&nbsp;752), discusses over 190 ''mitzvot'' \u2013 exploring and addressing various questions on these. \n** The first legal [[codex]] proper, ''Halakhot Pesukot'' (\"Decided Laws\"), by [[Yehudai Gaon]] (c.&nbsp;760), rearranges the Talmud passages in a structure manageable to the layman. (It was written in [[Aramaic language#Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic|vernacular Aramaic]], and subsequently translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as ''Hilkhot Riu''). \n** ''Halakhot Gedolot'' (\"Great Law Book\"), by R.[[Simeon Kayyara]], published two generations later, contains extensive additional material, mainly from [[Responsa]] and [[Monograph]]s of the Geonim, and is presented in a form that is closer to the original Talmud language and structure. (Probably since it was distributed, also, amongst the newly established [[Ashkenazi]] communities.) The ''She'iltot'' was influential on both subsequent works.\n* The [[Hilchot HaRif]], was written by the Rabbi [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013\u20131103), it has summations of the legal material found in the Talmud. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud's halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberation; he also excluded all aggadic (non-legal, and homiletic) matter. The ''Hilchot'' soon superseded the geonic codes, as it contained all the decisions and the laws then relevant, and additionally, served as an accessible Talmudic commentary; it has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The [[Mishneh Torah]] by [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204). This work encompasses the full range of Talmudic law; it is organized and reformulated in a logical system \u2013 in 14 books, 83 sections and 1000 chapters \u2013 with each ''halakha'' stated clearly. The Mishneh Torah is very influential to this day, and several later works reproduce passages verbatim. It also includes a section on [[Metaphysics]] and [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamental beliefs]]. (Some claim this section draws heavily on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] science and metaphysics; others suggest that it is within the tradition of [[Saadia Gaon]].) It is the main source of practical ''halakha'' for many [[Yemenite Jews]] \u2013 mainly [[Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] \u2013 as well as for a growing community referred to as ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|talmidei haRambam]]''.\n* The work of ''the Rosh'', Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (1250?/1259?\u20131328), an abstract of the Talmud, concisely stating the final halakhic decision and quoting later authorities, notably Alfasi, Maimonides, and the [[Tosafists]]. This work superseded Rabbi Alfasi's and has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Gadol]]'' (The \"SeMaG\") of Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]] (first half of the 13th century, [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique|Coucy]], Northern France). \"SeMaG\" is organised around the 365 negative and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud (in light of the commentaries of [[Rashi]] and the [[Tosafot]]) and the other codes existent at the time. ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'' (\"SeMaK\") by [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]] is an abridgement of the ''SeMaG'', including additional practical ''halakha'', as well as agaddic and [[Musar literature|ethical]] material.\n* \"The Mordechai\" \u2013 by [[Mordecai ben Hillel]], d.&nbsp;[[Nuremberg]] 1298 \u2013 serves both as a source of analysis, as well of decided law. Mordechai considered about 350 halakhic authorities, and was widely influential, particularly amongst the Ashkenazi and [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] communities. Although organised around the ''Hilchot'' of ''the Rif'', it is, in fact, an independent work. It has been printed with every edition of the Talmud since 1482.\n[[File:Arba'ah Turim.jpg|thumb|200px|An illuminated manuscript of ''Arba'ah Turim'' from 1435.]]\n* The [[Arba'ah Turim]] (''The Tur'', lit. \"The Four Columns\") by Rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] (1270\u20131343, [[Toledo, Spain]]). This work traces the ''halakha'' from the Torah text and the Talmud through the [[Rishonim]], with the ''Hilchot'' of Alfasi as its starting point. Ben Asher followed Maimonides's precedent in arranging his work in a topical order, however, the Tur covers only those areas of Jewish law that were in force in the author's time. The code is divided into four main sections; almost all codes since this time have followed the Tur's arrangement of material.\n** [[Orach Chayim]]: \"The Way of Life\" worship and ritual observance in the home and [[synagogue]], through the course of the day, the weekly sabbath and the festival cycle.\n** [[Yoreh De'ah]]: \"Teach Knowledge\" assorted ritual prohibitions, dietary laws and regulations concerning [[menstruation|menstrual]] impurity.\n** [[Even Ha'ezer]]: \"The Rock of the Helpmate\" [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and other issues in [[family]] law.\n** [[Choshen Mishpat]]: \"The Breastplate of Judgement\" The administration and [[adjudication]] of civil law.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch|Beit Yosef, and the Shulchan Aruch]] of Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (1488\u20131575). The ''Beit Yosef'' is a huge commentary on the ''Tur'' in which Rabbi Karo traces the development of each law from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature (examining thirty-two [[posek|authorities]], beginning with the Talmud and ending with the works of Rabbi [[Israel Isserlein]]). The Shulchan Aruch is, in turn, a condensation of the ''Beit Yosef'' \u2013 stating each ruling simply (literally translated, ''Shulchan Aruch'' means \"set table\"); this work follows the chapter divisions of the Tur. The Shulchan Aruch, together with its related commentaries, is considered by many to be the most authoritative compilation of ''halakha'' since the Talmud. In writing the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Karo based his [[posek|rulings]] on three authorities \u2013 Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (Rif); he considered ''the Mordechai'' in inconclusive cases. [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]], generally, refer to the Shulchan Aruch as the basis for their daily practice.\n* The works of Rabbi [[Moshe Isserles]] (\"Rema\"; [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], 1525 to 1572). Isserles noted that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' was based on the [[Sephardic laws and customs|Sephardic]] tradition, and he created a series of [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to be appended to the text of the Shulkhan Aruch for cases where Sephardi and [[Ashkenazi]] [[minhag|customs]] differed (based on the works of [[Yaakov Moelin]], [[Israel Isserlein]], and [[Israel Bruna]]). The glosses are called ''Hamapah'' (\"the Tablecloth\"). His comments are now incorporated into the body of all printed editions of the Shulchan Aruch, typeset in a different script; today, \"Shulchan Aruch\" refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. Isserles' ''Darkhei Moshe'' is similarly a commentary on the Tur and the Beit Yosef.\n* The ''Levush Malkhut'' (\"Levush\") of Rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe]] (c. 1530\u20131612). A ten volume work, five discussing ''halakha'' at a level \"midway between the two extremes: the lengthy Beit Yosef of Karo on the one hand, and on the other Karo's Shulchan Aruch together with the Mappah of Isserles, which is too brief\", that particularly stresses the [[minhag|customs and practices]] of the Jews of Eastern Europe. The Levush was exceptional among the codes, in that it treated certain ''Halakhot'' from a Kabbalistic standpoint.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]] of Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (c. 1800) was an attempt to re-codify the law as it stood at that time \u2013 incorporating [[Shulchan Aruch#Major commentaries|commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch]], and [[History of Responsa#Acharonim|subsequent responsa]] \u2013 and thus stating the [[posek|decided ''halakha'']], as well as the underlying reasoning. The work was written partly so that laymen would be able to study Jewish law. Unfortunately, most of the work was lost in a fire prior to publication. It is the basis of practice for [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic groups]] and is quoted as authoritative by many subsequent works, Hasidic and non-Hasidic alike.\n* Works structured directly on the Shulchan Aruch, providing analysis in light of [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] material and codes:\n** The [[Mishnah Berurah]] of Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen]], (the \"Chofetz Chaim\", Poland, 1838\u20131933) is a commentary on the \"Orach Chayim\" section of the Shulchan Aruch, discussing the application of each ''halakha'' in light of all subsequent [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] decisions. It has become the authoritative halakhic guide for much of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Ashkenazic Jewry in the postwar period. \n** [[Aruch HaShulchan]] by Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] (1829\u20131888) is a scholarly analysis of ''halakha'' through the perspective of the major Rishonim. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch; rules dealing with vows, agriculture, and ritual purity, are discussed in a second work known as ''[[Aruch HaShulchan he'Atid]]''. \n** [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf HaChaim]] on [[Orach Chayim]] and parts of [[Yoreh De'ah]], by the Sephardi sage [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]] ([[Baghdad]] and [[Jerusalem]], 1870\u20131939) is similar in scope, authority and approach to the Mishnah Berurah. This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly [[Isaac Luria]]), when these impact the Halakha.\n** [[Yalkut Yosef]], by Rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]], is a voluminous, widely cited and contemporary work of ''halakha'', based on the rulings of Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]].\n* [[Layman]]-oriented digests of ''halakha'': \n** The ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' of Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]] ([[Hungary]] 1804\u20131886), based on the very strict Hungarian customs of the 19th century, became immensely popular after its publication due to its simplicity. This work is not binding in the same way as the Mishneh Torah or the Shulchan Aruch. It is still popular in [[Orthodox Judaism]] as a framework for study, if not always for practice. \n** [[Chayei Adam]] and [[Chochmat Adam]] by Rabbi  [[Avraham Danzig]] (Poland, 1748\u20131820) are Ashkenazi works regarded as a more appropriate basis for practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} \n** The [[Ben Ish Chai]] by [[Ben Ish Hai|Yosef Chaim]] ([[Baghdad]], 1832\u20131909) is a collection of the laws on everyday life interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly [[Torah portion]]. Its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in Sephardi Halakha.\n** [[Eliezer Melamed#Published works|''Peninei Halachah'']] by Rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]] (15 volumes thus far) covers a wide range of subjects, from Shabbat to organ donations, and in addition to clearly posing the practical law - reflecting the customs of various communities - also discusses the spiritual foundations of the Halakhot.\n* ''Temimei Haderech'' (\"A Guide To Jewish Religious Practice\") by Rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] with contributions from the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]. This scholarly work is based on the previous traditional law codes, but written from a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] point of view, and not accepted among Orthodox Jews.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Judaism|Law}}\n* [[Antinomianism]]\n* [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]]\n* [[Jewish ethics]]\n* [[Jewish medical ethics]]\n* [[Mishpat Ivri]]\n* [[Sharia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [[J.

Halakha is based on biblical commandments (''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]''), subsequent [[Talmud]]ic and [[rabbinic law]], and the customs and traditions compiled in the many books such as the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. ''Halakha'' is often translated as \"Jewish Law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word derives from the [[Semitic root|root]] that means \"to behave\" (also \"to go\" or \"to walk\"). ''Halakha'' guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but also numerous aspects of day-to-day life.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-the-laws-of-jewish-life/ \"Halacha: The Laws of Jewish Life.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nHistorically, in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''halakha'' served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law \u2013 both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[religious law|religious]], since no differentiation exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (''[[Haskalah]]'') and [[Jewish emancipation]], some have come to view the ''halakha'' as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the authoritative, canonical text recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Under contemporary [[Israeli law]], certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so are treated according to ''halakha''. Some differences in ''halakha'' are found among [[Ashkenazi]], [[Mizrahi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian]] and other Jewish communities who historically lived in isolation.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-customs/ \"Jewish Custom (Minhag) Versus Law (Halacha).\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n[[File:Talmud set.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A full set of the Babylonian Talmud]]\nThe word ''halakha'' is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root ''halakh'' \u2013 \"to walk\" or \"to go\".<ref name=\"EncJudaica\">{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia Judaica |edition= 2 |volume=0 |issue=8 |chapter= Halakhah |first= Louis |last= Jacobs}}</ref>{{rp|252}} Taken literally, therefore, ''halakha'' translates as \"the way to walk\", rather than \"law\". The word ''halakha'' refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law. The term may also be related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{lang|akk|ilku}}'', a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as ''{{lang|arc|halakh}}'', designating one or several obligations.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\">{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.academia.edu/23518527 |title= Halakhah |section= Second Temple and Hellenistic Judaism |first= Lawrence H. |last= Schiffman |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception |volume=11 |pages=2\u20138 |publisher= De Gruyter |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Halakha'' is often contrasted with ''[[aggadah]]'' (\"the telling\"), the diverse corpus of rabbinic [[Exegesis|exegetical]], narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other \"non-legal\" texts.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\"/> At the same time, since writers of ''halakha'' may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. ''Halakha'' also does not include the parts of the [[Torah]] not related to commandments.\n\n''Halakha'' constitutes the practical application of the [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] (\"commandments\") in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (the \"[[Oral Torah]]\"), and as codified in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhic-texts-101/ \"Introduction to Halacha, the Jewish Legal Tradition.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref> Because ''halakha'' is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole \"official voice\", different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the [[Jewish diaspora]], Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for ''halakha''.\n\n== Commandments (mitzvot) ==\n{{Main|Mitzvah#Mitzvot and Jewish law|613 commandments}}\nAccording to the Talmud (''Tractate Makot''), 613 ''mitzvot'' are in the Torah, 248 positive (\"thou shalt\") ''mitzvot'' and 365 negative (\"thou shalt not\") ''mitzvot'', supplemented by seven ''mitzvot'' [[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|legislated by the rabbis]] of antiquity.<ref>Hecht, Mendy.

These laws are composed of the following:\n** The [[Written Torah]], laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n** The [[Oral Torah]], laws believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n* Laws of human origin including rabbinic decrees, interpretations, customs, etc.\n\nThis division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation.<ref name=\"Sinclair\" /> Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.\n\nA second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n\nCommandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments ''require'' an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) ''forbid'' a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.\n\nA further division is made between ''chukim'' (\"decrees\" \u2013 laws without obvious explanation, such as ''[[shatnez]]'', the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), ''mishpatim'' (\"judgements\" \u2013 laws with obvious social implications) and ''eduyot'' (\"testimonies\" or \"commemorations\", such as the [[Shabbat]] and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.\n\nA different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n* Laws in relation to God (''bein adam laMakom'', literally, \"between a person and the Place\"), and\n* Laws about relations with other people (''bein adam le-chavero'', literally, \"between a person and his friend\").\n\n== Sources and process ==\n<div class=\"floatright toccolours\" style=\"width:400px; width:calc(200px + 15vw); max-width:100%; box-sizing:border-box\">\n<div style=\"font-weight:bold;text-align:center\">Eras of Jewish law</div>\n* Chazal (literally, \"Our Sages, may their memory be blessed\"): all Jewish sages of the [[Mishna]], [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]] eras (c. 250 BCE \u2013 c. 625 CE).\n** The ''[[Zugot]]'' (literally, the \"pairs\"), both the 200-year period (c. 170 BCE \u2013 30 CE, \"Era of the Pairs\") during the Second TemplePeriod in which the spiritual leadership was in the hands of five successions of \"pairs\" of religious teachers, and to each of these pairs themselves.\n** The ''[[Tannaim]]'' (literally, the \"repeaters\") were rabbis living primarily in [[Eretz Yisrael]] who codified the [[Oral Torah]] in the form of the [[Mishnah]]; (0\u2013200 CE).\n** The ''[[Amoraim]]'' (literally, the \"sayers\") lived in both Eretz Yisrael and [[Babylonia]].

Y. Baer (in Zion, 17 (1951\u201352), 1\u201355) has argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of Bava Kamma, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.<ref name=\"EncJudaica\" />{{rp|256}}\n\nThe boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of ''halakha'' as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of ''halakha'' consulted include:\n* The foundational Talmudic literature (especially the [[Mishna]] and the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]) with commentaries;\n** [[Talmudic hermeneutics]]: the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the Scriptures; includes also the rules by which the Halakhot are derived from and established by the written law. These may be seen as the rules by which early Jewish law was derived.\n** ''[[Gemara]]'' \u2013 the Talmudic process of elucidating the ''halakha''\n* The post-Talmudic codificatory literature, such as Maimonides's [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with its commentaries;\n* Regulations and other \"legislative\" enactments promulgated by rabbis and communal bodies:\n** ''[[Gezeirah]]'' (literally, \"declaration\"): \"preventative legislation\" of the rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n** ''[[Takkanah]]'' (literally, \"Repair\", meaning also \"Regulation\"): \"positive legislation\", practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n* ''[[Minhag]]'': Customs, community practices, and customary law, as well as the exemplary deeds of prominent (or local) rabbis;\n* The ''[[responsa|she'eloth u-teshuvoth]]'' (responsa, literally, \"questions and answers\") literature.\n* ''[[Dina d'malkhuta dina|Dina d'malchuta dina]]'' (literally, \"the law of the king is law\"): an additional aspect of ''halakha'', being the principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to a law in Judaism. This principle applies primarily in areas of commercial, civil and criminal law.\n\nIn antiquity, the ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews\u2014rulings of the Sanhedrin became ''halakha''; see [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]]. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow ''halakha'', lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.\n\nSince the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, ''halakha'' has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic ''[[posek]]'' (literally, \"he who makes a statement\", \"decisor\") proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.\n\nUnder this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in ''halakha'' not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or [[vow]],<ref>[[Moshe Isserles|Rema]] [[Choshen Mishpat]] Chapter 25</ref> unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the ''posek'' handling a then-current question. In addition, the ''halakha'' embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).\n\nNotwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in ''halakha''. Notably, ''poskim'' frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a \"change\" in ''halakha''. For example, many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative ''poskim'' consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by ''halakha'') than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative [[Judaism]] in some cases explicitly interprets ''halakha'' to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see [[Halakha#Conservative Judaism|below]]).\n\nWithin certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]]. Within [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] has an official [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]].<ref>[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards \"Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.\"] ''The Rabbinical Assembly''. 9 April 2019.</ref>\n\nNote that Takkanot, the plural form of ''Takkanah'' above, in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah ''mitzvot''. (In common parlance sometimes people use the general term ''takkanah'' to refer either ''gezeirot'' or ''takkanot''.) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to \"uproot matters from the Torah\". In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (''shev v'al ta'aseh'', literally, ''thou shall stay seated and not do''). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e. g., blowing the ''[[shofar]]'' on Shabbat, or taking the ''[[Four Species|lulav and etrog]]'' on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath ''[[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|melakha]]''. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for [[Esther]]'s relationship with [[Ahasuerus]] (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article [[Takkanah]]. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism, see [[Conservative halakha]].\n\n=== Historical analysis ===\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\nThe antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (from Aramaic, literally, \"repeater\") to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (literally, \"measurements\", and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.\n\nThe Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim (\"Sages\") regarded them as Sinaitic ([[Law given to Moses at Sinai]]). The Artscroll Series writes in its Overview to the book of Ezra:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Writings = Kesuvim / The Writings : with a commentary anthologized from Rabbinic writings = Ketuvim : \u02bbim Perush Rashi, Metsudat Da\u1e7fid, Metsudat Tsiyon, \u1e7fe-\u02bbod|others=Scherman, Nosson,, Zlotowitz, Meir|isbn=1422617246|edition= First|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=951078375}}</ref>\n\n\"During the Mishnaitic and Talmudic periods, the Sages of Israel... took the eternal tools of exegesis and used them to reveal the secrets that had always been locked within the words of the Torah, secrets that Moses had taught Israel and that, in turn, had been transmitted orally for over a thousand years until the oral tradition began to crumble due to persecution and a lack of diligence. They did nothing new and certainly made no changes in the Torah; they merely made use of hermeneutic principles that had not been need while the tradition of study was still at its study was still at its zenith.\" (pg. xii-xiii)\n\nThe middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding.  Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. [[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[rabbi Ishmael]] and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. \"It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor [a contemporary of theirs named] [[Eliezer ben Jose]] sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day, but that they omitted from their collections many rules which were then followed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10801-middot-the-seven-of-hillel|title=TALMUD HERMENEUTICS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\nAkiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.\n\nSome scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael's ''middot'' (e. g., ''kal vahomer'', literally, a combination of the archaic form of the word for \"straw\" and the word for \"clay\" \u2013 \"straw and clay\", referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those ''middot'' are not Greek in origin.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=Rabbinic interpretation of scripture |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=The Hermeneutic Rules of the ''Aggadah'' |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Rabbinic methods of interpretation and Hellenistic rhetoric |first=David |last=Daube |journal=Hebrew Union College Annual |volume=22 |year=1949 |pages=239\u2013264 |jstor=23506588}}</ref>\n\n== Views today ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Midrash22.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Aaron22.jpg\n| width2 = 141\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The artistic freedom spirit of ''Aggadah'' (left, represented by [[Solomon]]) and the legal divine judgment rulings of ''[[Halakhah]] (right, represented by [[Aaron]] and his sons) on the [[Knesset Menorah]]\n}}\n{{See also|Talmud#Present day}}\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that ''halakha'' is the [[divine law]] as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees, and customs combined.

While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that ''halakha'' is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See [[Conservative Judaism#Beliefs|Conservative Judaism, Beliefs]].\n\n[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] holds that halakha is normative and binding, while also believing that it is an evolving concept and that the traditional halakhic system is incapable of producing a code of conduct that is meaningful for, and acceptable to, the vast majority of contemporary Jews. Reconstructionist founder [[Mordecai Kaplan]] believed that \"Jewish life [is] meaningless without Jewish law.\", and one of the planks of the Society for the Jewish Renascence, of which Kaplan was one of the founders, stated: \"We accept the halakha, which is rooted in the Talmud, as the norm of Jewish life, availing ourselves, at the same time, of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law in accordance with the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reconstructing Halakha |url=https://www.reconstructingjudaism.org/article/reconstructing-halakha |last=Cedarbaum |first=Daniel |agency=Reconstructing Judaism |date=6 May 2016 |access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] holds that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the \"traditionalist\" wing believe that the ''halakha'' represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person. Those in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era, most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counter-productive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even [[heresy|heretical]], by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.\n\nHumanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe \"that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old\". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oradam.org/OAC/FAQ/ |title=FAQ for Humanistic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Humanists, Humanistic Jews, Congregation, Arizona, AZ |publisher=Oradam.org |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nJews believe that [[gentiles]] are bound by a subset of ''halakha'' called the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], also referred to as the Noahide Laws.

From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a \"sense of continuity between past and present, a self-evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VahYCwAAQBAJ |title=Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |first1=John |last1=Corrigan |first2=Frederick |last2=Denny |first3=Martin S. |last3=Jaffee |first4=Carlos |last4=Eire |isbn=9780205018253 |edition= 2 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger's book ''Rabbinic Authority'', the authority that rabbis hold \"derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a ''communal'' decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rubenstein |first= Jeffrey L. |title= Michael Berger.

The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of [[electricity]] on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to \"consult your local rabbi or [[posek]]\". This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed onto higher rabbis who will then issue a ''teshuvot'', which is a ''responsa'' that is binding.<ref>Satlow, Michael, and Daniel Picus. \u201cJudaism, Christianity, and Islam.\u201d Lecture. Providence, Brown University.</ref> Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other's work so as to maintain the truest sense of ''halakha''. Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life. Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the \"divine\" authority of ''halakha'', traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.\n\n=== Denominational approaches ===\n==== Orthodox Judaism ====\n[[File:Haredim allant a la synagogue.jpg|thumb|Hasidim walk to the synagogue, [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]].]]\nOrthodox Jews believe that ''halakha'' is a religious system whose core represents the [[Revelation|revealed]] will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is nonspecific, they did so only in accordance with regulations received by [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai, Egypt|Mount Sinai]] (see {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy 5:8\u201313}}). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. They were then recorded in the [[Mishnah]], and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history up until the present day. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]].<ref name=\"JillJacobs\">Jacobs, Jill.

[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews generally hold that even ''minhagim'' (customs) must be retained, and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. [[Modern Orthodox]] authorities are more inclined to permit limited changes in customs and some reconsideration of precedent.<ref>Sokol, Sam.

However, the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's revelation, and thus still has divine authority. Therefore, ''halakha'' is still seen as binding. Conservative Jews use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are, in some cases, willing to change Jewish law in the present.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-in-conservative-judaism/ \"Halakhah in Conservative Judaism.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nA key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body's powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by ''takkanah'' (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the \"driving teshuva\", which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on [[Mamzer]] status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot]]'' permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the [[the Bible and homosexuality|Bible]] and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the [[role of women in Judaism]] including counting women in a [[minyan]],<ref>Fine, David J.

[http://www.cwj.org.il/sites/default/files/Mamzerut%20-%20Spitz.pdf \"Mamzerut.\"] ''Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly''. EH 4.2000a. p. 586.</ref> The CJLS adopted the responsum's view that the \"morality which we learn through the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition\" informs the application of Mosaic law.<ref name=\"KaplanSpitz\" /> The responsum cited several examples of how the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the trial of the accused adulteress (''sotah''), the \"law of breaking the neck of the heifer,\" and the application of the death penalty for the \"rebellious child.\"<ref>Kaplan Spitz, p. 577-584.</ref> Kaplan Spitz argues that the punishment of the ''mamzer'' has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction. Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on ''mamzerut''.\n\n== Codes of Jewish law ==\n:'' The halakhic codes have influenced, and in turn, have been influenced by, the responsa; [[History of responsa in Judaism]] thus provides an informative complement to the below.''\nThe most important codifications of Jewish law include:\n* The Mishnah, composed by [[Judah haNasi|rabbi Judah the Prince]], in 200&nbsp;CE, as a basic outline of the state of the Oral Law in his time. This was the framework upon which the Talmud was based; the Talmud's [[dialectic]] analysis of the content of the Mishna (''[[gemara]]''; completed c.&nbsp;500) became the basis for all later [[posek|halakhic decisions]] and subsequent [[codification (law)|codes]].\n* [[Codification (law)|Codification]]s by the [[Geonim]] of the halakhic material in the Talmud. \n** An early work, ''She'iltot'' (\"Questions\") by [[Achai of Shabcha]] (c.&nbsp;752), discusses over 190 ''mitzvot'' \u2013 exploring and addressing various questions on these. \n** The first legal [[codex]] proper, ''Halakhot Pesukot'' (\"Decided Laws\"), by [[Yehudai Gaon]] (c.&nbsp;760), rearranges the Talmud passages in a structure manageable to the layman. (It was written in [[Aramaic language#Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic|vernacular Aramaic]], and subsequently translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as ''Hilkhot Riu''). \n** ''Halakhot Gedolot'' (\"Great Law Book\"), by R.[[Simeon Kayyara]], published two generations later, contains extensive additional material, mainly from [[Responsa]] and [[Monograph]]s of the Geonim, and is presented in a form that is closer to the original Talmud language and structure. (Probably since it was distributed, also, amongst the newly established [[Ashkenazi]] communities.) The ''She'iltot'' was influential on both subsequent works.\n* The [[Hilchot HaRif]], was written by the Rabbi [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013\u20131103), it has summations of the legal material found in the Talmud. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud's halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberation; he also excluded all aggadic (non-legal, and homiletic) matter. The ''Hilchot'' soon superseded the geonic codes, as it contained all the decisions and the laws then relevant, and additionally, served as an accessible Talmudic commentary; it has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The [[Mishneh Torah]] by [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204). This work encompasses the full range of Talmudic law; it is organized and reformulated in a logical system \u2013 in 14 books, 83 sections and 1000 chapters \u2013 with each ''halakha'' stated clearly. The Mishneh Torah is very influential to this day, and several later works reproduce passages verbatim. It also includes a section on [[Metaphysics]] and [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamental beliefs]]. (Some claim this section draws heavily on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] science and metaphysics; others suggest that it is within the tradition of [[Saadia Gaon]].) It is the main source of practical ''halakha'' for many [[Yemenite Jews]] \u2013 mainly [[Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] \u2013 as well as for a growing community referred to as ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|talmidei haRambam]]''.\n* The work of ''the Rosh'', rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (1250?/1259?\u20131328), an abstract of the Talmud, concisely stating the final halakhic decision and quoting later authorities, notably Alfasi, Maimonides, and the [[Tosafists]]. This work superseded rabbi Alfasi's and has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Gadol]]'' (The \"SeMaG\") of rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]] (first half of the 13th century, [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique|Coucy]], Northern France). \"SeMaG\" is organised around the 365 negative and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud (in light of the commentaries of [[Rashi]] and the [[Tosafot]]) and the other codes existent at the time. ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'' (\"SeMaK\") by [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]] is an abridgement of the ''SeMaG'', including additional practical ''halakha'', as well as agaddic and [[Musar literature|ethical]] material.\n* \"The Mordechai\" \u2013 by [[Mordecai ben Hillel]], d.&nbsp;[[Nuremberg]] 1298 \u2013 serves both as a source of analysis, as well of decided law. Mordechai considered about 350 halakhic authorities, and was widely influential, particularly amongst the Ashkenazi and [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] communities. Although organised around the ''Hilchot'' of ''the Rif'', it is, in fact, an independent work. It has been printed with every edition of the Talmud since 1482.\n[[File:Arba'ah Turim.jpg|thumb|200px|An illuminated manuscript of ''Arba'ah Turim'' from 1435.]]\n* The [[Arba'ah Turim]] (''The Tur'', lit. \"The Four Columns\") by rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] (1270\u20131343, [[Toledo, Spain]]). This work traces the ''halakha'' from the Torah text and the Talmud through the [[Rishonim]], with the ''Hilchot'' of Alfasi as its starting point. Ben Asher followed Maimonides's precedent in arranging his work in a topical order, however, the Tur covers only those areas of Jewish law that were in force in the author's time. The code is divided into four main sections; almost all codes since this time have followed the Tur's arrangement of material.\n** [[Orach Chayim]]: \"The Way of Life\" worship and ritual observance in the home and [[synagogue]], through the course of the day, the weekly sabbath and the festival cycle.\n** [[Yoreh De'ah]]: \"Teach Knowledge\" assorted ritual prohibitions, dietary laws and regulations concerning [[menstruation|menstrual]] impurity.\n** [[Even Ha'ezer]]: \"The Rock of the Helpmate\" [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and other issues in [[family]] law.\n** [[Choshen Mishpat]]: \"The Breastplate of Judgement\" The administration and [[adjudication]] of civil law.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch|Beit Yosef, and the Shulchan Aruch]] of rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (1488\u20131575). The ''Beit Yosef'' is a huge commentary on the ''Tur'' in which rabbi Karo traces the development of each law from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature (examining thirty-two [[posek|authorities]], beginning with the Talmud and ending with the works of rabbi [[Israel Isserlein]]). The Shulchan Aruch is, in turn, a condensation of the ''Beit Yosef'' \u2013 stating each ruling simply (literally translated, ''Shulchan Aruch'' means \"set table\"); this work follows the chapter divisions of the Tur. The Shulchan Aruch, together with its related commentaries, is considered by many to be the most authoritative compilation of ''halakha'' since the Talmud. In writing the Shulchan Aruch, rabbi Karo based his [[posek|rulings]] on three authorities \u2013 Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (Rif); he considered ''the Mordechai'' in inconclusive cases. [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]], generally, refer to the Shulchan Aruch as the basis for their daily practice.\n* The works of Rabbi [[Moshe Isserles]] (\"Rema\"; [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], 1525 to 1572). Isserles noted that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' was based on the [[Sephardic laws and customs|Sephardic]] tradition, and he created a series of [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to be appended to the text of the Shulkhan Aruch for cases where Sephardi and [[Ashkenazi]] [[minhag|customs]] differed (based on the works of [[Yaakov Moelin]], [[Israel Isserlein]], and [[Israel Bruna]]). The glosses are called ''Hamapah'' (\"the Tablecloth\"). His comments are now incorporated into the body of all printed editions of the Shulchan Aruch, typeset in a different script; today, \"Shulchan Aruch\" refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. Isserles' ''Darkhei Moshe'' is similarly a commentary on the Tur and the Beit Yosef.\n* The ''Levush Malkhut'' (\"Levush\") of Rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe]] (c. 1530\u20131612). A ten volume work, five discussing ''halakha'' at a level \"midway between the two extremes: the lengthy Beit Yosef of Karo on the one hand, and on the other Karo's Shulchan Aruch together with the Mappah of Isserles, which is too brief\", that particularly stresses the [[minhag|customs and practices]] of the Jews of Eastern Europe. The Levush was exceptional among the codes, in that it treated certain ''Halakhot'' from a Kabbalistic standpoint.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]] of Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (c. 1800) was an attempt to re-codify the law as it stood at that time \u2013 incorporating [[Shulchan Aruch#Major commentaries|commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch]], and [[History of Responsa#Acharonim|subsequent responsa]] \u2013 and thus stating the [[posek|decided ''halakha'']], as well as the underlying reasoning. The work was written partly so that laymen would be able to study Jewish law. Unfortunately, most of the work was lost in a fire prior to publication. It is the basis of practice for [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic groups]] and is quoted as authoritative by many subsequent works, Hasidic and non-Hasidic alike.\n* Works structured directly on the Shulchan Aruch, providing analysis in light of [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] material and codes:\n** The [[Mishnah Berurah]] of rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen]], (the \"Chofetz Chaim\", Poland, 1838\u20131933) is a commentary on the \"Orach Chayim\" section of the Shulchan Aruch, discussing the application of each ''halakha'' in light of all subsequent [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] decisions. It has become the authoritative halakhic guide for much of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Ashkenazic Jewry in the postwar period. \n** [[Aruch HaShulchan]] by rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] (1829\u20131888) is a scholarly analysis of ''halakha'' through the perspective of the major Rishonim. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch; rules dealing with vows, agriculture, and ritual purity, are discussed in a second work known as ''[[Aruch HaShulchan he'Atid]]''. \n** [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf HaChaim]] on [[Orach Chayim]] and parts of [[Yoreh De'ah]], by the Sephardi sage [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]] ([[Baghdad]] and [[Jerusalem]], 1870\u20131939) is similar in scope, authority and approach to the Mishnah Berurah. This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly [[Isaac Luria]]), when these impact the Halakha.\n** [[Yalkut Yosef]], by rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]], is a voluminous, widely cited and contemporary work of ''halakha'', based on the rulings of rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]].\n* [[Layman]]-oriented digests of ''halakha'': \n** The ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' of Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]] ([[Hungary]] 1804\u20131886), based on the very strict Hungarian customs of the 19th century, became immensely popular after its publication due to its simplicity. This work is not binding in the same way as the Mishneh Torah or the Shulchan Aruch. It is still popular in [[Orthodox Judaism]] as a framework for study, if not always for practice. \n** [[Chayei Adam]] and [[Chochmat Adam]] by [[Avraham Danzig]] (Poland, 1748\u20131820) are Ashkenazi works regarded as a more appropriate basis for practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} \n** The [[Ben Ish Chai]] by [[Ben Ish Hai|Yosef Chaim]] ([[Baghdad]], 1832\u20131909) is a collection of the laws on everyday life interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly [[Torah portion]]. Its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in Sephardi Halakha.\n** [[Eliezer Melamed#Published works|''Peninei Halachah'']] by Rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]] (15 volumes thus far) covers a wide range of subjects, from Shabbat to organ donations, and in addition to clearly posing the practical law - reflecting the customs of various communities - also discusses the spiritual foundations of the Halakhot.\n* ''Temimei Haderech'' (\"A Guide To Jewish Religious Practice\") by rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] with contributions from the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]].

Each character has special abilities called \"Skybound Arts,\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en|title=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames|website=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames}}</ref> which correspond to skills that the character is able to use in the main [[Granblue Fantasy]] game.  In an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players, each Skybound Arts can be triggered with a simple button press, but the player will have to wait for a short [[cooldown]] period before they can use it again.  However, if the player uses a more advanced combination of movement and button presses to launch the attack, the cooldown time on the skill will be shortened.\n\nThe game also contains a story mode. Unlike the main fighting game mode, the story mode will be more of a side-scrolling, [[beat-'em up]], [[action role-playing game]]. The story mode is slated to include exclusive bosses and minions to battle, setting weapon grids, and a co-op mode.<ref name=\"Granblue Extra Fes 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/jul/20/granblue-fantasy-versus-will-reportedly-receive-ton-new-information-granblue-extra-fes-2019-august-3/|title=Granblue Fantasy Versus will reportedly receive a ton of new information at Granblue Extra Fes 2019 on August 3|first=Dakota 'DarkHorse'|last=Hills|date=July 20, 2019|website=EventHubs}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Do not add Erika Harlacher yet.

fighting game where the goal is to eliminate the opponent by using a combination of attacks to empty their character's life bar enough times to win the match.  Each character has special abilities called \"Skybound Arts,\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en|title=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames|website=Granblue Fantasy: Versus &#124; Cygames}}</ref> which correspond to skills that the character is able to use in the main [[Granblue Fantasy]] game.  In an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players, each Skybound Arts can be triggered with a simple button press, but the player will have to wait for a short [[cooldown]] period before they can use it again.  However, if the player uses a more advanced combination of movement and button presses to launch the attack, the cooldown time on the skill will be shortened.\n\nThe game also contains a story mode. Unlike the main fighting game mode, the story mode will be more of a side-scrolling, [[beat-'em up]], [[action role-playing game]]. The story mode is slated to include exclusive bosses and minions to battle, setting weapon grids, and a co-op mode.<ref name=\"Granblue Extra Fes 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/jul/20/granblue-fantasy-versus-will-reportedly-receive-ton-new-information-granblue-extra-fes-2019-august-3/|title=Granblue Fantasy Versus will reportedly receive a ton of new information at Granblue Extra Fes 2019 on August 3|first=Dakota 'DarkHorse'|last=Hills|date=July 20, 2019|website=EventHubs}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Do not add Erika Harlacher yet.

However, after restoration work in 1904\u20131905, overpainting was removed and a hand with [[sheet music]] was revealed indicating that the sitter may be a musician, a theory that is widely accepted today.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ambrosiana.it/en/opere/portrait-of-a-musician |title=Portrait of a Musician Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana |accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\">Z\u00f6llner 2015, pp. 45</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart75\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 75</ref>\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary accounts or even records of a [[commission (art)|commission]] of any kind exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured at least a partial attribution to Leonardo. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff and rigid qualities of the figure of the body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have suggested that most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over the subject has caused the proposal of many italian musicians and politicians to be the young man's identity. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/l/leonardo/03/1musicia.html |author1=Kr\u00e9n, Emil |author2=Marx, Daniel |title=Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor in the time of the painting's creation. The portrait has a man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/> It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> \n\n===The Musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score.]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson237\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 237</ref> The man wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint|underpainted]] brown [[Academic stole|stole]].<ref name=\"Kemp\">Kemp 2019, pp.92</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart73\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 73</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Academic stole|stole]] has been referred to differently as brown<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> or orange,<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> creating an inconsistency that likely stems from its unfinished nature. So the most specific and inclusive term might be a \"brownish-orange.\"|group=n}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or perhaps the man about to sing or has just sung.<ref name=\"Pedretti\">Pedretti 1989, pp. 68</ref> A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. Both eyes are dilated but the left is to a far greater extent, something that is not humanly possible. Some propose this is simply for dramatic effect so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\nThe folded piece of paper is held in an odd and stiff way and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref> or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/> this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Pedretti\" /> The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"Oxford Art\"/> The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\"/> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.<ref name=\"Pooler31\">Pooler 2014, pp. 31</ref> Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.<ref name=\"Gaffurius Grove\"/><ref>Pooler 2014, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C.

She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}}<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> This theory has since been strongly discredited due to the notation in the painting being largely illegible and the fact that many composers of the time were writing the same forms in the same manner that was suggested to indicate specifically Josquin.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues\nas that of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making it unlikely to be him, a young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]], in the ''Portrait of a Musician''.<ref name=\"Josquin\"/>\n\n===Gaspar Van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested most recently in 2019 that the sitter's identity is, [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.<ref name=\"Fagnart76\"/> This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.<ref name= Fagnart76/>\n\n===Other Candidates===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freeart.com/artwork/art-print/leonardo-da-vinci-portrait-of-unknown_fan22837019.html |title=Leonardo da Vinci, portrait of unknown musician, perhaps Franchino Gaffurio or Galeazzo di Sanseverino.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.<ref name=\"Fagnart77\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commision a portrait himself.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n*{{cite magazine |last=Bambach |first=Carmen C. |date=2012 |title=\"Seeking the Universal Painter\" (review of exhibition, Leonardo, Painter at the Court of Milan, National Gallery, London) |url=https://www.academia.edu/4057518/Bambach_Seeking_the_Universal_Painter_review_of_exhibition_Leonardo_Painter_at_the_Court_of_Milan_National_Gallery_London_._Apollo_vol._175_no._595_Feb._2012_pp._82-85 |magazine= Apollo |location=London |publisher=Apollo |volume=175 |issue=595 |pages=82-83}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=David Alan |date=1983 |title=Leonardo and the Idealized Portrait in Milan |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43105426?seq=1 |journal=Arte Lombarda |volume=64 |pages= 105}}\n\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |author2=Martin Kemp |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=Penguin |year=1989 |ref=Clark |isbn=978-0140169829}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor2=Paul Kolb |title=Gaspar van Weerbeke.

Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured at least a partial attribution to Leonardo. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff and rigid qualities of the figure of the body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have suggested that besides the face, most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over the subject's identity has caused many italian musicians and politicians who were in Milan at the time to be proposed. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/l/leonardo/03/1musicia.html |author1=Kr\u00e9n, Emil |author2=Marx, Daniel |title=Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor in the time of the painting's creation. The portrait has a man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/> It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> \n\n===The Musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score.]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson237\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 237</ref> The man wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only [[underpaint|underpainted]] brown [[Academic stole|stole]].<ref name=\"Kemp\">Kemp 2019, pp.92</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart73\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 73</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Academic stole|stole]] has been referred to differently as brown<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> or orange,<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> creating an inconsistency that likely stems from its unfinished nature.

Both eyes are dilated but the left is to a far greater extent, something that is not humanly possible. Some propose this is simply for dramatic effect so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\nThe folded piece of paper is held in an odd and stiff way holds and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are larly illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso to have been done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref> or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/> this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Pedretti\" /> The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"Oxford Art\"/> The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before than are unknown but the portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was counterpart with the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which lead to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\"/> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.<ref name=\"Pooler31\">Pooler 2014, pp. 31</ref> Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> As well as, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young subject of the painting.<ref name=\"Gaffurius Grove\"/><ref>Pooler 2014, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C.

Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.<ref name=\"Fagnart76\"/> This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.<ref name= Fagnart76/>\n\n===Other Candidates===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freeart.com/artwork/art-print/leonardo-da-vinci-portrait-of-unknown_fan22837019.html |title=Leonardo da Vinci, portrait of unknown musician, perhaps Franchino Gaffurio or Galeazzo di Sanseverino.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is perhaps that of the Leonardo's proposed disappearance of the music after a finished performance.<ref name=\"Fagnart77\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commision a portrait himself.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n*{{cite magazine |last=Bambach |first=Carmen C. |date=2012 |title=\"Seeking the Universal Painter\" (review of exhibition, Leonardo, Painter at the Court of Milan, National Gallery, London) |url=https://www.academia.edu/4057518/Bambach_Seeking_the_Universal_Painter_review_of_exhibition_Leonardo_Painter_at_the_Court_of_Milan_National_Gallery_London_._Apollo_vol._175_no._595_Feb._2012_pp._82-85 |magazine= Apollo |location=London |publisher=Apollo |volume=175 |issue=595 |pages=82-83}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=David Alan |date=1983 |title=Leonardo and the Idealized Portrait in Milan |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43105426?seq=1 |journal=Arte Lombarda |volume=64 |pages= 105}}\n\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |author2=Martin Kemp |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=Penguin |year=1989 |ref=Clark |isbn=978-0140169829}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor2=Paul Kolb |title=Gaspar van Weerbeke.

These are the highest and second highest valor awards in the CIA. An award bestowing either of these citations represents the highest honors awarded within the CIA in recognition of distinguished valor and excellence in the line of duty. SAC/SOG operatives also account for the majority of the stars displayed on the [[CIA Memorial Wall|Memorial Wall at CIA headquarters]] indicating that the officer died while on active duty.<ref>Gup, Ted (2000). ''The Book of Honor: Cover Lives and Classified Deaths at the CIA''.</ref> The motto of SAC is '''Tertia Optio''', which means '''Third Option''', as covert action represents a third option within the realm of national security when diplomacy and military action are not feasible.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/about/#story | title=About | access-date=January 14, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115184355/https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/about/#story | archive-date=January 15, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe '''Political Action Group''' ('''PAG''') is responsible for covert activities related to political influence, [[Psychological warfare|psychological operations]], and [[economic warfare]]. The rapid development of technology has added [[cyberwarfare|cyber warfare]] to their mission. Tactical units within SAC are also capable of carrying out covert political action while deployed in hostile and austere environments. A large covert operation typically has components that involve many or all of these categories as well as paramilitary operations.\n\nPolitical and \"influence\" covert operations are used to support [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]]. Overt support for one element of an insurgency would often be counterproductive due to the impression it would potentially exert on the local population. In such cases covert assistance allows the US to assist without damaging these elements in the process.\n\n==Overview==\nSAC provides the [[United States National Security Council]] with alternative options when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible. SAC can be directly tasked by the president or the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] at the president's direction, unlike other U.S. special mission forces. SAC/SOG has far fewer members than most of the other special missions units, such as the [[U.S. Army]]'s 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta ([[Delta Force]]) or [[SEAL Team Six|Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU).<ref name='Southworth'>Southworth (2002)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |page=512 |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014953/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2008 }}</ref><ref name='Waller'>{{cite magazine |first=Waller |last=Douglas |date=February 3, 2003 |title=The CIA's Secret Army |magazine=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004145-1,00.html |access-date=January 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211120922/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004145-1,00.html |archive-date=February 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the action arm of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] Directorate of Operations, SAC/SOG conducts [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] missions such as [[raid (military)|raids]], [[ambush]]es, [[sabotage]], [[targeted killing]]s<ref>{{cite news |title=CIA Pakistan Campaign is Working Director Say |first=Mark |last=Mazzetti |author2=Helene Cooper |work=New York Times |date=February 26, 2009 |page=A15}}</ref><ref name=\"CIA Secret Program PM\">{{cite news |title=CIA Secret Program: PM Teams Targeting Al Qaeda |first=Greg |last=Miller |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 14, 2009 |page=A1 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/14/nation/na-cia-cheney14 |access-date=December 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517152012/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/14/nation/na-cia-cheney14 |archive-date=May 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=CIA Had Plan To Assassinate Qaeda Leaders |first=Mark |last=Mazzetti |author2=Shane Scott  |work=New York Times |date=July 14, 2009 |page=A1}}</ref> and [[unconventional warfare]] (e.g., training and leading [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and military units of other countries in combat).

These techniques have expanded to cover the internet as well. They may employ officers to work as journalists, recruit agents of influence, operate media platforms, plant certain stories or information in places it is hoped it will come to public attention, or seek to deny and/or discredit information that is public knowledge. In all such propaganda efforts, \"black\" operations denote those in which the audience is to be kept ignorant of the source; \"white\" efforts are those in which the originator openly acknowledges themselves; and \"gray\" operations are those in which the source is partly but not fully acknowledged.<ref name=\"americanforeignrelations.com\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/04/15/u-s-aggressiveness-towards-iran/|title=U.S. Aggressiveness towards Iran|work=Foreign Policy Journal|date=2010-04-15|access-date=July 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618090520/http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/04/15/u-s-aggressiveness-towards-iran/|archive-date=June 18, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of political action programs were the prevention of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) from winning elections between 1948 and the late 1960s; overthrowing the governments of [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iran in 1953]] and [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|Guatemala in 1954]]; arming rebels in Indonesia in 1957; and providing funds and support to the [[trade union]] federation [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] following the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]] after 1981.<ref>Daugherty (2004), p. 83</ref>\n\nSAC's existence became better known as a result of the \"[[War on Terror]]\".

The primary strengths of SAC Paramilitary Officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/> As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 and most importantly&nbsp;\u2013 to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]/[[unconventional warfare]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets.\n\nThere are four principal elements within SAC's Special Operations Group: the '''Air Branch''', the '''Maritime Branch''', the '''Ground Branch''', and the '''Armor and Special Programs Branch'''. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.\n\nTogether, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete [[combined arms]] covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.<ref name=\"so\"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA24&dq=special+ops:+america%27s+elite+forces+delta+the+best+period#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat |author= Fred J.

Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like its successor, the CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.\n\nOne of the OSS' greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |title=Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network\n |accessdate=2008-08-14\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814145107/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |archivedate=August 14, 2008\n |df=mdy\n}}, CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>\n\nOSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].\n\nOSS was disbanded shortly after [[World War II]], with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] of the CIA. In 1962, the paramilitary operations of CIA centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of SAC. The direct descendant of the OSS' Special Operations is the CIA's Special Activities Division.\n\n===Tibet===\n{{Main|CIA Tibetan program}}\nAfter the Chinese invasion of Tibet in October 1950, the CIA inserted paramilitary (PM) teams into Tibet to train and lead [[Tibetan resistance]] fighters against the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China.

By 1970, communist plans repeatedly emphasized attacking the government's \"pacification\" program and specifically targeted Phoenix agents. The NLF also imposed quotas. In 1970, for example, communist officials near [[Da Nang]] in northern South Vietnam instructed their agents to \"kill 400 persons\" deemed to be government \"tyrant[s]\" and to \"annihilate\" anyone involved with the \"pacification\" program. Several North Vietnamese officials have made statements about the effectiveness of Phoenix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr06/Andrade-Willbanks.pdf|title=US Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth|website=army.mil|accessdate=January 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625022447/http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr06/Andrade-Willbanks.pdf|archive-date=June 25, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>^ Colby, William; Peter Forbath (1978) (extract concerning Gladio stay-behind operations in Scandinavia).

Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Draper |title=A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8090-9613-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/verythinlineiran00drap }}</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |year=1987 |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981\u20131987 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-60117-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilsecretwarsof0000wood |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990.<ref name='Woodward 1987'/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Riesenfeld |first=Stefan A. |year=1987 |title=The Powers of Congress and the President in International Relations: Revisited |journal=[[California Law Review]] |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=405\u201314 |jstor=3480586 |doi=10.2307/3480586 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |access-date=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427220228/https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |archive-date=April 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Sandinista]] leader [[Daniel Ortega]] was re-elected as President of [[Nicaragua]] in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.\n\n===El Salvador===\nCIA personnel were also involved in the [[Salvadoran civil war]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uXCpB-D0LLEC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=cia+el+salvador|title=Killer Elite|author=Michael Smith|page=52|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007 | isbn=978-0-312-36272-0}}</ref>  Some allege that the techniques used to interrogate prisoners in El Salvador foreshadowed those later used in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|title=Prisoner Abuse: Patterns from the Past|author1=Thomas Blanton|author2=Peter Kornbluh|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=December 5, 2004|access-date=March 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124020135/http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|archive-date=November 24, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> In fact, when a similar counter-insurgency program was proposed in Iraq, it was referred to as \"the Salvador Option\".

The rapid development of technology has added [[cyberwarfare|cyber warfare]] to their mission. Tactical units within SAC are also capable of carrying out covert political action while deployed in hostile and austere environments. A large covert operation typically has components that involve many or all of these categories as well as paramilitary operations.\n\nPolitical and \"influence\" covert operations are used to support [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]]. Overt support for one element of an insurgency would often be counterproductive due to the impression it would potentially exert on the local population. In such cases covert assistance allows the US to assist without damaging these elements in the process.\n\n==Overview==\nSAC provides the [[United States National Security Council]] with alternative options when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible. SAC can be directly tasked by the president or the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] at the president's direction, unlike other U.S. special mission forces.

The primary strengths of SAC Paramilitary Officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/> As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 and most importantly&nbsp;\u2013 to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]/[[unconventional warfare]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets.\n\nThere are four principal elements within SAC's Special Operations Group: the '''Air Branch''', the '''Maritime Branch''', the '''Ground Branch''', and the '''Armor and Special Programs Branch'''. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.\n\nTogether, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete [[combined arms]] covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.<ref name=\"so\"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments.

Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like its successor, the CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.\n\nOne of the OSS' greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |title=Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network\n |accessdate=2008-08-14\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814145107/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |archivedate=August 14, 2008\n |df=mdy\n}}, CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>\n\nOSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].\n\nOSS was disbanded shortly after [[World War II]], with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] of the CIA. In 1962, the paramilitary operations of CIA centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of SAC. The direct descendant of the OSS' Special Operations is the CIA's Special Activities Division.\n\n===Tibet===\n{{Main|CIA Tibetan program}}\nAfter the Chinese invasion of Tibet in October 1950, the CIA inserted paramilitary (PM) teams into Tibet to train and lead [[Tibetan resistance]] fighters against the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China.

These activities included maritime operations behind North Korean lines. Yong Do Island, connected by a rugged isthmus to [[Pusan]], served as the base for those operations. These operations were carried out by well-trained Korean guerrillas. The four principal U.S. advisers responsible for the training and operational planning of those special missions were Dutch Kramer, Tom Curtis, George Atcheson and Joe Pagnella.

Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Draper |title=A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8090-9613-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/verythinlineiran00drap }}</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |year=1987 |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981\u20131987 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-60117-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilsecretwarsof0000wood |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990.<ref name='Woodward 1987'/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Riesenfeld |first=Stefan A. |year=1987 |title=The Powers of Congress and the President in International Relations: Revisited |journal=[[California Law Review]] |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=405\u201314 |jstor=3480586 |doi=10.2307/3480586 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |access-date=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427220228/https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |archive-date=April 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Sandinista]] leader [[Daniel Ortega]] was re-elected as President of [[Nicaragua]] in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.\n\n===El Salvador===\nCIA personnel were also involved in the [[Salvadoran civil war]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uXCpB-D0LLEC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=cia+el+salvador|title=Killer Elite|author=Michael Smith|page=52|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007 | isbn=978-0-312-36272-0}}</ref>  Some allege that the techniques used to interrogate prisoners in El Salvador foreshadowed those later used in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|title=Prisoner Abuse: Patterns from the Past|author1=Thomas Blanton|author2=Peter Kornbluh|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=December 5, 2004|access-date=March 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124020135/http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|archive-date=November 24, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> In fact, when a similar counter-insurgency program was proposed in Iraq, it was referred to as \"the Salvador Option\".

Operatives Killed In an Ambush in Afghanistan |quote=After (Chief) Carlson's death, he soon became a legend among his current peers from the same organizations. Very little has been documented, due to operational security requirements at such a high level, but what has been known by many who have studied his life was that he was possibly one of the most unique and memorable assets/operators (with SAD (SOG), as well as when in Delta, or TF Green as they were last referred to. His awards, as one former Delta operator once quietly said, were not, and would never be, worthy of his heroism in the face of an overwhelming force during the time of the ambush and the past engagements and operations he has been apart of that have become milestones in history, from Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and up to his death. Rumors later surfaced that those responsible for killing the former SEAL and Chief were dealt with rapidly, but as with so many near mythical heroes in U.S. Special Operations (especially retiring Tier 1 operators), it remains a loss for the families who luckily have had some support from the SOF community, and foundations have been established.|work=The New York Times|date=October 29, 2003|accessdate=May 19, 2011|first=Douglas|last=Jehl}}</ref> In Oliver North's book ''American Heroes in Special Operations'', a chapter is devoted to their story.<ref name=\"North2010\">{{cite book|last=North|first=Oliver|title=American Heroes in Special Operations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CODVISdxxssC|accessdate=3 February 2014|year=2010|publisher=B&H Publishing Group|isbn=9780805447125|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108000044/https://books.google.com/books?id=CODVISdxxssC|archive-date=January 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable political action officers==\n* [[Virginia Hall]] (1906\u20131982) Goillot started as the only female paramilitary officer in the OSS.

She was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. She married an OSS officer named Paul Goillot and the two joined the CIA as paramilitary operations officers in SAD. Once aboard, Mrs. Goillot made her mark as a political action officer playing significant roles in the Guatemala and Guyana operations.

His father Richard Kilpatrick was a [[United States Air Force]] enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick worked as a waitress and a dancer. Diane had her first son when she was only 15 years old. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without the supervision or guidance of his parents, ended up getting into many fights. Shamrock's father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five years old. His mother, Diane Kilpatrick, married an Army aviator named Bob Nance. The newly formed family moved to [[Napa, California]], Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent, they continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who had fought in the Vietnam War, became a member of the local [[fire department]] and also found work in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved and excelled in sports at a young age, playing in [[Little League]] baseball and [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using [[heroin]] [[intravenously]], but who also played football.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\">{{cite web|last=Uribe|first=Eric|url=http://ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck|title=Ken Shamrock profile|publisher=ericuribe/com|accessdate=August 11, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622023017/http://ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck/|archivedate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. Shamrock, at the age of 13, was then kicked out of his home by his stepfather, and each of the brothers went their separate ways. Shamrock lived in cars as a result before being placed in a foster home.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8coM29QvSSY Save our children: Ken Shamrock at TEDxSalford]. YouTube (December 24, 2012). Retrieved on 2013-09-05.</ref> He went through seven group homes and ended up serving time in a [[juvenile hall]]. He bounced around between several group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14, in [[Susanville, California]] where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor. He then joined the Coast Guard shortly before knocking out Kevin \"The Hitman\" Harlee.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/>\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in both football and wrestling. As a senior, Shamrock qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/> Shamrock did not receive scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors orders, Shamrock joined the [[Shasta College]] football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/> The [[San Diego Chargers]] of the [[National Football League]] later offered Shamrock a tryout, but Shamrock declined in order to pursue a career in [[professional wrestling]], where he debuted in 1989 in the [[South Atlantic Pro Wrestling]] promotion.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131997)===\nIn 1988, Shamrock trained as a professional wrestler under [[Buzz Sawyer]], Nelson Royal, and [[Gene Anderson]].<ref name=\"Wall2005\"/><ref name=\"ShamrockKrauss2012\"/> He debuted in 1989 in Royal's North Carolina-based Atlantic Coast Wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] under the [[ring name]] Wayne Shamrock. After ACW folded, he moved on to the George Scott/Paul Jones-run company [[South Atlantic Pro Wrestling]] (which initially promoted under the banner of the North American Wrestling Association) and changed his ring name to Vince Torelli. Later he adopted the nickname \"Mr. Wrestling\" and a more villainous persona.\n\n===Japan (1990\u20131993)===\nIn June 1990, after being inspired by [[Dean Malenko]], Shamrock applied for the American tryouts of Japanese [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] in Florida.

Shamrock's feud with Vader continued in Japan, through a working agreement between the WWF and FMW, Shamrock wrestled Vader in an Ultimate Rules Steel Cage match for FMW's Kawasaki Legend 1997 super show featuring 4 other promotions. The match ended in a TKO win for Vader as Shamrock was suffering from internal bleeding from a lung infection and a rib injury.\n\nShamrock's rivalry with the Harts led to his first WWF pay-per-view main event at [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]], and culminated in a bout between him and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]] at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] which Shamrock lost by disqualification after hitting the Bulldog with a can of dog food. Shamrock went on to wrestle Bret Hart to a no-contest in a match for the latter's [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] on the edition of October 21 of ''Raw''. He again challenged for the WWF Championship in the main event of December's [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], defeating champion [[Shawn Michaels]] by disqualification when [[Triple H]] interfered.\n\nThroughout early 1998, Shamrock feuded with [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and his [[Nation of Domination]] stable. He lost to Rock via disqualification at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] and a victory over him at [[WrestleMania XIV]] was reversed after Shamrock continued to apply his ankle lock after The Rock had submitted.\n\nIn June 1998, Shamrock competed in the [[King of the Ring (1998)|1998]] [[King of the Ring tournament]], eliminating Nation members [[Mark Henry]], [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Kama]] and The Rock, as well as [[Jeff Jarrett]], to win the tournament. Following the King of the Ring, Shamrock feuded briefly with the returning [[Nelson Frazier, Jr|King Mabel]], who had interfered to attack him in a rematch with Jarrett, and whom Shamrock defeated in a singles match injuring his leg.<ref name=Slash1>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980706.html|title=Raw 6 July 1998|work=Slashwrestling|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> He next feuded with [[Owen Hart]]: Hart defeated Shamrock in a \"[[Hart Dungeon|Hart Family Dungeon]] match\" at [[WWF Fully Loaded#1998|Fully Loaded]], and Shamrock defeated Hart in a \"[[Professional wrestling match types#Lion's Den match|Lion's Den match]]\" at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]].

The duo held the titles until January 25, 1999, when they lost to Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart.\n\nIn January 1999, Shamrock began feuding with [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]], [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]] and [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]], all of whom had made overtures to his [[kayfabe]] sister, [[Alicia Webb|Ryan]]. He lost the Intercontinental Championship to Venis on February 14 at [[WWF St. Valentine's Day Massacre|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] when Gunn, the guest referee, delivered a fast count. Shamrock took part in a [[Three Way Dance|four way bout]] for the Intercontinental Championship at [[WrestleMania XV]]. The reigning champion [[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]], was able to retain his title by pinning Goldust after Shamrock and Venis were counted out while brawling outside the ring.\n\nIn early mid-1999, the Corporation began feuding with [[The Undertaker]] and his [[Ministry of Darkness]], with The Undertaker's minions repeatedly ambushing Shamrock and kidnapping Ryan, sacrificing her on the Undertaker's symbol. After breaking away from the Corporation, thus turning face once more, Shamrock went on to feud with The Undertaker at [[Backlash: In Your House|Backlash]] and lost.\n\nAfter losing to Undertaker, Shamrock, [[Big Show]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] formed [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], a stable of wrestlers in opposition to the [[Corporate Ministry]]. The Union dissolved soon after defeating the Corporate Ministry at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]] in May. Shamrock briefly feuded with Jeff Jarrett before beginning a rivalry with martial artist [[Steve Blackman]] that saw he and Blackman fight one another in a series of unorthodox matches. The feud ended at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], where Shamrock defeated Blackman in a \"Lion's Den weapons match\". He went on to feud with the newly debuted [[Chris Jericho]] until departing the WWF in late 1999 in order to resume his mixed martial arts career. His departure was attributed [[kayfabe|on screen]] to an injury inflicted by Jericho's bodyguard, [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]]. Shamrock has since appeared in the video games ''[[WWF SmackDown!

On the inaugural TNA pay-per-view on June 19, Shamrock won the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in a [[Gauntlet for the Gold]] match and is recognized as TNA's first ever World Champion.

On October 4, 1992, at the [[Tokyo Dome]], a legitimate match between \"Wayne Shamrock\" (Shamrock's [[ring name]] in Japan) and kickboxer [[Don Nakaya Nielsen]] took place.<ref name=\"meltzer2008\">{{cite web|last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dd-shamrockmoments092908&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Ken Shamrock's greatest hits|publisher=Yahoo Sports |accessdate=March 13, 2011|date=September 29, 2008}}</ref> Shamrock submitted Nielsen in 45 seconds, first threatening him with a [[rear naked choke]] and then locking a [[neck crank]]/[[Armlock|keylock]] combination for the win.<ref name=Rich2/> The success of this match made young professional wrestlers Shamrock, [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Minoru Suzuki]] question what they had been told since entering into predetermined wrestling: that nobody would ever pay to see real matches.<ref name=\"meltzer2008\"/> Shamrock, Funaki and Suzuki then founded a group of professional wrestlers and decided to pursue marketable legitimate matches. They formed a [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] called [[Pancrase]].<ref name=\"meltzer2008\"/>\n\n===Pancrase Hybrid Wrestling (1993\u20131996)===\nShamrock made his mixed martial arts debut at Pancrase on September 21.

According to Shamrock, he was asked by Pancrase management not to injure Suzuki during the match, as the Japanese was already affected by a back injury.<ref name=Rich4/> However, during the match Suzuki refused to release a [[kneebar]] after Shamrock had grabbed the ropes to escape, which injured the American's leg and forced him to forfeit the fight. The incident angered Shamrock, but there were no consequences.<ref name=Rich4/>\n\nHis ninth match, against [[Matt Hume]], would be a controversial one too. The bout was finished by Shamrock performing a professional wrestling [[Suplex#Northern lights suplex|northern lights suplex]] floated over into a Kimura lock, and was widely considered to be a [[worked shoot]]. When Shamrock was asked about the matter in 1998, he revealed that Hume and him had agreed to work the match in an exhibition format.<ref name=Rich4>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/japans-rich-mma-history-the-ken-shamrock-interview-part-4-of-7|title=Japan's Rich MMA History: The Ken Shamrock Interview, Part 4 of 7|author=Chris Palmquist|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=Mixedmartialarts.com |date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> Later, in 2015, he would answer to a similar question: \"I talked to Matt and I said that we would go in with each other but I wouldn't hurt him.

Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.\n\nOn September 8, 1995, at ''[[UFC 7]]'', Shamrock successfully defended the UFC Superfight Championship against [[UFC 6|UFC 6 Tournament Champion]] \"The Russian Bear\" [[Oleg Taktarov]]. Shamrock stated in his autobiography that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the [[Lion's Den (mixed martial arts)|Lion's Den]] and he did not wish to injure his friend and teammate. In ''Beyond the Lion's Den'', Shamrock states; \"In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would be a while before he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, I could get a referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned out fine. I battered him around for the duration of the match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase.\"\n\nShamrock then defended his belt against [[Kimo Leopoldo]] at ''[[UFC 8]]'' in February 1996 in [[Puerto Rico]]. In the bout, Shamrock secured a kneebar, forcing Kimo to submit. With the win, Shamrock defended his UFC Superfight title for the second time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AjCzWn471lRrbeCS6Z9.rAaMFI14?slug=ys-ufccountdown050809 |title=Relive UFC history |publisher=Yahoo Sports|date= |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====The Dance in Detroit====\nShamrock was then scheduled to face number one contender and rival [[Dan Severn]] at ''[[UFC 9]]'' in a rematch of their fight at ''UFC 6'', which Shamrock won by [[guillotine choke]] in 2:14. Their rematch at UFC 9 was marketed as the \"Clash of the Titans 2\" and took place in the [[Cobo Center|Cobo Arena]] in Detroit, Michigan, in Severn's home state.\n\nUFC owner [[Bob Meyrowitz]], referee [[John McCarthy (mixed martial arts)|John McCarthy]] and a team of lawyers were in court until 4:30&nbsp;p.m. on the day of the fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> An ultimatum was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a [[Tear of meniscus|torn lateral meniscus]], a partially torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]], a broken nose, and cracked ribs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/86 |title=10 YEARS OF UFC: Ken Shamrock |publisher=Blackbeltmag.com |date=February 11, 1964 |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822085251/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/86 |archivedate=August 22, 2009 }}</ref> His injuries, combined with the rule change, meant he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him.<ref name=\"Wall, Jeremy p 10\"/><ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example.<ref>Inside the Lion's Den. Shamrock, Ken. Hanner, Richard</ref> If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial [[Monetary policy|monetary]] damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/>\n\nIn a fight that would be called \"The Dance in Detroit\", both Severn and Shamrock circled each other with little to no contact for a combined total of almost thirty minutes. \"I took the center of the ring understanding that I was going to be fighting for my life and Dan never came at me,\" Shamrock said.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> Severn later said that his strategy was purposely not to engage with Shamrock and wait for the fans to boo, hoping that the booing would affect Shamrock psychologically and force him to make a mistake that Severn could capitalize on.<ref name=\"Wall, Jeremy p 10\"/> Finally, after over 15 minutes of stalling, Severn shot for a takedown, but was unsuccessful and following a brief scramble, Shamrock put Severn on his back in [[Mount (grappling)|full mount]]. Shamrock held the mount for close to five minutes, throwing open fist palm strikes to Severn's head and an occasional closed fist punch to the body. Shamrock felt as though he would have damaged Severn badly and perhaps finished him from this position of full mount had he been allowed to punch Severn in the face with a closed fist. Severn eventually gave his back in an attempt to get out and the risk paid off as Shamrock slid off Severn's back and onto his back in full guard. Severn landed a [[headbutt]] to open a cut above Shamrock's eye and followed with elbow strikes and punches from Shamrock's guard. Shamrock eventually got back to his feet and after six more minutes stalling, the fight went to a judges decision. The judges gave a split decision win to Dan Severn, which upset Shamrock because he felt as though Severn had broken the rules by utilizing the banned closed fist punches to the head and headbutts. Chants of \"boring!\" and \"Let's go [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]]!\" were echoed throughout the arena during the fight. Shamrock later stated that going through with this fight was the biggest regret of his fighting career.<ref>Ultimate Fighting Championship: Ultimate Shamrock [VHS]</ref>\n\nAfter taking time off away from the octagon to heal injuries, Shamrock entered the UFC's [[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]] in December 1996. Shamrock appeared as a guest on the mainstream American [[television]] program ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' to promote the event. [[Frank Shamrock]] served as Ken's head cornerman for the event. Shamrock's opponent in the quarterfinals of the tournament was Judo black belt, kickboxer, and [[Golden Gloves]] champion [[Brian Johnston (fighter)|Brian Johnston]]. Shamrock eventually tapped Johnston out with a forearm choke and advanced to the semifinals of the tournament. Shamrock, however, broke the same hand during this fight that kept him out of ''UFC 2'' and had to withdraw from the tournament.\n\nAfter ''[[UFC 9]]'', [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John McCain]] was successful in pulling UFC [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts from numerous cable systems, including [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI Cable]], which greatly hurt pay-per-view revenue. Combined with money drying out, the need to support his family and being burnt out from fighting, Shamrock left MMA for professional wrestling signing with the World Wrestling Federation.\n\n===Pride Fighting Championships (2000\u20132002, 2005)===\n====Pride Grand Prix 2000====\nOn January 30, 2000, at the [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round]], [[Guy Mezger]], one of Shamrock's fighters, fought [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], who at the time was considered to be one of the best [[pound for pound]] fighters in the world. Mezger took the fight on two weeks' notice and had a broken foot going into the fight. The contract that Mezger signed stipulated that the fight would be one 15 minute round with no overtime. The fight mostly consisted of Mezger controlling the fight by stopping Sakuraba's takedown attempts while landing strikes from the outside. The round ended and Mezger expected the fight to go to the judges, but Pride officials wanted the fight to go to overtime.\n\nAccording to Mezger, Pride did not like the outcome of the fight and changed the agreement/contract on the spot in order to give Sakuraba another chance to win the fight.<ref>[http://mmayou.com/news-and-exclusive-interviews-with-mmayou/37-fighters/219-guy-mezger-clarifies-previous-statement The Leading MMA You Site on the Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218063747/http://mmayou.com/news-and-exclusive-interviews-with-mmayou/37-fighters/219-guy-mezger-clarifies-previous-statement |date=February 18, 2009 }}.

Mezger was then ordered out of the ring and back to the locker room by Shamrock, who was livid at the decision to extend the fight because of Mezger's foot injury and the fact that he had taken the fight on short notice.\n\nMezger said, \"For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of energy for that 15 minutes, but I started to kind of wilt near the end. Then they called it a draw and I'm like, \"What?\" Everyone blames Ken for being unprofessional. Really, Ken was protecting his fighter.

Later I heard that Mezger's contract was only for a one-round fight. I thought, \"Ah, then it couldn't be helped.\" But Shamrock didn't have to get so angry like that. Seeing Mezger getting scolded by him, I felt sorry for (Mezger).\"<ref name=\"espn.go.com\"/>\n\nLater that night, the president of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, \"We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). We were able to get some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They wanted to make it right. One thing I said in the meeting was, \"Do you want me to call Kenny back in here and see what he says?\" \"No, no, no, no!\"<ref name=\"espn.go.com\"/>\n\nIn early 2000, Shamrock made a comeback to the mixed martial arts scene following his 4-year hiatus in the WWF. He signed with [[Pride Fighting Championships]] and defeated [[Alexander Otsuka]] by KO due to punches at the [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals]] in the superfight, his first fight back from the WWF. During the match Shamrock was able to totally knock out the tough Otsuka, a feat which renowned strikers like [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] and [[Wanderlei Silva]] failed to do. This was the first ever Pride event to be broadcast live in America<ref>Pride Grand Prix Finals: live event commentary</ref> and Pride strategically used Shamrock's drawing power in America by making his Superfight with Otsuka the co-headliner of the event.\n\n====Heavyweight division====\nOn August 27, 2000, Shamrock fought consensus top 10 [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] \"Ironhead\" [[Kazuyuki Fujita]] at [[2000 in Pride FC#Pride 10 - Return of the Warriors|Pride 10 - Return of the Warriors]]. Shamrock came into the fight with Fujita noticeably smaller than his previous fight with Otsuka, dropping roughly 15 pounds of weight. During the time before the fight, Shamrock was going through a divorce and had to take care of his young kids during the day, which severely cut into his training time for the fight. Despite this, Shamrock dominated Fujita throughout the entire fight, stopping takedowns from the Japanese wrestling champion and landing hard strikes, but eventually had his corner throw in the towel because he felt like he was having a heart attack. He was evaluated after the fight and it was determined that he was suffering from [[heart palpitation]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloodyknux.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27598 |title=One on One with Ken Shamrock |publisher=BloodyKnux.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708080115/http://bloodyknux.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27598 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2001, Shamrock was scheduled to fight [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] at [[2001 in Pride FC#Pride 13 - Collision Course|Pride 13 - Collision Course]], but re-injured his neck during training two weeks before the fight, the same serious neck injury that ended his WWF career.\n\nShamrock engaged in a feud with [[Don Frye]] during his career in the [[Pride Fighting Championships]], whose background was [[Don Frye]]'s trash talking. In 1999, [[Alicia Webb]] (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: \"I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, \"That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line.

Frye got the edge on a series of clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped down for an [[ankle lock]] and transitioned into both a [[Leglock#Kneebar|kneebar]] and a [[Leglock#Toe hold|toehold]], wrenching Frye's leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to tap out and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange. The bout moved to the mat, where Shamrock attempted another ankle lock, only for Frye to try to counter with one of his own and finally refusing to tap out by sheer will until the time ran out.

Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock's guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up, but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee [[Yuji Shimada]]. Shamrock got up following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions were mixed regarding the KO's legitimacy, though Ken's adopted brother and rival, [[Frank Shamrock|Frank]], stated to believe the stoppage was justified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/6/Sherdogs-Top-10-Matches-That-Were-Never-Made-46731|title=Sherdog Top 10: Matches That Were Never Made|work=[[Sherdog]]|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Return to UFC (2002\u20132006)===\n\n====Feud with Tito Ortiz====\n{{Main|Tito Ortiz vs. Ken Shamrock}}\nA feud between Shamrock's [[Lion's Den (mixed martial arts)|Lion's Den]] camp and [[Tito Ortiz]] began to build on January 8, 1999, at ''[[UFC 18]]''. After upsetting top UFC fighter and Lion's Den member [[Jerry Bohlander]], Ortiz mimicked shooting at Shamrock and put on a shirt in the octagon which read \"I just f**ked your ass\".\n\nOn March 5, 1999, at ''[[UFC 19]]'', after Ortiz won by referee stoppage in his rematch with [[Guy Mezger]], he immediately flipped off the Lion's Den corner and then put on a shirt that said \"Gay Mezger is my Bitch\". After Shamrock saw the shirt, he yelled into the octagon \"Hey Tito, don't let me see you wearing that shirt!\". Shamrock leaped onto the top of the cage, screaming at Ortiz and angrily waving his finger in Ortiz's face. Referee [[John McCarthy (mixed martial arts)|John McCarthy]] picked Ortiz up and carried him across the octagon to prevent the situation from escalating further. The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation.\n\nOn November 22, 2002, at ''[[UFC 40]]'', nearly four years after the confrontation at ''UFC 19'', Shamrock returned to the UFC to fight Ortiz in a title match for the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship]]. Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight for the first time and cut too much weight, weighing in at 201&nbsp;lbs, 4&nbsp;lbs under the 205&nbsp;lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book ''This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion''; \"Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter.

He also seriously contemplated retirement from MMA, citing the fact that he had never lost two fights in a row in his career before and he had a buildup of injuries.

However, Shamrock approached Ortiz and, after the two talked for several seconds, Shamrock said they could put all of their animosity aside as it was always \"just business\", shaking hands and burying the hatchet.

There, he is a [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|one-time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]], a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champion]] and the [[King of the Ring (1998)|1998]] [[King of the Ring tournament|King of the Ring]].

His father Richard Kilpatrick was a [[United States Air Force]] enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick worked as a waitress and a dancer. Diane had her first son when she was only 15 years old. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without the supervision or guidance of his parents, ended up getting into many fights. Shamrock's father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five years old. His mother, Diane Kilpatrick, married an Army aviator named Bob Nance. The newly formed family moved to [[Napa, California]], Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent, they continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who had fought in the Vietnam War, became a member of the local [[fire department]] and also found work in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved and excelled in sports at a young age, playing in [[Little League]] baseball and [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using [[heroin]] [[intravenously]], but who also played football.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\">{{cite web|last=Uribe|first=Eric|url=http://ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck|title=Ken Shamrock profile|publisher=ericuribe/com|accessdate=August 11, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622023017/http://ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck/|archivedate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. Shamrock, at the age of 13, was then kicked out of his home by his stepfather, and each of the brothers went their separate ways. Shamrock lived in cars as a result before being placed in a foster home.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8coM29QvSSY Save our children: Ken Shamrock at TEDxSalford]. YouTube (December 24, 2012). Retrieved on 2013-09-05.</ref> He went through seven group homes and ended up serving time in a [[juvenile hall]]. He bounced around between several group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14, in [[Susanville, California]] where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor. He then joined the Coast Guard shortly before knocking out Kevin \"The Hitman\" Harlee.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/>\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in both football and wrestling. As a senior, Shamrock qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/> Shamrock did not receive scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors orders, Shamrock joined the [[Shasta College]] football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/> The [[San Diego Chargers]] of the [[National Football League]] later offered Shamrock a tryout, but Shamrock declined in order to pursue a career in [[professional wrestling]], where he debuted in 1989 in the [[South Atlantic Pro Wrestling]] promotion.<ref name=\"ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck\"/>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131997)===\nIn 1988, Shamrock trained as a professional wrestler under [[Buzz Sawyer]], Nelson Royal, and [[Gene Anderson]].<ref name=\"Wall2005\"/><ref name=\"ShamrockKrauss2012\"/> He debuted in 1989 in Royal's North Carolina-based Atlantic Coast Wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] under the [[ring name]] Wayne Shamrock. After ACW folded, he moved on to the George Scott/Paul Jones-run company [[South Atlantic Pro Wrestling]] (which initially promoted under the banner of the North American Wrestling Association) and changed his ring name to Vince Torelli. Later he adopted the nickname \"Mr. Wrestling\" and a more villainous persona.\n\n===Japan (1990\u20131993)===\nIn June 1990, after being inspired by [[Dean Malenko]], Shamrock applied for the American tryouts of Japanese [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] in Florida. As it was a [[shoot style]] promotion, where real strikes and holds were used, Shamrock was put to spar legitimately against other participants, among them [[Bart Vale]].<ref name=Rich1>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/japans-rich-mma-history-the-ken-shamrock-interview-part-1-of-7|title=Japan's Rich MMA History: The Ken Shamrock Interview, Part 1 of 7|author=Chris Palmquist|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=Mixedmartialarts.com |date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> After passing another tryout in Japan, he was eventually accepted, and in October he had his debut match in UWF, wrestling under the name of \"Wayne Shamrock\" and defeating [[Yoji Anjo]].

On March 23, 1997, Shamrock, identified as Ken Shamrock and billed as \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\"\u2014a name given to him by [[ABC News]]\u2014refereed a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|submission match]] between [[Bret Hart]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] at [[WrestleMania 13]].<ref name=Encyclopedia/>\n[[File:WWE- Birmingham 200997 (16).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Shamrock (left) being interviewed by World Wrestling Federation commentator [[Jim Ross]] in 1997]]\nShamrock returned to the ring following WrestleMania, [[Squash match|squashing]] [[Vernon White (fighter)|Vernon White]] (one of his Lion's Den students) in his debut WWF match.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> He went on to [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], Bret Hart, and [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|The Hart Foundation]] throughout 1997. Shamrock's feud with Vader continued in Japan, through a working agreement between the WWF and FMW, Shamrock wrestled Vader in an Ultimate Rules Steel Cage match for FMW's Kawasaki Legend 1997 super show featuring 4 other promotions. The match ended in a TKO win for Vader as Shamrock was suffering from internal bleeding from a lung infection and a rib injury.\n\nShamrock's rivalry with the Harts led to his first WWF pay-per-view main event at [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]], and culminated in a bout between him and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]] at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] which Shamrock lost by disqualification after hitting the Bulldog with a can of dog food. Shamrock went on to wrestle Bret Hart to a no-contest in a match for the latter's [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] on the edition of October 21 of ''Raw''. He again challenged for the WWF Championship in the main event of December's [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], defeating champion [[Shawn Michaels]] by disqualification when [[Triple H]] interfered.\n\nThroughout early 1998, Shamrock feuded with [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and his [[Nation of Domination]] stable. He lost to Rock via disqualification at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] and a victory over him at [[WrestleMania XIV]] was reversed after Shamrock continued to apply his ankle lock after The Rock had submitted.\n\nIn June 1998, Shamrock competed in the [[King of the Ring (1998)|1998]] [[King of the Ring tournament]], eliminating Nation members [[Mark Henry]], [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Kama]] and The Rock, as well as [[Jeff Jarrett]], to win the tournament. Following the King of the Ring, Shamrock feuded briefly with the returning [[Nelson Frazier, Jr|King Mabel]], who had interfered to attack him in a rematch with Jarrett, and whom Shamrock defeated in a singles match injuring his leg.<ref name=Slash1>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980706.html|title=Raw 6 July 1998|work=Slashwrestling|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> He next feuded with [[Owen Hart]]: Hart defeated Shamrock in a \"[[Hart Dungeon|Hart Family Dungeon]] match\" at [[WWF Fully Loaded#1998|Fully Loaded]], and Shamrock defeated Hart in a \"[[Professional wrestling match types#Lion's Den match|Lion's Den match]]\" at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In September, he formed a short-lived [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|stable]] with [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].\n\n====The Corporation and The Union (1998\u20131999)====\n{{Main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation|The Corporation (professional wrestling)#The Union|l2=The Union}}\nShamrock turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in October 1998 and won the vacant Intercontinental Championship on October 12, defeating [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] in the finals of an [[WWE tournaments#WWF Intercontinental Championship tournament (1998)|eight-man tournament]]. In November, Shamrock joined [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon's]] [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] after McMahon offered him \"a family\" in exchange for his services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/981116.html|title=Raw 16 November 1998|work=Slashwrestling|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> On December 14, Shamrock and fellow Corporation member [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]] defeated the [[New Age Outlaws]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], making Shamrock a dual champion. The duo held the titles until January 25, 1999, when they lost to Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart.\n\nIn January 1999, Shamrock began feuding with [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]], [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]] and [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]], all of whom had made overtures to his [[kayfabe]] sister, [[Alicia Webb|Ryan]]. He lost the Intercontinental Championship to Venis on February 14 at [[WWF St. Valentine's Day Massacre|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] when Gunn, the guest referee, delivered a fast count. Shamrock took part in a [[Three Way Dance|four way bout]] for the Intercontinental Championship at [[WrestleMania XV]]. The reigning champion [[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]], was able to retain his title by pinning Goldust after Shamrock and Venis were counted out while brawling outside the ring.\n\nIn early mid-1999, the Corporation began feuding with [[The Undertaker]] and his [[Ministry of Darkness]], with The Undertaker's minions repeatedly ambushing Shamrock and kidnapping Ryan, sacrificing her on the Undertaker's symbol. After breaking away from the Corporation, thus turning face once more, Shamrock went on to feud with The Undertaker at [[Backlash: In Your House|Backlash]] and lost.\n\nAfter losing to Undertaker, Shamrock, [[Big Show]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] formed [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], a stable of wrestlers in opposition to the [[Corporate Ministry]]. The Union dissolved soon after defeating the Corporate Ministry at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]] in May. Shamrock briefly feuded with Jeff Jarrett before beginning a rivalry with martial artist [[Steve Blackman]] that saw he and Blackman fight one another in a series of unorthodox matches. The feud ended at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], where Shamrock defeated Blackman in a \"Lion's Den weapons match\". He went on to feud with the newly debuted [[Chris Jericho]] until departing the WWF in late 1999 in order to resume his mixed martial arts career. His departure was attributed [[kayfabe|on screen]] to an injury inflicted by Jericho's bodyguard, [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]]. Shamrock has since appeared in the video games ''[[WWF SmackDown! (video game)|WWF SmackDown!]]'', ''[[WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role]]'' (in [[Royal Rumble]] matches only), ''[[WWF No Mercy]]'', ''[[WWE '13]]'' and ''[[WWE 2K16]]''.\n\n===Independent circuit (2002\u20132013)===\nShamrock returned to professional wrestling in March 2002, refereeing a [[Ring of Honor]] match between [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] and [[Low Ki]].\n\nShamrock made an appearance in the [[Independent circuit|independent Wrestling]] company [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]] during their flagship annual event, [[Bloodymania III]], defeating [[Jimmy Jacobs]] with Dan Severn as the special guest referee.\n\nIn December 2013 at \"Amo del Hexagono\" in Costa Rica, he made his return by attacking [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] and challenging him to a match.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002)===\nIn May 2002, Shamrock signed a one-year deal with the newly formed [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) promotion. On the inaugural TNA pay-per-view on June 19, Shamrock won the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in a [[Gauntlet for the Gold]] match and is recognized as TNA's first ever World Champion. After feuding with [[Jerry Tuite|Malice]] for several weeks, Shamrock left TNA shortly after losing the title to [[R-Truth|Ron Killings]] on August 7.\n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2003\u20132004)===\nShamrock made two appearances for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) between 2003 and 2004.

On October 4, 1992, at the [[Tokyo Dome]], a legitimate match between \"Wayne Shamrock\" (Shamrock's [[ring name]] in Japan) and kickboxer [[Don Nakaya Nielsen]] took place.<ref name=\"meltzer2008\">{{cite web|last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dd-shamrockmoments092908&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Ken Shamrock's greatest hits|publisher=Yahoo Sports |accessdate=March 13, 2011|date=September 29, 2008}}</ref> Shamrock submitted Nielsen in 45 seconds, first threatening him with a [[rear naked choke]] and then locking a [[neck crank]]/[[Armlock|keylock]] combination for the win.<ref name=Rich2/> The success of this match made young professional wrestlers Shamrock, [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Minoru Suzuki]] question what they had been told since entering into predetermined wrestling: that nobody would ever pay to see real matches.<ref name=\"meltzer2008\"/> Shamrock, Funaki and Suzuki then founded a group of professional wrestlers and decided to pursue marketable legitimate matches. They formed a [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] called [[Pancrase]].<ref name=\"meltzer2008\"/>\n\n===Pancrase Hybrid Wrestling (1993\u20131996)===\nShamrock made his mixed martial arts debut at Pancrase on September 21. Using professional wrestling rules\u2014no closed fisted punching to the head and breaks on the ropes\u2014but fighting for real without predetermined finishes, Shamrock beat Funaki by arm-triangle choke in the main event of the first Pancrase show on September 21, 1993.<ref name=\"meltzer2008\"/> Shamrock considered this a big victory, as it had been the first time he beat Funaki in all his time as Funaki's apprentice,<ref name=\"ShamrockKrauss2012\"/> and the show attracted a sell-out audience of 7,000.<ref name=\"meltzer2008\"/>\n\nHe followed up with victories over [[Kazuo Takahashi|Yoshiki Takahashi]], Takaku Fuke and Andre Van Den Oetelaar, and was slated to fight co-founder Minoru Suzuki on January 19, 1994. According to Shamrock, he was asked by Pancrase management not to injure Suzuki during the match, as the Japanese was already affected by a back injury.<ref name=Rich4/> However, during the match Suzuki refused to release a [[kneebar]] after Shamrock had grabbed the ropes to escape, which injured the American's leg and forced him to forfeit the fight. The incident angered Shamrock, but there were no consequences.<ref name=Rich4/>\n\nHis ninth match, against [[Matt Hume]], would be a controversial one too. The bout was finished by Shamrock performing a professional wrestling [[Suplex#Northern lights suplex|northern lights suplex]] floated over into a Kimura lock, and was widely considered to be a [[worked shoot]]. When Shamrock was asked about the matter in 1998, he revealed that Hume and him had agreed to work the match in an exhibition format.<ref name=Rich4>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/japans-rich-mma-history-the-ken-shamrock-interview-part-4-of-7|title=Japan's Rich MMA History: The Ken Shamrock Interview, Part 4 of 7|author=Chris Palmquist|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=Mixedmartialarts.com |date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> Later, in 2015, he would answer to a similar question: \"I talked to Matt and I said that we would go in with each other but I wouldn't hurt him.

Both Gracie and Shamrock were upset at the sudden rule change. Shamrock and Gracie fought for the entire allotted time of 30 minutes along with 5 minutes of overtime before the match was declared a draw. Shamrock was not satisfied with his performance against Gracie, saying \"it's certainly not a win. You gain nothing (with a draw)\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Black Belt Magazine: March 1996.

The \"superfight\", a match presented as a fight between the \"best of the best\", was still the match that would determine the UFC champion and the tournament winner would be considered the #1 contender for the newly created [[List of UFC champions|UFC Superfight Championship]] (later replaced by the [[UFC Heavyweight Championship]] when weight categories were introduced to the UFC). Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got up and walked out of the door without explanation.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.\n\nOn September 8, 1995, at ''[[UFC 7]]'', Shamrock successfully defended the UFC Superfight Championship against [[UFC 6|UFC 6 Tournament Champion]] \"The Russian Bear\" [[Oleg Taktarov]]. Shamrock stated in his autobiography that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the [[Lion's Den (mixed martial arts)|Lion's Den]] and he did not wish to injure his friend and teammate. In ''Beyond the Lion's Den'', Shamrock states; \"In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would be a while before he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, I could get a referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned out fine. I battered him around for the duration of the match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase.\"\n\nShamrock then defended his belt against [[Kimo Leopoldo]] at ''[[UFC 8]]'' in February 1996 in [[Puerto Rico]]. In the bout, Shamrock secured a kneebar, forcing Kimo to submit. With the win, Shamrock defended his UFC Superfight title for the second time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AjCzWn471lRrbeCS6Z9.rAaMFI14?slug=ys-ufccountdown050809 |title=Relive UFC history |publisher=Yahoo Sports|date= |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====The Dance in Detroit====\nShamrock was then scheduled to face number one contender and rival [[Dan Severn]] at ''[[UFC 9]]'' in a rematch of their fight at ''UFC 6'', which Shamrock won by [[guillotine choke]] in 2:14. Their rematch at UFC 9 was marketed as the \"Clash of the Titans 2\" and took place in the [[Cobo Center|Cobo Arena]] in Detroit, Michigan, in Severn's home state.\n\nUFC owner [[Bob Meyrowitz]], referee [[John McCarthy (mixed martial arts)|John McCarthy]] and a team of lawyers were in court until 4:30&nbsp;p.m. on the day of the fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> An ultimatum was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a [[Tear of meniscus|torn lateral meniscus]], a partially torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]], a broken nose, and cracked ribs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/86 |title=10 YEARS OF UFC: Ken Shamrock |publisher=Blackbeltmag.com |date=February 11, 1964 |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822085251/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/86 |archivedate=August 22, 2009 }}</ref> His injuries, combined with the rule change, meant he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him.<ref name=\"Wall, Jeremy p 10\"/><ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example.<ref>Inside the Lion's Den. Shamrock, Ken. Hanner, Richard</ref> If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial [[Monetary policy|monetary]] damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/>\n\nIn a fight that would be called \"The Dance in Detroit\", both Severn and Shamrock circled each other with little to no contact for a combined total of almost thirty minutes. \"I took the center of the ring understanding that I was going to be fighting for my life and Dan never came at me,\" Shamrock said.<ref name=\"No Holds Barred: Evolution\"/> Severn later said that his strategy was purposely not to engage with Shamrock and wait for the fans to boo, hoping that the booing would affect Shamrock psychologically and force him to make a mistake that Severn could capitalize on.<ref name=\"Wall, Jeremy p 10\"/> Finally, after over 15 minutes of stalling, Severn shot for a takedown, but was unsuccessful and following a brief scramble, Shamrock put Severn on his back in [[Mount (grappling)|full mount]]. Shamrock held the mount for close to five minutes, throwing open fist palm strikes to Severn's head and an occasional closed fist punch to the body. Shamrock felt as though he would have damaged Severn badly and perhaps finished him from this position of full mount had he been allowed to punch Severn in the face with a closed fist. Severn eventually gave his back in an attempt to get out and the risk paid off as Shamrock slid off Severn's back and onto his back in full guard. Severn landed a [[headbutt]] to open a cut above Shamrock's eye and followed with elbow strikes and punches from Shamrock's guard. Shamrock eventually got back to his feet and after six more minutes stalling, the fight went to a judges decision. The judges gave a split decision win to Dan Severn, which upset Shamrock because he felt as though Severn had broken the rules by utilizing the banned closed fist punches to the head and headbutts. Chants of \"boring!\" and \"Let's go [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]]!\" were echoed throughout the arena during the fight. Shamrock later stated that going through with this fight was the biggest regret of his fighting career.<ref>Ultimate Fighting Championship: Ultimate Shamrock [VHS]</ref>\n\nAfter taking time off away from the octagon to heal injuries, Shamrock entered the UFC's [[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]] in December 1996. Shamrock appeared as a guest on the mainstream American [[television]] program ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' to promote the event. [[Frank Shamrock]] served as Ken's head cornerman for the event. Shamrock's opponent in the quarterfinals of the tournament was Judo black belt, kickboxer, and [[Golden Gloves]] champion [[Brian Johnston (fighter)|Brian Johnston]]. Shamrock eventually tapped Johnston out with a forearm choke and advanced to the semifinals of the tournament. Shamrock, however, broke the same hand during this fight that kept him out of ''UFC 2'' and had to withdraw from the tournament.\n\nAfter ''[[UFC 9]]'', [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John McCain]] was successful in pulling UFC [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts from numerous cable systems, including [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI Cable]], which greatly hurt pay-per-view revenue. Combined with money drying out, the need to support his family and being burnt out from fighting, Shamrock left MMA for professional wrestling signing with the World Wrestling Federation.\n\n===Pride Fighting Championships (2000\u20132002, 2005)===\n====Pride Grand Prix 2000====\nOn January 30, 2000, at the [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round]], [[Guy Mezger]], one of Shamrock's fighters, fought [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], who at the time was considered to be one of the best [[pound for pound]] fighters in the world. Mezger took the fight on two weeks' notice and had a broken foot going into the fight. The contract that Mezger signed stipulated that the fight would be one 15 minute round with no overtime. The fight mostly consisted of Mezger controlling the fight by stopping Sakuraba's takedown attempts while landing strikes from the outside. The round ended and Mezger expected the fight to go to the judges, but Pride officials wanted the fight to go to overtime.\n\nAccording to Mezger, Pride did not like the outcome of the fight and changed the agreement/contract on the spot in order to give Sakuraba another chance to win the fight.<ref>[http://mmayou.com/news-and-exclusive-interviews-with-mmayou/37-fighters/219-guy-mezger-clarifies-previous-statement The Leading MMA You Site on the Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218063747/http://mmayou.com/news-and-exclusive-interviews-with-mmayou/37-fighters/219-guy-mezger-clarifies-previous-statement |date=February 18, 2009 }}.

Mezger was then ordered out of the ring and back to the locker room by Shamrock, who was livid at the decision to extend the fight because of Mezger's foot injury and the fact that he had taken the fight on short notice.\n\nMezger said, \"For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of energy for that 15 minutes, but I started to kind of wilt near the end. Then they called it a draw and I'm like, \"What?\" Everyone blames Ken for being unprofessional. Really, Ken was protecting his fighter.

Seeing Mezger getting scolded by him, I felt sorry for (Mezger).\"<ref name=\"espn.go.com\"/>\n\nLater that night, the president of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, \"We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). We were able to get some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They wanted to make it right. One thing I said in the meeting was, \"Do you want me to call Kenny back in here and see what he says?\" \"No, no, no, no!\"<ref name=\"espn.go.com\"/>\n\nIn early 2000, Shamrock made a comeback to the mixed martial arts scene following his 4-year hiatus in the WWF. He signed with [[Pride Fighting Championships]] and defeated [[Alexander Otsuka]] by KO due to punches at the [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals]] in the superfight, his first fight back from the WWF. During the match Shamrock was able to totally knock out the tough Otsuka, a feat which renowned strikers like [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] and [[Wanderlei Silva]] failed to do. This was the first ever Pride event to be broadcast live in America<ref>Pride Grand Prix Finals: live event commentary</ref> and Pride strategically used Shamrock's drawing power in America by making his Superfight with Otsuka the co-headliner of the event.\n\n====Heavyweight division====\nOn August 27, 2000, Shamrock fought consensus top 10 [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] \"Ironhead\" [[Kazuyuki Fujita]] at [[2000 in Pride FC#Pride 10 - Return of the Warriors|Pride 10 - Return of the Warriors]]. Shamrock came into the fight with Fujita noticeably smaller than his previous fight with Otsuka, dropping roughly 15 pounds of weight. During the time before the fight, Shamrock was going through a divorce and had to take care of his young kids during the day, which severely cut into his training time for the fight. Despite this, Shamrock dominated Fujita throughout the entire fight, stopping takedowns from the Japanese wrestling champion and landing hard strikes, but eventually had his corner throw in the towel because he felt like he was having a heart attack. He was evaluated after the fight and it was determined that he was suffering from [[heart palpitation]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloodyknux.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27598 |title=One on One with Ken Shamrock |publisher=BloodyKnux.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708080115/http://bloodyknux.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27598 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2001, Shamrock was scheduled to fight [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] at [[2001 in Pride FC#Pride 13 - Collision Course|Pride 13 - Collision Course]], but re-injured his neck during training two weeks before the fight, the same serious neck injury that ended his WWF career.\n\nShamrock engaged in a feud with [[Don Frye]] during his career in the [[Pride Fighting Championships]], whose background was [[Don Frye]]'s trash talking. In 1999, [[Alicia Webb]] (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: \"I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, \"That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line.

Frye got the edge on a series of clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped down for an [[ankle lock]] and transitioned into both a [[Leglock#Kneebar|kneebar]] and a [[Leglock#Toe hold|toehold]], wrenching Frye's leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to tap out and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange.

Sakuraba rushed in to follow up, but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee [[Yuji Shimada]]. Shamrock got up following the KO and protested vigorously.

After upsetting top UFC fighter and Lion's Den member [[Jerry Bohlander]], Ortiz mimicked shooting at Shamrock and put on a shirt in the octagon which read \"I just f**ked your ass\".\n\nOn March 5, 1999, at ''[[UFC 19]]'', after Ortiz won by referee stoppage in his rematch with [[Guy Mezger]], he immediately flipped off the Lion's Den corner and then put on a shirt that said \"Gay Mezger is my Bitch\". After Shamrock saw the shirt, he yelled into the octagon \"Hey Tito, don't let me see you wearing that shirt!\". Shamrock leaped onto the top of the cage, screaming at Ortiz and angrily waving his finger in Ortiz's face. Referee [[John McCarthy (mixed martial arts)|John McCarthy]] picked Ortiz up and carried him across the octagon to prevent the situation from escalating further. The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation.\n\nOn November 22, 2002, at ''[[UFC 40]]'', nearly four years after the confrontation at ''UFC 19'', Shamrock returned to the UFC to fight Ortiz in a title match for the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship]]. Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight for the first time and cut too much weight, weighing in at 201&nbsp;lbs, 4&nbsp;lbs under the 205&nbsp;lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book ''This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion''; \"Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter. I was not intimidated by him, but I guess you can say I was a little bit afraid.\"<ref>This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion, by Tito Ortiz.

Right before Round 4 started, Shamrock's cornerman threw in the towel and Ortiz successfully defended the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAfter the fight was over, Shamrock revealed that he fought Ortiz with a torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]]. He also seriously contemplated retirement from MMA, citing the fact that he had never lost two fights in a row in his career before and he had a buildup of injuries.

However, Shamrock approached Ortiz and, after the two talked for several seconds, Shamrock said they could put all of their animosity aside as it was always \"just business\", shaking hands and burying the hatchet.

The Irgun is also referred to as '''Etzel''' ({{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc}}), an acronym of the Hebrew initials, or by the abbreviation IZL.\n\nThe Irgun policy was based on what was then called [[Revisionist Zionism]] founded by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]. According to [[Howard Sachar]], \"The policy of the new organization was based squarely on Jabotinsky's teachings: every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state\".<ref>[[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time'', pp. 265\u2013266</ref>\n\nTwo of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the [[King David Hotel bombing|bombing of the King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the [[Deir Yassin massacre]], carried out together with [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] on 9 April 1948.\n\nThe Irgun has been viewed as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts.<ref name=SshmidtFCPRIOT/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=J.

The Revisionist Movement made up a popular backing for the underground organization. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism, commanded the organization until he died in 1940. He formulated the general realm of operation, regarding ''[[Havlagah|Restraint]]'' and the end thereof, and was the inspiration for the organization overall. An additional major source of ideological inspiration was the poetry of [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]]. The symbol of the organization, with the motto \u05e8\u05e7 \u05db\u05da (only thus), underneath a hand holding a rifle in the foreground of a map showing both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] (at the time, both were administered under the terms of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]]), implied that force was the only way to \"liberate the homeland.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Thomas G.|title= Native vs. Settler: Ethnic Conflict in Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, and South Africa|year= 2000|publisher= Greenwood|page= 172|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&lpg=PA172&dq=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&pg=PA172#v=onepage&q=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe number of members of the Irgun varied from a few hundred to a few thousand. Most of its members were people who joined the organization's command,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} under which they carried out various operations and filled positions, largely in opposition to [[British law]]. Most of them were \"ordinary\" people, who held regular jobs, and only a few dozen worked full-time in the Irgun.\n\nThe Irgun disagreed with the policy of the [[Yishuv]] and with the [[World Zionist Organization]], both with regard to strategy and basic ideology and with regard to [[public relations|PR]] and military tactics, such as use of armed force to accomplish the Zionist ends, operations against the Arabs during the riots, and relations with the British mandatory government. Therefore, the Irgun tended to ignore the decisions made by the Zionist leadership and the Yishuv's institutions. This fact caused the elected bodies not to recognize the independent organization, and during most of the time of its existence the organization was seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as irresponsible, and its actions thus worthy of thwarting. Accordingly, the Irgun accompanied its armed operations with public-relations campaigns aiming to convince the public of the Irgun's way and the problems with the official political leadership of the Yishuv. The Irgun put out numerous advertisements, an underground newspaper and even ran the first independent Hebrew radio station \u2013 [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]].\n\n===Structure, command, and organization===\n{{Irgun Commanders}}\nAs members of an underground armed organization, Irgun personnel did not normally call Irgun by its name, but rather used other names. In the first years of its existence it was known primarily as ''Ha-Haganah Leumit''' (The National Defense), and also by names such as ''Haganah Bet'' (\"Second Defense\"), ''Irgun Bet'' (\"Second Irgun\"), the ''Parallel Organization'' and the ''Rightwing Organization''. Later on{{when|date=June 2016}} it became most widely known as \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05de\u05d3 (the Stand). The anthem adopted by the Irgun was \"Anonymous Soldiers\",<ref>http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/hayalim.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://84.95.150.80/~betarco/|title=\u05d3\u05e3 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4\u05d2\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05ea}}</ref> written by [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] who was at the time a commander in the Irgun. Later on Stern defected from the Irgun and founded [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and the song became the anthem of the Lehi. The Irgun's new anthem then became the third verse of the \"[[Shir Betar|Betar Song]]\", by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.\n\nThe Irgun gradually evolved from its humble origins into a serious and well-organized paramilitary organization. The movement developed a hierarchy of ranks and a sophisticated command-structure, and came to demand serious military training and strict discipline from its members. It developed clandestine networks of hidden arms-caches and weapons-production workshops, safe-houses, and training camps, along with a secret printing facility for propaganda posters. \n\nThe ranks of the Irgun were (in ascending order):\n\n*''Khayal'' = (Private)\n*''Segen Rosh Kvutza'', ''Segen'' (\"Deputy Group Leader\", \"Deputy\") = Assistant Squad Leader ([[Lance Corporal]])\n*''Rosh Kvutza'' (\"Group Leader\") = Squad Leader ([[Corporal]])\n*''Samal'' (\"Sergeant\") = Section Leader ([[Staff Sergeant|Sergeant]])\n*''Samal Rishon'' (\"Sergeant First Class\") = Brigade Leader ([[Sergeant First Class|Platoon Sergeant]])\n*''Rav Samal'' (\"Chief Sergeant\") = Battalion Leader ([[Master Sergeant]])\n*''Gundar Sheni'', ''Gundar'' (\"Commander Second Class\", \"Commander\") = District Commander ([[2nd Lieutenant]])\n*''Gundar Rishon'' (\"Commander First Class\") = Senior Branch Commander, Headquarters Staff ([[Lieutenant]]).\n\nThe Irgun was led by a High Command, which set policy and gave orders. Directly underneath it was a General Staff, which oversaw the activities of the Irgun. The General Staff was divided into a military and a support staff. The military staff was divided into operational units that oversaw operations and support units in charge of planning, instruction, weapons caches and manufacture, and first aid. The military and support staff never met jointly; they communicated through the High Command. Beneath the General Staff were six district commands: [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]]-[[Galilee]], [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern]], [[Sharon plain|Sharon]], and [[Samaria|Shomron]], each led by a district commander.<ref name=Bell>Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976)</ref> A local Irgun district unit was called a \"Branch\". A \"brigade\" in the Irgun was made up of three sections. A section was made up of two groups, at the head of each was a \"Group Head\", and a deputy. Eventually, various units were established, which answered to a \"Center\" or \"Staff\".\n\nThe head of the Irgun High Command was the overall commander of the organization, but the designation of his rank varied. During the revolt against the British, Irgun commander [[Menachem Begin]] and the entire High Command held the rank of ''Gundar Rishon''. His predecessors, however, had held their own ranks. A rank of Military Commander ([[Israel Defense Forces ranks|Seren]]) was awarded to the Irgun commander [[Yaakov Meridor]] and a rank of High Commander ([[Aluf]]) to [[David Raziel]]. Until his death in 1940, Jabotinsky was known as the \"Military Commander of the Etzel\" or the ''Ha-Matzbi Ha-Elyon'' (\"Supreme Commander\").\n\nUnder the command of Menachem Begin, the Irgun was divided into different corps:\n\n* ''Hayil Kravi'' (Combat Corps) \u2013 responsible for combat operations\n* ''Delek'' (\"Gasoline\") \u2013 the intelligence section; responsible for gathering and translating intelligence, and maintaining contact with local and foreign journalists\n* ''HAT'' (Planning Division) \u2013 responsible for planning activities\n* ''HATAM'' (Revolutionary Publicity Corps) \u2013 responsible for printing and disseminating propaganda\n\nThe Irgun's commanders planned for it to have a regular combat force, a reserve, and shock units, but in practice there were not enough personnel for a reserve or for a shock force.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nThe Irgun emphasized that its fighters be highly disciplined. Strict drill exercises were carried out at ceremonies at different times, and strict attention was given to discipline, formal ceremonies and military relationships between the various ranks. The Irgun put out professional publications on combat doctrine, weaponry, leadership, drill exercises, etc. Among these publications were three books written by David Raziel, who had studied military history, techniques, and strategy:<ref>Schindler, Colin:''Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right'', p. 190</ref>\n\n* ''The Pistol'' (written in collaboration with Avraham Stern)\n* ''The Theory of Training''\n* ''Parade Ground and Field Drill''\n\nA British analysis noted that the Irgun's discipline was \"as strict as any army in the world.\"<ref name=Hoffman>Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Irgun operated a sophisticated recruitment and military-training regime. Those wishing to join had to find and make contact with a member, meaning only those who personally knew a member or were persistent could find their way in. Once contact had been established, a meeting was set up with the three-member selection committee at a safe-house, where the recruit was interviewed in a darkened room, with the committee either positioned behind a screen, or with a flashlight shone into the recruit's eyes. The interviewers asked basic biographical questions, and then asked a series of questions designed to weed out romantics and adventurers and those who had not seriously contemplated the potential sacrifices. Those selected attended a four-month series of indoctrination seminars in groups of five to ten, where they were taught the Irgun's ideology and the code of conduct it expected of its members. These seminars also had another purpose - to weed out the impatient and those of flawed purpose who had gotten past the selection interview. Then, members were introduced to other members, were taught the locations of safe-houses, and given military training. Irgun recruits trained with firearms, hand grenades, and were taught how to conduct combined attacks on targets. Arms handling and tactics courses were given in clandestine training camps, while practice shooting took place in the desert or by the sea. Eventually, separate training camps were established for heavy-weapons training. The most rigorous course was the explosives course for bomb-makers, which lasted a year.<ref name=Bell/> The British authorities believed that some Irgun members enlisted in the Jewish section of the [[Palestine Police Force]] for a year as part of their training, during which they also passed intelligence.<ref name=Hoffman/> In addition to the Irgun's sophisticated training program, many Irgun members were veterans of the Haganah (including the [[Palmach]]), the [[British Armed Forces]], and Jewish partisan groups that had waged guerrilla warfare in Nazi-occupied Europe, thus bringing significant military training and combat experience into the organization.<ref name=Hoffman/> The Irgun also operated a course for its intelligence operatives, in which recruits were taught espionage, cryptography, and analysis techniques.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nOf the Irgun's members, almost all were part-time members. They were expected to maintain their civilian lives and jobs, dividing their time between their civilian lives and underground activities. There were never more than 40 full-time members, who were given a small expense stipend on which to live on.<ref name=Bell/> Upon joining, every member received an underground name. The Irgun's members were divided into cells, and worked with the members of their own cells. The identities of Irgun members in other cells were withheld. This ensured that an Irgun member taken prisoner could betray no more than a few comrades.\n\nIn addition to the Irgun's members in Palestine, underground Irgun cells composed of local Jews were established in [[Europe]] following [[World War II]]. An Irgun cell was also established in [[Shanghai]], home to many European-Jewish refugees. The Irgun also set up a Swiss bank account. Eli Tavin, the former head of Irgun intelligence, was appointed commander of the Irgun abroad.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn November 1947, the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] came to an end as the UN approved of the partition of Palestine, and the British had announced their intention to withdraw the previous month. As the British left and the [[1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] got underway, the Irgun came out of the underground and began to function more as a standing army rather an underground organization. It began openly recruiting, training, and raising funds, and established bases, including training facilities. It also introduced field communications and created a medical unit and supply service.<ref>Menachem Begin: ''The Revolt'', ch. 18, ''The Conquest of Jaffa''</ref><ref>Segal, Hagai: ''How My Grandmother Prevented A Civil War'' (2014)</ref>\n\nUntil World War II the group armed itself with weapons purchased in Europe, primarily [[Italy]] and [[Poland]], and smuggled to Palestine. The Irgun also established workshops that manufactured spare parts and attachments for the weapons. Also manufactured were land mines and simple hand grenades. Another way in which the Irgun armed itself was theft of weapons from the [[Palestine Police Force|British Police]] and military.\n\n==Prior to World War II==\n===Founding===\nThe Irgun's first steps were in the aftermath of the [[1929 Palestine riots|Riots of 1929]]. In the [[Jerusalem]] branch of the Haganah there were feelings of disappointment and internal unrest towards the leadership of the movements and the [[Histadrut]] (at that time the organization running the Haganah). These feelings were a result of the view that the Haganah was not adequately defending Jewish interests in the region. Likewise, critics of the leadership spoke out against alleged failures in the number of weapons, readiness of the movement and its policy of restraint and not fighting back. On April 10, 1931, commanders and equipment managers announced that they refused to return weapons to the Haganah that had been issued to them earlier, prior to the [[Nebi Musa]] holiday. These weapons were later returned by the commander of the Jerusalem branch, [[Avraham Tehomi]], a.k.a. \"Gideon\". However, the commanders who decided to rebel against the leadership of the Haganah relayed a message regarding their resignations to the [[Vaad Leumi]], and thus this schism created a new independent movement.\n\nThe leader of the new underground movement was [[Avraham Tehomi]], alongside other founding members who were all senior commanders in the Haganah, members of [[Hapoel Hatzair]] and of the Histadrut. Also among them was [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]], an activist in the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]]. This group was known as the \"Odessan Gang\", because they previously had been members of the ''Haganah Ha'Atzmit'' of Jewish [[Odessa]]. The new movement was named ''Irgun Tsvai Leumi'', (\"National Military Organization\") in order to emphasize its active nature in contrast to the Haganah. Moreover, the organization was founded with the desire to become a true military organization and not just a [[militia]] as the Haganah was at the time.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the Jerusalem group merged with other armed groups affiliated with [[Betar]]. The Betar groups' center of activity was in [[Tel Aviv]], and they began their activity in 1928 with the establishment of \"Officers and Instructors School of Betar\". Students at this institution had broken away from the Haganah earlier, for political reasons, and the new group called itself the \"National Defense\", \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea. During the riots of 1929 Betar youth participated in the defense of Tel Aviv neighborhoods under the command of Yermiyahu Halperin, at the behest of the Tel Aviv city hall. After the riots the Tel Avivian group expanded, and was known as \"The [[Right Wing]] Organization\".\n\nAfter the Tel Aviv expansion another branch was established in [[Haifa]]. Towards the end of 1932 the Haganah branch of [[Safed]] also defected and joined the Irgun, as well as many members of the [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] sports association. At that time the movement's underground newsletter, ''Ha'Metsudah'' (the Fortress) also began publication, expressing the active trend of the movement. The Irgun also increased its numbers by expanding draft regiments of Betar \u2013 groups of volunteers, committed to two years of security and pioneer activities. These regiments were based in places that from which stemmed new Irgun strongholds in the many places, including the settlements of [[Yesod HaMa'ala]], [[Mishmar HaYarden]], [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]], [[Metula]] and [[Nahariya]] in the north; in the center \u2013 [[Hadera]], [[Binyamina]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]] and [[Kfar Saba]], and south of there \u2013 [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Rehovot]] and [[Ness Ziona]]. Later on regiments were also active in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] (\"the Kotel Brigades\") among others. Primary training centers were based in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Qastina]] (by [[Kiryat Mal'akhi]] of today) and other places.\n\n===Under Tehomi's command===\n{{Main|1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine}}\n[[File:Tehomi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Avraham Tehomi]], the first Commander of the Irgun]]\nIn 1933 there were some signs of unrest, seen by the incitement of the local Arab leadership to act against the authorities. The strong British response put down the disturbances quickly. During that time the Irgun operated in a similar manner to the Haganah and was a guarding organization. The two organizations cooperated in ways such as coordination of posts and even intelligence sharing.\n\nWithin the Irgun, Tehomi was the first to serve as \"Head of the Headquarters\" or \"Chief Commander\". Alongside Tehomi served the senior commanders, or \"Headquarters\" of the movement. As the organization grew, it was divided into district commands.\n\nIn August 1933 a \"Supervisory Committee\" for the Irgun was established, which included representatives from most of the Zionist political parties. The members of this committee were [[Meir Grossman]] (of the Hebrew State Party), Rabbi [[Meir Bar-Ilan]] (of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Party]], either [[Immanuel Neumann]] or [[Yehoshua Supersky]] (of the [[General Zionists]]) and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] or [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]] (of [[Hatzohar]]).\n\nIn protest against, and with the aim of ending [[Jewish immigration to Palestine]], the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Arab Revolt of 1936\u20131939]] broke out on April 19, 1936. The riots took the form of attacks by Arab rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vandalism. In the beginning, the Irgun and the Haganah generally maintained a policy of restraint, apart from a few instances. Some expressed resentment at this policy, leading up internal unrest in the two organizations. The Irgun tended to retaliate more often, and sometimes Irgun members patrolled areas beyond their positions in order to encounter attackers ahead of time. However, there were differences of opinion regarding what to do in the Haganah, as well. Due to the joining of many [[Betar]] Youth members, Jabotinsky (founder of Betar) had a great deal of influence over Irgun policy. Nevertheless, Jabotinsky was of the opinion that for moral reasons violent retaliation was not to be undertaken.\n\nIn November 1936 the [[Peel Commission]] was sent to inquire regarding the breakout of the riots and propose a solution to end the Revolt. In early 1937 there were still some in the [[Yishuv]] who felt the commission would recommend a partition of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]), thus creating a Jewish state on part of the land. The Irgun leadership, as well as the \"Supervisory Committee\" held similar beliefs, as did some members of the Haganah and the [[Jewish Agency]]. This belief strengthened the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]] and led to the position that there was no room for defense institutions in the future Jewish state. Tehomi was quoted as saying: \"We stand before great events: a Jewish state and a Jewish army. There is a need for a single military force\". This position intensified the differences of opinion regarding the policy of restraint, both within the Irgun and within the political camp aligned with the organization. The leadership committee of the Irgun supported a merger with the Haganah. On April 24, 1937 a referendum was held among Irgun members regarding its continued independent existence. David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern came out publicly in support for the continued existence of the Irgun:\n:''The Irgun has been placed ... before a decision to make, whether to submit to the authority of the government and the [[Jewish Agency]] or to prepare for a double sacrifice and endangerment. Some of our friends do not have appropriate willingness for this difficult position, and have submitted to the Jewish Agency and has left the battle ... all of the attempts ... to unite with the leftist organization have failed, because the Left entered into negotiations not on the basis of unification of forces, but the submission of one such force to the other....''<ref>[[Yosef Kister]], ''The Etzel'', (Hebrew) pp. 38</ref>\n\n===The first split===\nIn April 1937 the Irgun split after the referendum. Approximately 1,500\u20132,000 people, about half of the Irgun's membership, including the senior command staff, regional committee members, along with most of the Irgun's weapons, returned to the Haganah, which at that time was under the Jewish Agency's leadership. The Supervisory Committee's control over the Irgun ended, and Jabotinsky assumed command. In their opinion, the removal of the Haganah from the Jewish Agency's leadership to the national institutions necessitated their return. Furthermore, they no longer saw significant ideological differences between the movements. Those who remained in the Irgun were primarily young activists, mostly laypeople, who sided with the independent existence of the Irgun. In fact, most of those who remained were originally Betar people. [[Moshe Rosenberg]] estimated that approximately 1,800 members remained. In theory, the Irgun remained an organization not aligned with a political party, but in reality the supervisory committee was disbanded and the Irgun's continued ideological path was outlined according to Ze'ev Jabotinsky's school of thought and his decisions, until the movement eventually became Revisionist Zionism's military arm. One of the major changes in policy by Jabotinsky was the end of the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].\n\nOn April 27, 1937 the Irgun founded a new headquarters, staffed by Moshe Rosenberg at the head, [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] as secretary, [[David Raziel]] as head of the Jerusalem branch, [[Hanoch Kalai]] as commander of Haifa and [[Aharon Haichman]] as commander of Tel Aviv. On 20 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], (June 29) the day of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s death, a ceremony was held in honor of the reorganization of the underground movement. For security purposes this ceremony was held at a construction site in Tel Aviv.\n\nZe'ev Jabotinsky placed Col. [[Robert Bitker]] at the head of the Irgun. Bitker had previously served as Betar commissioner in China and had military experience. A few months later, probably due to total incompatibility with the position, Jabotinsky replaced Bitker with Moshe Rosenberg. When the [[Peel Commission]] report was published a few months later, the Revisionist camp decided not to accept the commission's recommendations. Moreover, the organizations of Betar, [[Hatzohar]] and the Irgun began to increase their efforts to bring Jews to the land of Israel, illegally. This [[Aliyah]] was known as the \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9 \"Af Al Pi (Nevertheless) Aliyah\". As opposed to this position, the Jewish Agency began acting on behalf of the Zionist interest on the political front, and continued the policy of restraint. From this point onwards the differences between the Haganah and the Irgun were much more obvious.\n\n===Illegal immigration===\n[[File:Parita22839.jpg|thumb|The ship [[:he:\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4|''Parita'']] unloading immigrants at the beach in [[Tel Aviv]]]]\nAccording to Jabotinsky's \"Evacuation Plan\", which called for millions of [[European Jews]] to be brought to Palestine at once, the Irgun helped the [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] of European Jews to the land of Israel. This was named by Jabotinsky the \"National Sport\". The most significant part of this immigration prior to [[World War II]] was carried out by the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] camp, largely because the [[Yishuv]] institutions and the Jewish Agency shied away from such actions on grounds of cost and their belief that Britain would in the future allow widespread Jewish immigration.\n\nThe Irgun joined forces with [[Hatzohar]] and [[Betar]] in September 1937, when it assisted with the landing of a convoy of 54 Betar members at Tantura Beach (near [[Haifa]].) The Irgun was responsible for discreetly bringing the [[Olim]], or Jewish immigrants, to the beaches, and dispersing them among the various Jewish settlements. The Irgun also began participating in the organisation of the immigration enterprise and undertook the process of accompanying the ships. This began with the ship ''Draga'' which arrived at the coast of British Palestine in September 1938. In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Betar representative and [[Hillel Kook]], the Irgun representative, to coordinate the immigration (also known as [[Ha'apala]]). This agreement was also made in the \"Paris Convention\" in February 1939, at which Ze'ev Jabotinsky and David Raziel were present. Afterwards, the \"Aliyah Center\" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Betar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the process.\n\nThe difficult conditions on the ships demanded a high level of discipline. The people on board the ships were often split into units, led by commanders. In addition to having a daily roll call and the distribution of food and water (usually very little of either), organized talks were held to provide information regarding the actual arrival in Palestine. One of the largest ships was the ''Sakaria'', with 2,300 passengers, which equalled about 0.5% of the Jewish population in Palestine. The first vessel arrived on April 13, 1937, and the last on February 13, 1940. All told, about 18,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine with the help of the Revisionist organizations and private initiatives by other Revisionists. Most were not caught by the British.\n\n===End of restraint===\n{{Main|List of Irgun attacks}}\n[[File:David raziel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Raziel]], commander of the Irgun]]\nIrgun members continued to defend settlements, but at the same time began attacks on Arab villages, thus ending the policy of restraint. These attacks were intended to instill fear in the Arab side, in order to cause the Arabs to wish for peace and quiet. In March 1938, [[David Raziel]] wrote in the underground newspaper \"By the Sword\" a constitutive article for the Irgun overall, in which he coined the term '''\"Active Defense\"''':\n:The actions of the Haganah alone will never be a true victory. If the goal of the war is to break the will of the enemy \u2013 and this cannot be attained without destroying his spirit \u2013 clearly we cannot be satisfied with solely defensive operations.... Such a method of defense, that allows the enemy to attack at will, to reorganize and attack again ... and does not intend to remove the enemy's ability to attack a second time \u2013 is called passive defense, and ends in downfall and destruction ... whoever does not wish to be beaten has no choice but to attack. The fighting side, that does not intend to oppress but to save its liberty and honor, he too has only one way available \u2013 the way of attack. Defensiveness by way of offensiveness, in order to deprive the enemy the option of attacking, is called ''active defense''.\n\nThe first attacks began around April 1936, and by the end of World War II, more than 250 Arabs had been killed. Examples include:\n*After an Arab shooting at Carmel school in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the death of a Jewish child, Irgun members attacked an Arab neighborhood near [[Kerem Hatemanim]] in Tel Aviv, killing one Arab man and injuring another.\n*On August 17, the Irgun responded to shootings by Arabs from the [[Jaffa]]\u2013[[Jerusalem]] train towards Jews that were waiting by the train block on Herzl Street in Tel Aviv. The same day, when a Jewish child was injured by the shooting, Irgun members attacked a train on the same route, killing one Arab and injuring five.\nDuring 1936, Irgun members carried out approximately ten attacks.\n\nThroughout 1937 the Irgun continued this line of operation.\n*On March 6, a Jew at Sabbath prayers at the [[Western Wall]] was shot by a local Arab. A few hours later, the Irgun shot at an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rechavia.\n*On June 29, a band of Arabs attacked an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus on the Jerusalem \u2013 Tel Aviv road, killing one Jew. The following day, two Jews were also killed near [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Karkur]]. A few hours later, the Irgun carried out a number of operations.\n**An Arab bus making its way from [[Lifta]] was attacked in Jerusalem.\n**In two other locations in Jerusalem, Arabs were shot as well.\n**In Tel Aviv, a hand grenade was thrown at an Arab coffee shop on Carmel St., injuring many of the patrons.\n**Irgun members also injured an Arab on Reines St. in Tel Aviv.\n**On September 5, the Irgun responded to the murder of a rabbi on his way home from prayer in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] by throwing explosives at an Arab bus that had left Lifta, injuring two female passengers and a British police officer.\n\nA more complete list can be found [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|here]].\n\nAt that time, however, these acts were not yet a part of a formulated policy of the Irgun.<ref>\"Tagar u'Magen (Jabotinsky and the Etzel)\" {{in lang|he}}, Jabtotinsky Publishing, pp. 28</ref> Not all of the aforementioned operations received a commander's approval, and Jabotinsky was not in favor of such actions at the time. Jabotinsky still hoped to establish a Jewish force out in the open that would not have to operate underground. However, the failure, in its eyes, of the [[Peel Commission]] and the renewal of violence on the part of the Arabs caused the Irgun to rethink its official policy.\n\n===Increase in operations===\n14 November 1937 was a watershed in Irgun activity. From that date, the Irgun increased its reprisals. Following an increase in the number of attacks aimed at Jews, including the killing of five [[kibbutz]] members near [[Kiryat Anavim]] (today kibbutz [[Ma'ale HaHamisha]]), the Irgun undertook a series of attacks in various places in Jerusalem, killing five Arabs. Operations were also undertaken in [[Haifa]] (shooting at the Arab-populated [[Wadi Nisnas]] neighborhood) and in [[Herzliya]]. The date is known as the day the policy of restraint ([[Havlagah]]) ended, or as [[Black Sunday, 1937|Black Sunday]] when operations resulted in the murder of 10 Arabs. This is when the organization fully changed its policy, with the approval of Jabotinsky and Headquarters to the policy of \"active defense\" in respect of Irgun actions.<ref>\"The Birth of an Underground Organization\", Yehuda Lapidot, pp. 62 {{in lang|he}}</ref>\n\nThe British responded with the arrest of Betar and Hatzohar members as suspected members of the Irgun. [[Military court]]s were allowed to act under \"Time of Emergency Regulations\" and even sentence people to death. In this manner [[Yehezkel Altman]], a guard in a Betar battalion in the [[Nahalat Yizchak]] neighborhood of Tel Aviv, shot at an Arab bus, without his commanders' knowledge. Altman was acting in response to a shooting at Jewish vehicles on the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem road the day before. He turned himself in later and was sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to a life sentence.\n\nDespite the arrests, Irgun members continued fighting. Jabotinsky lent his moral support to these activities. In a letter to Moshe Rosenberg on 18 March 1938 he wrote:\n:Tell them: from afar I collect and save, as precious treasures, news items about your lives. I know of the obstacles that have not impeded your spirit; and I know of your actions as well. I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with such students.\n\nAlthough the Irgun continued activities such as these, following Rosenberg's orders, they were greatly curtailed. Furthermore, in fear of the British threat of the death sentence for anyone found carrying a weapon, all operations were suspended for eight months. However, opposition to this policy gradually increased. In April, 1938, responding to the killing of six Jews, Betar members from the [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]] Brigade went on a reprisal mission, without the consent of their commander, as described by historian [[Avi Shlaim]]:\n:On 21 April 1938, after several weeks of planning, he and two of his colleagues from the Irgun (Etzel) ambushed an Arab bus at a bend on a mountain road near Safad. They had a hand grenade, a gun and a pistol. Their plan was to destroy the engine so that the bus would fall off the side of the road and all the passengers would be killed. When the bus approached, they fired at it (not in the air, as Mailer has it) but the grenade lobbed by Ben Yosef did not detonate. The bus with its screaming and terrified passengers drove on.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| title = Bombers not Martyrs\n| author = Avi Shlaim\n| date=  January 6, 2005\n| magazine = London Review of Books\n| url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n01/letters.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the incident ended without casualties, the three were caught, and one of them \u2013 [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] was sentenced to death. Demonstrations around the country, as well as pressure from institutions and people such as [[Haim Weizman|Dr. Chaim Weizmann]] and the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] did not reduce his sentence. In Shlomo Ben-Yosef's writings in Hebrew were later found:\n:I am going to die and I am not sorry at all. Why? Because I am going to die for our country. Shlomo Ben-Yosef.\n\nOn 29 June 1938 he was executed, and was the first of the [[Olei Hagardom]]. The Irgun revered him after his death and many regarded him as an example.\nIn light of this, and due to the anger of the Irgun leadership over the decision to adopt a policy of restraint until that point, Jabotinsky relieved Rosenberg of his post and replaced him with David Raziel, who proved to be the most prominent Irgun commander until [[Menachem Begin]]. Jabotinsky simultaneously instructed the Irgun to end its policy of restraint, leading to armed offensive operations until the end of the Arab Revolt in 1939. In this time, the Irgun mounted about 40 operations against Arabs and Arab villages, for instance:\n*After a Jewish father and son were killed in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], on June 6, 1938, Irgun members threw explosives from the roof of a nearby house, killing two Arabs and injuring four.\n*The Irgun planted [[land mine]]s in a number of Arab [[Souk|markets]], primarily in places identified by the Irgun as activity centers of armed Arab gangs.\n*Explosives detonated in the Arab [[souk]] in Jerusalem on July 15, killed ten local Arabs.\n*In similar circumstances, 70 Arabs were killed by a [[land mine]] planted in the Arab souk in Haifa.\n\nThis action led the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to discuss the disturbances in Palestine. On 23 February 1939 the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Malcolm MacDonald]] revealed the British intention to cancel the mandate and establish a state that would preserve Arab rights. This caused a wave of riots and attacks by Arabs against Jews. The Irgun responded four days later with a series of attacks on Arab buses and other sites. The British used military force against the Arab rioters and in the latter stages of the revolt by the Arab community in Palestine, it deteriorated into a series of internal gang wars.\n\n====During the same period====\n[[File:Irgun poster Erez Jisrael.jpg|thumb|1931 [[propaganda]] poster of the Irgun for distribution in [[central Europe]] \u2013 the map shows Israel defined in the borders of both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which the Irgun claimed in its entirety for a future Jewish state.]]\n\nAt the same time, the Irgun also established itself in Europe. The Irgun built underground cells that participated in organizing migration to Palestine. The cells were made up almost entirely of Betar members, and their primary activity was military training in preparation for emigration to Palestine. Ties formed with the Polish authorities brought about courses in which Irgun commanders were trained by Polish officers in advanced military issues such as [[guerrilla warfare]], [[Tactic (method)|tactics]] and laying land mines. [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] was notable among the cell organizers in Europe. In 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the underground. According to Irgun activists Poland supplied the organization with 25,000 rifles, and additional material and weapons, by summer 1939 the Warsaw warehouses of Irgun held 5,000 rifles and 1,000 machine guns. The training and support by Poland would allow the organization to mobilize 30,000-40,000 men<ref>Perspectives on the Holocaust pp 71-91 The Irgun and the Destruction of European Jewry Yitshaq Ben-Ami page 75-76</ref> The transfer of handguns, rifles, explosives and ammunition stopped with the outbreak of World War II. Another field in which the Irgun operated was the training of pilots, so they could serve in the [[Air Force]] in the future war for independence, in the flight school in [[Lod]].\n\nTowards the end of 1938 there was progress towards aligning the ideologies of the Irgun and the Haganah. Many abandoned the belief that the land would be divided and a Jewish state would soon exist. The Haganah founded \u05e4\u05d5\"\u05de, a special operations unit, (pronounced ''poom''), which carried out reprisal attacks following Arab violence. These operations continued into 1939. Furthermore, the opposition within the [[Yishuv]] to illegal immigration significantly decreased, and the Haganah began to bring Jews to Palestine using rented ships, as the Irgun had in the past.\n\n===First operations against the British===\nThe publishing of the MacDonald [[White Paper of 1939]] brought with it new edicts that were intended to lead to a more equitable settlement between Jews and Arabs. However, it was considered by some Jews to have an adverse effect on the continued development of the Jewish community in Palestine. Chief among these was the prohibition on selling land to Jews, and the smaller quotas for Jewish immigration. The entire Yishuv was furious at the contents of the White Paper. There were demonstrations against the \"Treacherous Paper\", as it was considered that it would preclude the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\nUnder the temporary command of [[Hanoch Kalai]], the Irgun began sabotaging strategic infrastructure such as electricity facilities, radio and telephone lines. It also started publicizing its activity and its goals. This was done in street announcements, newspapers, as well as the underground radio station [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]]. On August 26, 1939, the Irgun killed [[Ralph Cairns]], a British police officer who, as head of the Jewish Department in the [[Palestine Police]], had [[torture]]d a number of youths who were underground members.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bell | first = John Bowyer | title = Terror Out of Zion | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year = 1996 | page = 48 | isbn = 9781560008705}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Ben-Yehuda | first = Nahman | title = Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1993 | page = 155 | isbn = 0791411664}}</ref> Cairns and Ronald Barker, another British police officer, were killed by an Irgun [[improvised explosive device|IED]].<ref>\"Mine Explosion In Jerusalem.\" OUR CORRESPONDENT, The Times [London, England] 28 Aug. 1939: 12.

On the next day, September 1, 1939, World War II broke out.\n\n==During World War II==\nFollowing the outbreak of war, Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the [[New Zionist Organization]] voiced their support for Britain and France. In mid-September 1939 Raziel was moved from his place of detention in [[Tzrifin]]. This, among other events, encouraged the Irgun to announce a cessation of its activities against the British so as not to hinder Britain's effort to fight \"the Hebrew's greatest enemy in the world \u2013 German [[Nazism]]\". This announcement ended with the hope that after the war a Hebrew state would be founded \"within the historical borders of the liberated homeland\". After this announcement Irgun, Betar and Hatzohar members, including Raziel and the Irgun leadership, were gradually released from detention. The Irgun did not rule out joining the British army and the [[Jewish Brigade]]. Irgun members did enlist in various British units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgun.html |title=Irgun Zeva'i Le'umi\u2014\"The National Military Organization\" (Etzel, I.Z.L.) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Irgun members also assisted British forces with intelligence in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. An Irgun unit also operated in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. David Raziel later died during one of these operations.\n\nDuring the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Betar members revolted numerous times against the Nazis in [[occupied Europe]]. The largest of these revolts was the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], in which an armed underground organization fought, formed by Betar and Hatzoar and known as the ''[[Jewish Military Union (League)|\u017bydowski Zwi\u0105zek Wojskowy]] (\u017bZW)'' (Jewish Military Union). Despite its political origins, the \u017bZW accepted members without regard to political affiliation, and had contacts established before the war with elements of the Polish military. Because of differences over objectives and strategy, the \u017bZW was unable to form a common front with the mainstream ghetto fighters of the [[Jewish Combat Organization|\u017bydowska Organizacja Bojowa]], and fought independently under the military leadership of [[Pawe\u0142 Frenkiel]] and the political leadership of [[Dawid Wdowi\u0144ski]].<ref>See Chaim Lazar, ''Matsada shel Varsha'' (Tel Aviv: Machon Jabotinsky, 1963), David Wdowi\u0144ski, (1963), ''And we are not saved.''

In July 1943 the \"Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People in Europe\" was formed, and worked until the end of the war to rescue the [[Jews of Europe]] from the Nazis and to garner public support for a Jewish state. However, it was not until January 1944 that [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] established the [[War Refugee Board]], which achieved some success in saving European Jews.\n\n===Second split===\n[[File:Avraham Stern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]]]]\nThroughout this entire period, the British continued enforcing the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]]'s provisions, which included a ban on the sale of land, restrictions on Jewish immigration and increased vigilance against illegal immigration. Part of the reason why the British banned land sales (to anyone) was the confused state of the post Ottoman land registry; it was difficult to determine who actually owned the land that was for sale.\n\nWithin the ranks of the Irgun this created much disappointment and unrest, at the center of which was disagreement with the leadership of the [[New Zionist Organization]], David Raziel and the Irgun Headquarters. On June 18, 1939, Avraham (Yair) Stern and others of the leadership were released from prison and a rift opened between them the Irgun and Hatzohar leadership. The controversy centred on the issues of the underground movement submitting to public political leadership and fighting the British. On his release from prison Raziel resigned from Headquarters. To his chagrin, independent operations of senior members of the Irgun were carried out and some commanders even doubted Raziel's loyalty.\n\nIn his place, Stern was elected to the leadership. In the past, Stern had founded secret Irgun cells in Poland without Jabotinsky's knowledge, in opposition to his wishes. Furthermore, Stern was in favor of removing the Irgun from the authority of the New Zionist Organization, whose leadership urged Raziel to return to the command of the Irgun. He finally consented. Jabotinsky wrote to Raziel and to Stern, and these letters were distributed to the branches of the Irgun:\n\n:... I call upon you: Let nothing disturb our unity. Listen to the commissioner (Raziel), whom I trust, and promise me that you and [[Betar]], the greatest of my life's achievements, will stand strong and united and allow me to continue with the hope for victory in the war to realize our old [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] dream....\n\nStern was sent a telegram with an order to obey Raziel, who was reappointed. However, these events did not prevent the splitting of the organization. Suspicion and distrust were rampant among the members. Out of the Irgun a new organization was created on July 17, 1940,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac05.htm |title=The Split Within The Irgun |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> which was first named \"The National Military Organization in Israel\" (as opposed to the \"National Military Organization in '''the Land of''' Israel\") and later on changed its name to [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], an acronym for '''Lohamei Herut Israel''', \"Fighters for the Freedom of Israel\", (\u05dc\u05d7\"\u05d9 \u2013 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc). Jabotinsky died in [[New York (state)|New York]] on August 4, 1940, yet this did not prevent the Lehi split. Following Jabotinsky's death, ties were formed between the Irgun and the [[New Zionist Organization]]. These ties would last until 1944, when the Irgun declared a revolt against the British.\n\nThe primary difference between the Irgun and the newly formed organization was its intention to fight the British in Palestine, regardless of their war against Germany. Later, additional operational and ideological differences developed that contradicted some of the Irgun's guiding principles. For example, the Lehi, unlike the Irgun, supported a [[population exchange]] with local Arabs.\n\n===Change of policy===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float: right; border: 1px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 6px; font-size: 95%; margin: 8px 25px 8px 2px;\"\n| style=\"background: #ccf; text-align: center;\" | The Irgun's Anthem<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betar.org.il/en/content/view/9/6/ |title=World Zionist youth movement - Shir |publisher=Betar |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n|-\n|\nTagar -<br>\nThrough all obstacles and enemies<br>\nWhether you go up or down<br>\nIn the flames of revolt<br>\nCarry a flame to kindle \u2013 never mind!<br>\nFor silence is filth<br>\nWorthless is blood and soul<br>\nFor the sake of the hidden glory\n\nTo die or to conquer the hill -<br>\nYodefet, Masada, Betar.\n|}\nThe split damaged the Irgun both organizationally and from a morale point of view. As their spiritual leader, Jabotinsky's death also added to this feeling. Together, these factors brought about a mass abandonment by members. The British took advantage of this weakness to gather intelligence and arrest Irgun activists. The new Irgun leadership, which included Meridor, Yerachmiel Ha'Levi, [[Moshe Zvi Segal (Rabbi)|Rabbi Moshe Zvi Segal]] and others used the forced hiatus in activity to rebuild the injured organization. This period was also marked by more cooperation between the Irgun and the Jewish Agency, however [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s uncompromising demand that Irgun accept the Agency's command foiled any further cooperation.\n\nIn both the Irgun and the Haganah more voices were being heard opposing any cooperation with the British. Nevertheless, an Irgun operation carried out in the service of Britain was aimed at sabotaging pro-Nazi forces in [[Iraq]], including the assassination of [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]]. Among others, Raziel and [[Yaakov Meridor]] participated. On April 20, 1941, during a [[Luftwaffe]] air raid on [[Habbaniya Airport|RAF Hannaniya]] near [[Baghdad]], David Raziel, commander of the Irgun, was killed during the operation.\n\nIn late 1943 a joint Haganah \u2013 Irgun initiative was developed, to form a single fighting body, unaligned with any political party, by the name of \u05e2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd (''Fighting Nation'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmach.org.il/|title=\u05d3\u05e3 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea|website=www.palmach.org.il|access-date=2007-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830212132/http://www.palmach.org.il/|archive-date=2012-08-30|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/1146 |title=Reflections on the assassination of Sheikh Yassin |publisher=Fromoccupiedpalestine.org}}</ref> The new body's first plan was to kidnap the British High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]] and take him to [[Cyprus]]. However, the Haganah leaked the planned operation and it was thwarted before it got off the ground. Nevertheless, at this stage the Irgun ceased its cooperation with the British. As [[Eliyahu Lankin]] tells in his book:\n:Immediately following the failure of ''Fighting Nation'' practical discussions began in the Irgun Headquarters regarding a declaration of war.\n\n==The Revolt==\nIn 1943 the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]], commanded by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders]], arrived in Palestine from [[Iraq]]. The British insisted that no Jewish units of the army be created. Eventually, many of the soldiers of Jewish origin that arrived with the army were released and allowed to stay in Palestine. One of them was [[Menachem Begin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sullivan/bios/MenachemBegin-Bio.html|title=Menachem Begin Biography|website=www.ibiblio.org}}</ref> whose arrival in Palestine created new-found expectations within the Irgun and Betar. Begin had served as head of the Betar movement in [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/begin-bio.html |title=Menachem Begin \u2013 Biography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> and was a respected leader. [[Yaakov Meridor]], then the commander of the Irgun, raised the idea of appointing Begin to the post. In late 1943, when Begin accepted the position, a new leadership was formed. Meridor became Begin's deputy, and other members of the board were Aryeh Ben Eliezer, Eliyahu Lankin, and Shlomo Lev Ami.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgunrevolt.html|title=The Revolt is Proclaimed by the Irgun|last=Lapidot|first=Yehuda|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 1944 the Irgun put up posters all around the country, proclaiming a revolt against the British mandatory government. The posters began by saying that all of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movements stood by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] and over 25,000 Jews had enlisted in the British military. The hope to establish a Jewish army had died. European Jewry was trapped and was being destroyed, yet Britain, for its part, did not allow any rescue missions. This part of the document ends with the following words:\n:[[MacDonald White Paper|The White Paper]] is still in effect. It is enforced, despite the betrayal of the Arabs and the loyalty of the Jews; despite the mass enlisting to the British Army; despite the [[ceasefire]] and the quiet in The Land of Israel; despite the massacre of masses of the Jewish people in Europe....\n\n:The facts are simple and horrible as one. Over the last four years of [[World War II|the war]] we have lost millions of the best of our people; millions more are in danger of eradication. And The Land of Israel is closed off and quarantined because the British rule it, realizing the White Paper, and strives for the destruction of our people's last hope.\n\nThe Irgun then declared that, for its part, the ceasefire was over and they were now at war with the British. It demanded the transfer of rule to a Jewish government, to implement ten policies. Among these were the mass evacuation of Jews from Europe, the signing of treaties with any state that recognized the Jewish state's sovereignty, including Britain, granting social justice to the state's residents, and full equality to the Arab population. The proclamation ended with:\n:The God of Israel, God of Hosts, will be at our side. There is no retreat. Liberty or death.... The fighting youth will not recoil in the face of sacrifices and suffering, blood and torment. They will not surrender, so long as our days of old are not renewed, so long as our nation is not ensured a homeland, liberty, honor, bread, justice and law.\n\nThe Irgun began this campaign rather weakly. At the time of the start of the revolt, it was only about 1,000 strong, including some 200 fighters. It possessed about 4 submachine guns, 40 rifles, 60 pistols, 150 hand grenades, and 2,000 kilograms of explosive material, and its funds were about \u00a3800.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\n===Struggle against the British===\n{{Main|Jewish insurgency in Palestine}}\nThe Irgun began a militant operation against the symbols of government, in an attempt to harm the regime's operation as well as its reputation. The first attack was on February 12, 1944 at the government immigration offices, a symbol of the immigration laws. The attacks went smoothly and ended with no casualties\u2014as they took place on a Saturday night, when the buildings were empty\u2014in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. On February 27 the income tax offices were bombed. Parts of the same cities were blown up, also on a Saturday night; prior warnings were put up near the buildings. On March 23 the national headquarters building of the British police in the [[Migrash Harusim|Russian Compound]] in Jerusalem was attacked, and part of it was blown up. These attacks in the first few months were sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv and by the Jewish Agency, who saw them as dangerous provocations.\n\nAt the same time the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] also renewed its attacks against the British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+Eight+The+Struggle+for+the+Establishment+of+the+State+of+Israel.htm |title=Chapter Eight: The Struggle for the Establishment of the State of Israel |publisher=Jewishagency.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> The Irgun continued to attack police stations and headquarters, and [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]], a fortified police station (today the location of [[Latrun]]). One relatively complex operation was the takeover of the radio station in [[Ramallah]], on May 17, 1944.\n\nOne symbolic act by the Irgun happened before [[Yom Kippur]] of 1944. They plastered notices around town, warning that no British officers should come to the [[Western Wall]] on Yom Kippur, and for the first time since the mandate began no British police officers were there to prevent the Jews from the traditional [[Shofar]] blowing at the end of the fast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/hayom/2a-2.htm|title=\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05e8\u05d3|website=www.daat.ac.il}}</ref> After the fast that year the Irgun attacked four police stations in Arab settlements. In order to obtain weapons, the Irgun carried out \"confiscation\" operations \u2013 they robbed British armouries and smuggled stolen weapons to their own hiding places. During this phase of activity the Irgun also cut all of its official ties with the [[New Zionist Organization]], so as not to tie their fate in the underground organization.\n\nBegin wrote in his [[memoir]]s, ''[[The Revolt]]'':\n:History and experience taught us that if we are able to destroy the prestige of the British in Palestine, the regime will break. Since we found the enslaving government's weak point, we did not let go of it.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The Revolt\n| url = https://archive.org/details/revolt00mena\n| url-access = registration\n| author = Menachem Begin\n| year=  1977}}</ref>\n\n===Underground exiles===\n{{Main|Irgun and Lehi internment in Africa}}\nIn October 1944 the British began expelling hundreds of arrested Irgun and Lehi members to detention camps in [[Africa]]. 251 detainees from [[Latrun]] were flown on thirteen planes, on October 19 to a camp in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. Eleven additional transports were made. Throughout the period of their detention, the detainees often initiated rebellions and hunger strikes. Many escape attempts were made until July 1948 when the exiles were returned to Israel. While there were numerous successful escapes from the camp itself, only nine men actually made it back all the way. One noted success was that of [[Yaakov Meridor]], who escaped nine times before finally reaching Europe in April 1948. These tribulations were the subject of his book ''Long is the Path to Freedom: Chronicles of one of the Exiles''.\n\n===Hunting Season===\n{{Main|The Hunting Season}}\nOn November 6, 1944, [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], British Deputy Resident Minister of State in [[Cairo]] was assassinated by Lehi members [[Eliyahu Hakim]] and [[Eliyahu Bet-Zuri]]. This act raised concerns within the Yishuv from the British regime's reaction to the underground's violent acts against them. Therefore, the Jewish Agency decided on starting a ''Hunting Season'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac07.htm |title=The 'Hunting Season' |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/history/lapidot/8.htm |title=Besiege / Yehuda Lapidut \u2013 The Hunting Season |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> known as the ''saison'', (from the [[French language|French]] \"la saison de chasse\").\n\nThe Irgun's recuperation was noticeable when it began to renew its cooperation with the Lehi in May 1945, when it sabotaged oil pipelines, telephone lines and railroad bridges. All in all, over 1,000 members of the Irgun and Lehi were arrested and interned in British camps during the ''Saison''. Eventually the Hunting Season died out, and there was even talk of cooperation with the Haganah leading to the formation of the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]].\n\n===The Jewish Resistance Movement===\n{{Main|The Jewish Resistance Movement}}\n[[File:KD 1946.JPG|thumb|The King David Hotel after the bombing, photo from [[The Jerusalem Post|''The Palestine Post'']]]]\n\nTowards the end of July 1945 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] in Britain was elected to power. The Yishuv leadership had high hopes that this would change the anti-Zionist policy that the British maintained at the time. However, these hopes were quickly dashed when the government limited Jewish immigration, with the intention that the population of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) would not be more than one third of the total. This, along with the stepping up of arrests and their pursuit of underground members and illegal immigration organizers led to the formation of the [[The Jewish Resistance Movement|Jewish Resistance Movement]]. This body consolidated the armed resistance to the British of the Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah. For ten months the Irgun and the Lehi cooperated and they carried out nineteen attacks and defense operations. The Haganah and Palmach carried out ten such operations. The Haganah also assisted in landing 13,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nTension between the underground movements and the British increased with the increase in operations. On April 23, 1946, an operation undertaken by the Irgun to gain weapons from the [[Tegart fort]] at [[Ramat Gan]] resulted in a firefight with the police in which an Arab constable and two Irgun fighters were killed, including one who jumped on an explosive device to save his comrades. A third fighter, [[Dov Gruner]], was wounded and captured. He stood trial and was sentenced to be death by hanging, refusing to sign a pardon request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac14.htm |title=The Gallows |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, British relations with the Yishuv worsened, building up to [[Operation Agatha]] of June 29. The authorities ignored the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]'s recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews into Palestine at once. As a result of the discovery of documents tying the Jewish Agency to the Jewish Resistance Movement, the Irgun was asked to speed up the plans for the [[King David Hotel bombing]] of July 22.<ref>Jabotinsky Institute Archives (k-4 1/11/5)</ref> The hotel was where the documents were located, the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|Criminal Investigation Division]] of the police. The Irgun later claimed to have sent a warning that was ignored.<ref>Menachem Begin, ''The Revolt''. 1951, p. 221</ref> Palestinian and U.S. sources confirm that the Irgun issued numerous warnings for civilians to evacuate the hotel prior to the bombing.<ref name=\"Abrahms\"/> 91 people were killed in the attack where a 350&nbsp;kg bomb was placed in the basement of the hotel and caused a large section of it to collapse. Only 13 were British soldiers.\n\n===Further struggle against the British===\n[[File:Menahem Begin during his \"Rabbi Sassover\" period with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] as \"Rabbi Sassover\", with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev, Tel Aviv, December 1946]]\n\nThe King David Hotel bombing and the arrest of Jewish Agency and other Yishuv leaders as part of [[Operation Agatha]] caused the Haganah to cease their armed activity against the British. Yishuv and Jewish Agency leaders were released from prison. From then until the end of the British mandate, resistance activities were led by the Irgun and Lehi. In early September 1946 the Irgun renewed its attacks against civil structures, railroads, communication lines and bridges. One operation was the attack on the train station in Jerusalem, in which [[Meir Feinstein]] was arrested and later committed suicide awaiting execution. According to the Irgun these sort of armed attacks were legitimate, since the trains primarily served the British, for redeployment of their forces. The Irgun also publicized leaflets, in three languages, not to use specific trains in danger of being attacked. For a while the British stopped train traffic at night. The Irgun also carried out repeated attacks against military and police traffic using disguised, electronically-detonated roadside mines which could be detonated by an operator hiding nearby as a vehicle passed, carried out arms raids against military bases and police stations (often disguised as British soldiers), launched bombing, shooting, and mortar attacks against military and police installations and checkpoints, and robbed banks to gain funds as a result of losing access to Haganah funding following the collapse of the Jewish Resistance Movement.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nOn October 31, 1946, in response to the British barring entry of Jews from Palestine, the Irgun [[1946 British Embassy bombing|blew up the British Embassy]] in [[Rome]], a center of British efforts to monitor and stop Jewish immigration. The Irgun also carried out a few other operations in Europe: a British troop train was derailed and an attempt against another troop train failed. An attack on a British officers club in [[Vienna]] took place in 1947, and an attack on another British officer's club in Vienna and a sergeant's club in [[Germany]] took place in 1948.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn December 1946 a sentence of 18 years and 18 beatings was handed down to a young Irgun member for robbing a bank. The Irgun made good on a threat they made<ref>{{cite news|title=FLOGGING SENTENCE|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2703695|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=25 December 1946|quote=He was convicted following a bank hold-up In September.  Irgun Zvai Leumi broadcast a threat that if the sentence were confirmed, British Army officers would be flogged in retaliation.}}</ref>  and after the detainee was whipped, Irgun members kidnapped British officers and beat them in public. The operation, known as the \"[[Night of the Beatings]]\" brought an end to British punitive beatings. The British, taking these acts seriously, moved many British families in Palestine into the confines of military bases, and some moved home.\n\n[[File:Bombe Irgoun 29 dec 1947.jpg|thumb|left|Arab bus after a bomb attack by the Irgun, 29 December 1947]]\nOn February 14, 1947, [[Ernest Bevin]] announced that the Jews and Arabs would not be able to agree on any British proposed solution for the land, and therefore the issue must be brought to the [[United Nations]] (UN) for a final decision. The Yishuv thought of the idea to transfer the issue to the UN as a British attempt to achieve delay while a UN inquiry commission would be established, and its ideas discussed, and all the while the Yishuv would weaken. [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet|Foundation for Immigration B]] increased the number of ships bringing in Jewish refugees. The British still strictly enforced the policy of limited Jewish immigration and illegal immigrants were placed in detention camps in [[Cyprus]], which increased the anger of the Jewish community towards the mandate government.\n\nThe Irgun stepped up its activity and from February 19 until March 3 it attacked 18 British military camps, convoy routes, vehicles, and other facilities. The most notable of these attacks was the bombing of a British officer's club located in Goldsmith House in Jerusalem, which was in a heavily guarded security zone. Covered by machine-gun fire, an Irgun assault team in a truck penetrated the security zone and lobbed explosives into the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac12.htm |title=The Raid On The Jerusalem Officers Club |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Thirteen people, including two officers, were killed.<ref name=Hoffman/> As a result, martial law was imposed over much of the country, enforced by approximately 20,000 British soldiers. Despite this, attacks continued throughout the martial law period. The most notable one was an Irgun attack against the Royal Army Pay Corps base at the [[Schneller Orphanage]], in which a British soldier was killed.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nThroughout its struggle against the British, the Irgun sought to publicize its cause around the world. By humiliating the British, it attempted to focus global attention on Palestine, hoping that any British overreaction would be widely reported, and thus result in more political pressure against the British. Begin described this strategy as turning Palestine into a \"glass house\". The Irgun also re-established many representative offices internationally, and by 1948 operated in 23 states. In these countries the Irgun sometimes acted against the local British representatives or led public relations campaigns against Britain. According to [[Bruce Hoffman]]: \"''In an era long before the advent of 24/7 global news coverage and instantaneous satellite-transmitted broadcasts, the Irgun deliberately attempted to appeal to a worldwide audience far beyond the immediate confines of its local struggle, and beyond even the ruling regime's own homeland''.\"<ref name=Bell/><ref name=Hoffman/>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"7\" style=\"float: right; border: 4px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 95%; margin: 10px 30px 10px 4px;\"\n| style=\"background: #ccf; text-align: center;\" | [[Olei Hagardom|Executed Members of the Irgun]]\n|-\n|\n*[[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]]\n*[[Dov Gruner]]\n*[[Mordechai Alkahi]]\n*[[Yehiel Dresner]]\n*[[Eliezer Kashani]]\n*[[Yaakov Weiss]]\n*[[Avshalom Haviv]]\n*[[Meir Nakar]]\n|}\n\n===The Acre Prison break===\n{{Main|Acre Prison break}}\nOn April 16, 1947, Irgun members Dov Gruner, Yehiel Dresner, Eliezer Kashani, and Mordechai Alkahi were hanged in [[Acre Prison]], while singing [[Hatikvah]]. On April 21 [[Meir Feinstein]] and Lehi member [[Moshe Barazani]] blew themselves up, using a smuggled grenade, hours before their scheduled hanging. And on May 4 one of the Irgun's largest operations took place \u2013 the raid on Acre Prison. The operation was carried out by 23 men, commanded by Dov Cohen \u2013 AKA \"Shimshon\", along with the help of the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] prisoners inside the prison. The Irgun had informed them of the plan in advance and smuggled in explosives. After a hole was blasted in the prison wall, the 41 Irgun and Lehi members who had been chosen to escape then ran to the hole, blasting through inner prison gates with the smuggled explosives. Meanwhile, Irgun teams mined roads and launched a mortar attack on a nearby British Army camp to delay the arrival of responding British forces. Although the 41 escapees managed to get out of the prison and board the escape trucks, some were rapidly recaptured and nine of the escapees and attackers were killed. Five Irgun men in the attacking party were also captured. Overall, 27 of the 41 designated escapees managed to escape. Along with the underground movement members, other criminals \u2013 including 214 Arabs<ref>Horne, Edward (1982). A Job Well Done (Being a History of The Palestine Police Force 1920\u20131948).

British forces closed off and combed the area in search of the two, but did not find them. On July 29, 1947, in the afternoon, Meir Nakar, Avshalom Haviv, and Yaakov Weiss were executed. Approximately thirteen hours later the hostages were hanged in retaliation by the Irgun and their bodies, booby-trapped with an explosive, afterwards strung up from trees in woodlands south of Netanya. This action caused an outcry in Britain and was condemned both there and by Jewish leaders in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887512,00.html |title=Eye for an Eye for an Eye, Time Magazine.

The [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)]] was also influenced by this and other actions. At the same time another incident was developing \u2013 the events of the ship [[Exodus (ship)|''Exodus 1947'']]. The 4,500 Holocaust survivors on board were not allowed to enter Palestine. UNSCOP also covered the events. Some of its members were even present at [[Haifa]] port when the putative immigrants were forcefully removed from their ship (later found to have been rigged with an IED by some of its passengers) onto the deportation ships, and later commented that this strong image helped them press for an immediate solution for Jewish immigration and the question of Palestine.\n\nTwo weeks later, the House of Commons convened for a special debate on events in Palestine, and concluded that their soldiers should be withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\n==The 1948 Palestine War==\n{{Main|1948 Palestine War}}\n[[File:\u05d1\u05d2\u05d9\u05df (\u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6) \u05e2\u05dd \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] with Irgun members, 1948]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1102 Israel Defense Forces \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc \u05d1\u05e9\u05e2\u05ea \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7.jpg|thumb|Irgun fighters training in 1947]]\n[[File:Mitzad.jpg|thumb|Irgun parade in 1948]]\n\nUNSCOP's conclusion was a unanimous decision to end the British mandate, and a majority decision to divide [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) between a Jewish state and an Arab state. During the UN's deliberations regarding the committee's recommendations the Irgun avoided initiating any attacks, so as not to influence the UN negatively on the idea of a Jewish state. On November 29 the [[UN General Assembly]] voted in favor of ending the mandate and [[1947 UN Partition Plan|establishing two states]] on the land. That very same day the Irgun and the Lehi renewed their attacks on British targets. The next day the local Arabs began attacking the Jewish community, thus beginning the first stage of the [[1948 Palestine War]]. The first attacks on Jews were in Jewish neighborhoods of [[Jerusalem]], in and around [[Jaffa]], and in [[Bat Yam]], [[Holon]], and the [[Ha'Tikvah]] neighborhood in [[Tel Aviv]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1947, the Irgun had approximately 4,000 members. The goal of the organization at that point was the conquest of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea for the future Jewish state, and preventing Arab forces from driving out the Jewish community. The Irgun became almost an overt organization, establishing military bases in [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Petah Tikva]]. It began recruiting openly, thus significantly increasing in size. During the war the Irgun fought alongside the Lehi and the Haganah in the front against the Arab attacks. At first the Haganah maintained a defensive policy, as it had until then, but after the [[Convoy of 35]] incident it completely abandoned its policy of restraint: \"Distinguishing between individuals is no longer possible, for now \u2013 it is a war, and the even the innocent shall not be absolved.\"<ref>Netanel Lorch. ''The Edge of the Sword: Israel's War of Independence, 1947-1949'', Massada Publishing, 1958. pp. 85 {{in lang|he}}</ref>\n\nThe Irgun also began carrying out reprisal missions, as it had under David Raziel's command. At the same time though, it published announcements calling on the Arabs to lay down their weapons and maintain a ceasefire:\n:The National Military Organization has warned you, if the murderous attacks on Jewish civilians shall continue, its soldiers will penetrate your centers of activity and plague you. You have not heeded the warning. You continued to harm our brothers and murder them in wild cruelty. Therefore soldiers of the National Military Organization will go on the attack, as we have warned you.\n\n:... However even in these frenzied times, when Arab and Jewish blood is spilled at the British enslaver, we hereby call upon you ... to stop the attacks and create peace between us. We do not want a war with you. We are certain that neither do you want a war with us...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/begin/47_20-2.htm |title=Petition of Our Arab Neighbors: Announcement in Arabic to the Arab Rioters |language=Hebrew |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\nHowever the mutual attacks continued. The Irgun attacked the Arab villages of [[Al-Tira (Haifa)|Tira]] near [[Haifa]], [[Yehudiya]] ('Abassiya) in the center, and [[Shuafat]] by Jerusalem. The Irgun also attacked in the [[Wadi Rushmiya]] neighborhood in Haifa and [[Abu Kabir]] in Jaffa. On December 29 Irgun units arrived by boat to the Jaffa shore and a gunfight between them and Arab gangs ensued. The following day a bomb was thrown from a speeding Irgun car at a group of Arab men waiting to be hired for the day at the Haifa oil refinery, resulting in seven Arabs killed, and dozens injured. In response, some Arab workers [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre|attacked Jews in the area]], killing 41. This sparked a Haganah response in [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Sheykh]], which resulted in the deaths of 60 civilians. The Irgun's goal in the fighting was to move the battles from Jewish populated areas to Arab populated areas. On January 1, 1948 the Irgun attacked again in Jaffa, its men wearing British uniforms; later in the month it attacked in [[Beit Nabala]], a base for many Arab fighters. On 5 January 1948 the Irgun detonated a lorry bomb outside Jaffa's Ottoman built Town Hall, killing 14 and injuring 19.<ref>''[[The Scotsman]]'', 6 January 1948; Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed.

At the regional commander's request, on April 21 the Irgun took over an Arab post above Hadar Ha'Carmel as well as the Arab neighborhood of Wadi Nisnas, adjacent to the Lower City.\n\nThe Irgun acted independently in the conquest of Jaffa (part of the proposed Arab State according to the [[UN Partition Plan]]). On April 25 Irgun units, about 600 strong, left the Irgun base in [[Ramat Gan]] towards Arab Jaffa.

Heavy British shelling against Irgun positions in Jaffa failed to dislodge them, and when British armor pushed into the city, the Irgun resisted; a bazooka team managed to knock out one tank, buildings were blown up and collapsed onto the streets as the armor advanced, and Irgun men crawled up and tossed live dynamite sticks onto the tanks. The British withdrew, and opened negotiations with the Jewish authorities.<ref name=Bell/> An agreement was worked out, under which Operation Hametz would be stopped and the Haganah would not attack Jaffa until the end of the Mandate. The Irgun would evacuate Manshiya, with Haganah fighters replacing them. British troops would patrol its southern end and occupy the police fort. The Irgun had previously agreed with the Haganah that British pressure would not lead to withdrawal from Jaffa and that custody of captured areas would be turned over to the Haganah. The city ultimately fell on May 13 after Haganah forces entered the city and took control of the rest of the city, from the south \u2013 part of the ''Hametz Operation'' which included the conquest of a number of villages in the area. The battles in Jaffa were a great victory for the Irgun. This operation was the largest in the history of the organization, which took place in highly built up area that had many militants in shooting positions. During the battles explosives were used in order to break into homes and continue forging a way though them. Furthermore, this was the first occasion in which the Irgun had directly fought British forces, reinforced with armor and heavy weaponry. The city began these battles with an Arab population estimated at 70,000, which shrank to some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities. Since the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya on its own, causing the flight of many of Jaffa's residents, the Irgun took credit for the conquest of Jaffa. It had lost 42 dead and about 400 wounded during the battle.<ref name=Bell/>\n\n==Integration with the IDF and the Altalena Affair==\n{{Main|Altalena Affair}}\n\nOn May 14, 1948 [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|the establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] was proclaimed. The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), and the process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF started. On June 1, an agreement had been signed Between [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yisrael Galili]] for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF. One of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to stop smuggling arms. Meanwhile, in France, Irgun representatives purchased a ship, renamed ''[[Altalena]]'' (a pseudonym of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]), and weapons. The ship sailed on June 11 and arrived at the Israeli coast on June 20, during the first truce of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Despite [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 50]] declared an arms embargo in the region, neither side respected it.<ref>(Benny (2008), \"1948: The First Arab-Israeli War\", Yale University Press, New Haven, pp. 269\u201371, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12696-9}}).[[Mordechai Weingarten]]</ref>\n\nWhen the ship arrived the Israeli government, headed by Ben-Gurion, was adamant in its demand that the Irgun surrender and hand over all of the weapons. Ben-Gurion said: \"We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.\"\n\n[[File:Altalena off Tel-Aviv beach.jpg|thumb|left|''Altalena'' on fire after the Israeli government quelling of the Irgun's attempt to smuggle weapons]]\nThere were two confrontations between the newly formed IDF and the Irgun: when ''Altalena'' reached [[Kfar Vitkin]] in the late afternoon of Sunday, June 20 many Irgun militants, including Begin, waited on the shore. A clash with the [[Alexandroni Brigade]], commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), occurred. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties on both sides. The clash ended in a ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander, and with the ship, now reinforced with local Irgun members, including Begin, sailing to Tel Aviv, where the Irgun had more supporters.\nMany Irgun members, who joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and concentrated on the Tel Aviv beach. A confrontation between them and the IDF units started. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered [[Yigael Yadin]] (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the ''Altalena''. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn.\nSixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army; six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on [[Tel Aviv beach]]. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.\n\nAfter the shelling of the ''Altalena'', more than 200 Irgun fighters were arrested. Most of them were freed several weeks later. The Irgun militants were then fully integrated with the IDF and not kept in separate units.\n\nThe initial agreement for the integration of the Irgun into the IDF did not include [[Jerusalem]], where a small remnant of the Irgun called the ''Jerusalem Battalion'', numbering around 400 fighters, and Lehi, continued to operate independently of the government. Following the assassination of UN Envoy for Peace [[Folke Bernadotte]] by Lehi in September 1948, the Israeli government determined to immediately dismantle the underground organizations. An ultimatum was issued to the Irgun to liquidate as an independent organization and integrate into the IDF or be destroyed, and Israeli troops surrounded the Irgun camp in the Katamon Quarter of Jerusalem. The Irgun accepted the ultimatum on September 22, 1948, and shortly afterward the remaining Irgun fighters in Jerusalem began enlisting in the IDF and turning over their arms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19480923&id=13ssAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3395,2171340&hl=en|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref><ref>[https://www.jta.org/1948/09/22/archive/irgunists-in-jerusalem-surrender-their-arms-to-govt-dissidents-to-join-army-today Irgunists in Jerusalem Surrender Their Arms to Govt; Dissidents to Join Army Today] 22 September 1948, ''www.jta.org'', accessed 29 September 2019</ref> At Begin's orders, the Irgun in the diaspora formally disbanded on January 12, 1949, with the Irgun's former Paris headquarters becoming the European bureau of the [[Herut]] movement.\n\n== Propaganda ==\nIn order to increase the popularity of the Irgun organization and ideology, Irgun employed propaganda. This propaganda was mainly aimed at the British, and included the idea of [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]].

In addition, Begin ordered attacks to take place at night and even during [[Shabbat]] to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties. U.S. military intelligence found that \"the Irgun Zvai Leumi is waging a general war against the government and at all times took special care not to cause damage or injury to persons\". Although the King David Hotel bombing is widely considered a ''prima facie'' case of Irgun terrorism, Abrahms comments: \"But this hotel wasn't a normal hotel.

The Revisionist Movement made up a popular backing for the underground organization. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism, commanded the organization until he died in 1940. He formulated the general realm of operation, regarding ''[[Havlagah|Restraint]]'' and the end thereof, and was the inspiration for the organization overall. An additional major source of ideological inspiration was the poetry of [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]]. The symbol of the organization, with the motto \u05e8\u05e7 \u05db\u05da (only thus), underneath a hand holding a rifle in the foreground of a map showing both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] (at the time, both were administered under the terms of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]]), implied that force was the only way to \"liberate the homeland.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Mitchell|first= Thomas G.|title= Native vs. Settler: Ethnic Conflict in Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, and South Africa|year= 2000|publisher= Greenwood|page= 172|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&lpg=PA172&dq=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&pg=PA172#v=onepage&q=kach%20%22only%20thus%22%20irgun%20kahane&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe number of members of the Irgun varied from a few hundred to a few thousand. Most of its members were people who joined the organization's command,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} under which they carried out various operations and filled positions, largely in opposition to [[British law]]. Most of them were \"ordinary\" people, who held regular jobs, and only a few dozen worked full-time in the Irgun.\n\nThe Irgun disagreed with the policy of the [[Yishuv]] and with the [[World Zionist Organization]], both with regard to strategy and basic ideology and with regard to [[public relations|PR]] and military tactics, such as use of armed force to accomplish the Zionist ends, operations against the Arabs during the riots, and relations with the British mandatory government. Therefore, the Irgun tended to ignore the decisions made by the Zionist leadership and the Yishuv's institutions. This fact caused the elected bodies not to recognize the independent organization, and during most of the time of its existence the organization was seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as irresponsible, and its actions thus worthy of thwarting. Accordingly, the Irgun accompanied its armed operations with public-relations campaigns aiming to convince the public of the Irgun's way and the problems with the official political leadership of the Yishuv. The Irgun put out numerous advertisements, an underground newspaper and even ran the first independent Hebrew radio station \u2013 [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]].\n\n===Structure, command, and organization===\n{{Irgun Commanders}}\nAs members of an underground armed organization, Irgun personnel did not normally call Irgun by its name, but rather used other names. In the first years of its existence it was known primarily as ''Ha-Haganah Leumit''' (The National Defense), and also by names such as ''Haganah Bet'' (\"Second Defense\"), ''Irgun Bet'' (\"Second Irgun\"), the ''Parallel Organization'' and the ''Rightwing Organization''. Later on{{when|date=June 2016}} it became most widely known as \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05de\u05d3 (the Stand). The anthem adopted by the Irgun was \"Anonymous Soldiers\",<ref>http://www.betar.org.il/music/songs/hayalim.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://84.95.150.80/~betarco/|title=\u05d3\u05e3 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4\u05d2\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05ea}}</ref> written by [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] who was at the time a commander in the Irgun. Later on Stern defected from the Irgun and founded [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and the song became the anthem of the Lehi. The Irgun's new anthem then became the third verse of the \"[[Shir Betar|Betar Song]]\", by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.\n\nThe Irgun gradually evolved from its humble origins into a serious and well-organized paramilitary organization. The movement developed a hierarchy of ranks and a sophisticated command-structure, and came to demand serious military training and strict discipline from its members. It developed clandestine networks of hidden arms-caches and weapons-production workshops, safe-houses, and training camps, along with a secret printing facility for propaganda posters. \n\nThe ranks of the Irgun were (in ascending order):\n\n*''Khayal'' = (Private)\n*''Segen Rosh Kvutza'', ''Segen'' (\"Deputy Group Leader\", \"Deputy\") = Assistant Squad Leader ([[Lance Corporal]])\n*''Rosh Kvutza'' (\"Group Leader\") = Squad Leader ([[Corporal]])\n*''Samal'' (\"Sergeant\") = Section Leader ([[Staff Sergeant|Sergeant]])\n*''Samal Rishon'' (\"Sergeant First Class\") = Brigade Leader ([[Sergeant First Class|Platoon Sergeant]])\n*''Rav Samal'' (\"Chief Sergeant\") = Battalion Leader ([[Master Sergeant]])\n*''Gundar Sheni'', ''Gundar'' (\"Commander Second Class\", \"Commander\") = District Commander ([[2nd Lieutenant]])\n*''Gundar Rishon'' (\"Commander First Class\") = Senior Branch Commander, Headquarters Staff ([[Lieutenant]]).\n\nThe Irgun was led by a High Command, which set policy and gave orders. Directly underneath it was a General Staff, which oversaw the activities of the Irgun. The General Staff was divided into a military and a support staff. The military staff was divided into operational units that oversaw operations and support units in charge of planning, instruction, weapons caches and manufacture, and first aid. The military and support staff never met jointly; they communicated through the High Command. Beneath the General Staff were six district commands: [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]]-[[Galilee]], [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern]], [[Sharon plain|Sharon]], and [[Samaria|Shomron]], each led by a district commander.<ref name=Bell>Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976)</ref> A local Irgun district unit was called a \"Branch\". A \"brigade\" in the Irgun was made up of three sections. A section was made up of two groups, at the head of each was a \"Group Head\", and a deputy. Eventually, various units were established, which answered to a \"Center\" or \"Staff\".\n\nThe head of the Irgun High Command was the overall commander of the organization, but the designation of his rank varied. During the revolt against the British, Irgun commander [[Menachem Begin]] and the entire High Command held the rank of ''Gundar Rishon''. His predecessors, however, had held their own ranks. A rank of Military Commander ([[Israel Defense Forces ranks|Seren]]) was awarded to the Irgun commander [[Yaakov Meridor]] and a rank of High Commander ([[Aluf]]) to [[David Raziel]]. Until his death in 1940, Jabotinsky was known as the \"Military Commander of the Etzel\" or the ''Ha-Matzbi Ha-Elyon'' (\"Supreme Commander\").\n\nUnder the command of Menachem Begin, the Irgun was divided into different corps:\n\n* ''Hayil Kravi'' (Combat Corps) \u2013 responsible for combat operations\n* ''Delek'' (\"Gasoline\") \u2013 the intelligence section; responsible for gathering and translating intelligence, and maintaining contact with local and foreign journalists\n* ''HAT'' (Planning Division) \u2013 responsible for planning activities\n* ''HATAM'' (Revolutionary Publicity Corps) \u2013 responsible for printing and disseminating propaganda\n\nThe Irgun's commanders planned for it to have a regular combat force, a reserve, and shock units, but in practice there were not enough personnel for a reserve or for a shock force.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nThe Irgun emphasized that its fighters be highly disciplined. Strict drill exercises were carried out at ceremonies at different times, and strict attention was given to discipline, formal ceremonies and military relationships between the various ranks. The Irgun put out professional publications on combat doctrine, weaponry, leadership, drill exercises, etc. Among these publications were three books written by David Raziel, who had studied military history, techniques, and strategy:<ref>Schindler, Colin:''Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right'', p. 190</ref>\n\n* ''The Pistol'' (written in collaboration with Avraham Stern)\n* ''The Theory of Training''\n* ''Parade Ground and Field Drill''\n\nA British analysis noted that the Irgun's discipline was \"as strict as any army in the world.\"<ref name=Hoffman>Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Irgun operated a sophisticated recruitment and military-training regime. Those wishing to join had to find and make contact with a member, meaning only those who personally knew a member or were persistent could find their way in. Once contact had been established, a meeting was set up with the three-member selection committee at a safe-house, where the recruit was interviewed in a darkened room, with the committee either positioned behind a screen, or with a flashlight shone into the recruit's eyes. The interviewers asked basic biographical questions, and then asked a series of questions designed to weed out romantics and adventurers and those who had not seriously contemplated the potential sacrifices. Those selected attended a four-month series of indoctrination seminars in groups of five to ten, where they were taught the Irgun's ideology and the code of conduct it expected of its members. These seminars also had another purpose - to weed out the impatient and those of flawed purpose who had gotten past the selection interview. Then, members were introduced to other members, were taught the locations of safe-houses, and given military training. Irgun recruits trained with firearms, hand grenades, and were taught how to conduct combined attacks on targets. Arms handling and tactics courses were given in clandestine training camps, while practice shooting took place in the desert or by the sea. Eventually, separate training camps were established for heavy-weapons training. The most rigorous course was the explosives course for bomb-makers, which lasted a year.<ref name=Bell/> The British authorities believed that some Irgun members enlisted in the Jewish section of the [[Palestine Police Force]] for a year as part of their training, during which they also passed intelligence.<ref name=Hoffman/> In addition to the Irgun's sophisticated training program, many Irgun members were veterans of the Haganah (including the [[Palmach]]), the [[British Armed Forces]], and Jewish partisan groups that had waged guerrilla warfare in Nazi-occupied Europe, thus bringing significant military training and combat experience into the organization.<ref name=Hoffman/> The Irgun also operated a course for its intelligence operatives, in which recruits were taught espionage, cryptography, and analysis techniques.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nOf the Irgun's members, almost all were part-time members. They were expected to maintain their civilian lives and jobs, dividing their time between their civilian lives and underground activities. There were never more than 40 full-time members, who were given a small expense stipend on which to live on.<ref name=Bell/> Upon joining, every member received an underground name. The Irgun's members were divided into cells, and worked with the members of their own cells. The identities of Irgun members in other cells were withheld. This ensured that an Irgun member taken prisoner could betray no more than a few comrades.\n\nIn addition to the Irgun's members in Palestine, underground Irgun cells composed of local Jews were established in [[Europe]] following [[World War II]]. An Irgun cell was also established in [[Shanghai]], home to many European-Jewish refugees. The Irgun also set up a Swiss bank account. Eli Tavin, the former head of Irgun intelligence, was appointed commander of the Irgun abroad.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn November 1947, the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] came to an end as the UN approved of the partition of Palestine, and the British had announced their intention to withdraw the previous month. As the British left and the [[1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] got underway, the Irgun came out of the underground and began to function more as a standing army rather an underground organization. It began openly recruiting, training, and raising funds, and established bases, including training facilities. It also introduced field communications and created a medical unit and supply service.<ref>Menachem Begin: ''The Revolt'', ch. 18, ''The Conquest of Jaffa''</ref><ref>Segal, Hagai: ''How My Grandmother Prevented A Civil War'' (2014)</ref>\n\nUntil World War II the group armed itself with weapons purchased in Europe, primarily [[Italy]] and [[Poland]], and smuggled to Palestine. The Irgun also established workshops that manufactured spare parts and attachments for the weapons. Also manufactured were land mines and simple hand grenades. Another way in which the Irgun armed itself was theft of weapons from the [[Palestine Police Force|British Police]] and military.\n\n==Prior to World War II==\n===Founding===\nThe Irgun's first steps were in the aftermath of the [[1929 Palestine riots|Riots of 1929]]. In the [[Jerusalem]] branch of the Haganah there were feelings of disappointment and internal unrest towards the leadership of the movements and the [[Histadrut]] (at that time the organization running the Haganah). These feelings were a result of the view that the Haganah was not adequately defending Jewish interests in the region. Likewise, critics of the leadership spoke out against alleged failures in the number of weapons, readiness of the movement and its policy of restraint and not fighting back. On April 10, 1931, commanders and equipment managers announced that they refused to return weapons to the Haganah that had been issued to them earlier, prior to the [[Nebi Musa]] holiday. These weapons were later returned by the commander of the Jerusalem branch, [[Avraham Tehomi]], a.k.a. \"Gideon\". However, the commanders who decided to rebel against the leadership of the Haganah relayed a message regarding their resignations to the [[Vaad Leumi]], and thus this schism created a new independent movement.\n\nThe leader of the new underground movement was [[Avraham Tehomi]], alongside other founding members who were all senior commanders in the Haganah, members of [[Hapoel Hatzair]] and of the Histadrut. Also among them was [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]], an activist in the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Party]]. This group was known as the \"Odessan Gang\", because they previously had been members of the ''Haganah Ha'Atzmit'' of Jewish [[Odessa]]. The new movement was named ''Irgun Tsvai Leumi'', (\"National Military Organization\") in order to emphasize its active nature in contrast to the Haganah. Moreover, the organization was founded with the desire to become a true military organization and not just a [[militia]] as the Haganah was at the time.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the Jerusalem group merged with other armed groups affiliated with [[Betar]]. The Betar groups' center of activity was in [[Tel Aviv]], and they began their activity in 1928 with the establishment of \"Officers and Instructors School of Betar\". Students at this institution had broken away from the Haganah earlier, for political reasons, and the new group called itself the \"National Defense\", \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea. During the riots of 1929 Betar youth participated in the defense of Tel Aviv neighborhoods under the command of Yermiyahu Halperin, at the behest of the Tel Aviv city hall. After the riots the Tel Avivian group expanded, and was known as \"The [[Right Wing]] Organization\".\n\nAfter the Tel Aviv expansion another branch was established in [[Haifa]]. Towards the end of 1932 the Haganah branch of [[Safed]] also defected and joined the Irgun, as well as many members of the [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] sports association. At that time the movement's underground newsletter, ''Ha'Metsudah'' (the Fortress) also began publication, expressing the active trend of the movement. The Irgun also increased its numbers by expanding draft regiments of Betar \u2013 groups of volunteers, committed to two years of security and pioneer activities. These regiments were based in places that from which stemmed new Irgun strongholds in the many places, including the settlements of [[Yesod HaMa'ala]], [[Mishmar HaYarden]], [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]], [[Metula]] and [[Nahariya]] in the north; in the center \u2013 [[Hadera]], [[Binyamina]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]] and [[Kfar Saba]], and south of there \u2013 [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Rehovot]] and [[Ness Ziona]]. Later on regiments were also active in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] (\"the Kotel Brigades\") among others. Primary training centers were based in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Qastina]] (by [[Kiryat Mal'akhi]] of today) and other places.\n\n===Under Tehomi's command===\n{{Main|1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine}}\n[[File:Tehomi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Avraham Tehomi]], the first Commander of the Irgun]]\nIn 1933 there were some signs of unrest, seen by the incitement of the local Arab leadership to act against the authorities. The strong British response put down the disturbances quickly. During that time the Irgun operated in a similar manner to the Haganah and was a guarding organization. The two organizations cooperated in ways such as coordination of posts and even intelligence sharing.\n\nWithin the Irgun, Tehomi was the first to serve as \"Head of the Headquarters\" or \"Chief Commander\". Alongside Tehomi served the senior commanders, or \"Headquarters\" of the movement. As the organization grew, it was divided into district commands.\n\nIn August 1933 a \"Supervisory Committee\" for the Irgun was established, which included representatives from most of the Zionist political parties. The members of this committee were [[Meir Grossman]] (of the Hebrew State Party), Rabbi [[Meir Bar-Ilan]] (of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Party]], either [[Immanuel Neumann]] or [[Yehoshua Supersky]] (of the [[General Zionists]]) and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] or [[Eliyahu Ben Horin]] (of [[Hatzohar]]).\n\nIn protest against, and with the aim of ending [[Jewish immigration to Palestine]], the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Arab Revolt of 1936\u20131939]] broke out on April 19, 1936. The riots took the form of attacks by Arab rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vandalism. In the beginning, the Irgun and the Haganah generally maintained a policy of restraint, apart from a few instances. Some expressed resentment at this policy, leading up internal unrest in the two organizations. The Irgun tended to retaliate more often, and sometimes Irgun members patrolled areas beyond their positions in order to encounter attackers ahead of time. However, there were differences of opinion regarding what to do in the Haganah, as well. Due to the joining of many [[Betar]] Youth members, Jabotinsky (founder of Betar) had a great deal of influence over Irgun policy. Nevertheless, Jabotinsky was of the opinion that for moral reasons violent retaliation was not to be undertaken.\n\nIn November 1936 the [[Peel Commission]] was sent to inquire regarding the breakout of the riots and propose a solution to end the Revolt. In early 1937 there were still some in the [[Yishuv]] who felt the commission would recommend a partition of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]), thus creating a Jewish state on part of the land. The Irgun leadership, as well as the \"Supervisory Committee\" held similar beliefs, as did some members of the Haganah and the [[Jewish Agency]]. This belief strengthened the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]] and led to the position that there was no room for defense institutions in the future Jewish state. Tehomi was quoted as saying: \"We stand before great events: a Jewish state and a Jewish army. There is a need for a single military force\". This position intensified the differences of opinion regarding the policy of restraint, both within the Irgun and within the political camp aligned with the organization. The leadership committee of the Irgun supported a merger with the Haganah. On April 24, 1937 a referendum was held among Irgun members regarding its continued independent existence. David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern came out publicly in support for the continued existence of the Irgun:\n:''The Irgun has been placed ... before a decision to make, whether to submit to the authority of the government and the [[Jewish Agency]] or to prepare for a double sacrifice and endangerment. Some of our friends do not have appropriate willingness for this difficult position, and have submitted to the Jewish Agency and has left the battle ... all of the attempts ... to unite with the leftist organization have failed, because the Left entered into negotiations not on the basis of unification of forces, but the submission of one such force to the other....''<ref>[[Yosef Kister]], ''The Etzel'', (Hebrew) pp. 38</ref>\n\n===The first split===\nIn April 1937 the Irgun split after the referendum. Approximately 1,500\u20132,000 people, about half of the Irgun's membership, including the senior command staff, regional committee members, along with most of the Irgun's weapons, returned to the Haganah, which at that time was under the Jewish Agency's leadership. The Supervisory Committee's control over the Irgun ended, and Jabotinsky assumed command. In their opinion, the removal of the Haganah from the Jewish Agency's leadership to the national institutions necessitated their return. Furthermore, they no longer saw significant ideological differences between the movements. Those who remained in the Irgun were primarily young activists, mostly laypeople, who sided with the independent existence of the Irgun. In fact, most of those who remained were originally Betar people. [[Moshe Rosenberg]] estimated that approximately 1,800 members remained. In theory, the Irgun remained an organization not aligned with a political party, but in reality the supervisory committee was disbanded and the Irgun's continued ideological path was outlined according to Ze'ev Jabotinsky's school of thought and his decisions, until the movement eventually became Revisionist Zionism's military arm. One of the major changes in policy by Jabotinsky was the end of the policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].\n\nOn April 27, 1937 the Irgun founded a new headquarters, staffed by Moshe Rosenberg at the head, [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] as secretary, [[David Raziel]] as head of the Jerusalem branch, [[Hanoch Kalai]] as commander of Haifa and [[Aharon Haichman]] as commander of Tel Aviv. On 20 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], (June 29) the day of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s death, a ceremony was held in honor of the reorganization of the underground movement. For security purposes this ceremony was held at a construction site in Tel Aviv.\n\nZe'ev Jabotinsky placed Col. [[Robert Bitker]] at the head of the Irgun. Bitker had previously served as Betar commissioner in China and had military experience. A few months later, probably due to total incompatibility with the position, Jabotinsky replaced Bitker with Moshe Rosenberg. When the [[Peel Commission]] report was published a few months later, the Revisionist camp decided not to accept the commission's recommendations. Moreover, the organizations of Betar, [[Hatzohar]] and the Irgun began to increase their efforts to bring Jews to the land of Israel, illegally. This [[Aliyah]] was known as the \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9 \"Af Al Pi (Nevertheless) Aliyah\". As opposed to this position, the Jewish Agency began acting on behalf of the Zionist interest on the political front, and continued the policy of restraint. From this point onwards the differences between the Haganah and the Irgun were much more obvious.\n\n===Illegal immigration===\n[[File:Parita22839.jpg|thumb|The ship [[:he:\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4|''Parita'']] unloading immigrants at the beach in [[Tel Aviv]]]]\nAccording to Jabotinsky's \"Evacuation Plan\", which called for millions of [[European Jews]] to be brought to Palestine at once, the Irgun helped the [[Aliyah Bet|illegal immigration]] of European Jews to the land of Israel. This was named by Jabotinsky the \"National Sport\". The most significant part of this immigration prior to [[World War II]] was carried out by the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] camp, largely because the [[Yishuv]] institutions and the Jewish Agency shied away from such actions on grounds of cost and their belief that Britain would in the future allow widespread Jewish immigration.\n\nThe Irgun joined forces with [[Hatzohar]] and [[Betar]] in September 1937, when it assisted with the landing of a convoy of 54 Betar members at Tantura Beach (near [[Haifa]].) The Irgun was responsible for discreetly bringing the [[Olim]], or Jewish immigrants, to the beaches, and dispersing them among the various Jewish settlements. The Irgun also began participating in the organisation of the immigration enterprise and undertook the process of accompanying the ships. This began with the ship ''Draga'' which arrived at the coast of British Palestine in September 1938. In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Betar representative and [[Hillel Kook]], the Irgun representative, to coordinate the immigration (also known as [[Ha'apala]]). This agreement was also made in the \"Paris Convention\" in February 1939, at which Ze'ev Jabotinsky and David Raziel were present. Afterwards, the \"Aliyah Center\" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Betar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the process.\n\nThe difficult conditions on the ships demanded a high level of discipline. The people on board the ships were often split into units, led by commanders. In addition to having a daily roll call and the distribution of food and water (usually very little of either), organized talks were held to provide information regarding the actual arrival in Palestine. One of the largest ships was the ''Sakaria'', with 2,300 passengers, which equalled about 0.5% of the Jewish population in Palestine. The first vessel arrived on April 13, 1937, and the last on February 13, 1940. All told, about 18,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine with the help of the Revisionist organizations and private initiatives by other Revisionists. Most were not caught by the British.\n\n===End of restraint===\n{{Main|List of Irgun attacks}}\n[[File:David raziel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Raziel]], commander of the Irgun]]\nIrgun members continued to defend settlements, but at the same time began attacks on Arab villages, thus ending the policy of restraint. These attacks were intended to instill fear in the Arab side, in order to cause the Arabs to wish for peace and quiet. In March 1938, [[David Raziel]] wrote in the underground newspaper \"By the Sword\" a constitutive article for the Irgun overall, in which he coined the term '''\"Active Defense\"''':\n:The actions of the Haganah alone will never be a true victory. If the goal of the war is to break the will of the enemy \u2013 and this cannot be attained without destroying his spirit \u2013 clearly we cannot be satisfied with solely defensive operations.... Such a method of defense, that allows the enemy to attack at will, to reorganize and attack again ... and does not intend to remove the enemy's ability to attack a second time \u2013 is called passive defense, and ends in downfall and destruction ... whoever does not wish to be beaten has no choice but to attack. The fighting side, that does not intend to oppress but to save its liberty and honor, he too has only one way available \u2013 the way of attack. Defensiveness by way of offensiveness, in order to deprive the enemy the option of attacking, is called ''active defense''.\n\nThe first attacks began around April 1936, and by the end of World War II, more than 250 Arabs had been killed. Examples include:\n*After an Arab shooting at Carmel school in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the death of a Jewish child, Irgun members attacked an Arab neighborhood near [[Kerem Hatemanim]] in Tel Aviv, killing one Arab man and injuring another.\n*On August 17, the Irgun responded to shootings by Arabs from the [[Jaffa]]\u2013[[Jerusalem]] train towards Jews that were waiting by the train block on Herzl Street in Tel Aviv. The same day, when a Jewish child was injured by the shooting, Irgun members attacked a train on the same route, killing one Arab and injuring five.\nDuring 1936, Irgun members carried out approximately ten attacks.\n\nThroughout 1937 the Irgun continued this line of operation.\n*On March 6, a Jew at Sabbath prayers at the [[Western Wall]] was shot by a local Arab. A few hours later, the Irgun shot at an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rechavia.\n*On June 29, a band of Arabs attacked an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus on the Jerusalem \u2013 Tel Aviv road, killing one Jew. The following day, two Jews were also killed near [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Karkur]]. A few hours later, the Irgun carried out a number of operations.\n**An Arab bus making its way from [[Lifta]] was attacked in Jerusalem.\n**In two other locations in Jerusalem, Arabs were shot as well.\n**In Tel Aviv, a hand grenade was thrown at an Arab coffee shop on Carmel St., injuring many of the patrons.\n**Irgun members also injured an Arab on Reines St. in Tel Aviv.\n**On September 5, the Irgun responded to the murder of a rabbi on his way home from prayer in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] by throwing explosives at an Arab bus that had left Lifta, injuring two female passengers and a British police officer.\n\nA more complete list can be found [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|here]].\n\nAt that time, however, these acts were not yet a part of a formulated policy of the Irgun.<ref>\"Tagar u'Magen (Jabotinsky and the Etzel)\" {{in lang|he}}, Jabtotinsky Publishing, pp. 28</ref> Not all of the aforementioned operations received a commander's approval, and Jabotinsky was not in favor of such actions at the time. Jabotinsky still hoped to establish a Jewish force out in the open that would not have to operate underground. However, the failure, in its eyes, of the [[Peel Commission]] and the renewal of violence on the part of the Arabs caused the Irgun to rethink its official policy.\n\n===Increase in operations===\n14 November 1937 was a watershed in Irgun activity. From that date, the Irgun increased its reprisals. Following an increase in the number of attacks aimed at Jews, including the killing of five [[kibbutz]] members near [[Kiryat Anavim]] (today kibbutz [[Ma'ale HaHamisha]]), the Irgun undertook a series of attacks in various places in Jerusalem, killing five Arabs. Operations were also undertaken in [[Haifa]] (shooting at the Arab-populated [[Wadi Nisnas]] neighborhood) and in [[Herzliya]]. The date is known as the day the policy of restraint ([[Havlagah]]) ended, or as [[Black Sunday, 1937|Black Sunday]] when operations resulted in the murder of 10 Arabs. This is when the organization fully changed its policy, with the approval of Jabotinsky and Headquarters to the policy of \"active defense\" in respect of Irgun actions.<ref>\"The Birth of an Underground Organization\", Yehuda Lapidot, pp. 62 {{in lang|he}}</ref>\n\nThe British responded with the arrest of Betar and Hatzohar members as suspected members of the Irgun. [[Military court]]s were allowed to act under \"Time of Emergency Regulations\" and even sentence people to death. In this manner [[Yehezkel Altman]], a guard in a Betar battalion in the [[Nahalat Yizchak]] neighborhood of Tel Aviv, shot at an Arab bus, without his commanders' knowledge. Altman was acting in response to a shooting at Jewish vehicles on the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem road the day before. He turned himself in later and was sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to a life sentence.\n\nDespite the arrests, Irgun members continued fighting. Jabotinsky lent his moral support to these activities. In a letter to Moshe Rosenberg on 18 March 1938 he wrote:\n:Tell them: from afar I collect and save, as precious treasures, news items about your lives. I know of the obstacles that have not impeded your spirit; and I know of your actions as well. I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with such students.\n\nAlthough the Irgun continued activities such as these, following Rosenberg's orders, they were greatly curtailed. Furthermore, in fear of the British threat of the death sentence for anyone found carrying a weapon, all operations were suspended for eight months. However, opposition to this policy gradually increased. In April, 1938, responding to the killing of six Jews, Betar members from the [[Rosh Pinna|Rosh Pina]] Brigade went on a reprisal mission, without the consent of their commander, as described by historian [[Avi Shlaim]]:\n:On 21 April 1938, after several weeks of planning, he and two of his colleagues from the Irgun (Etzel) ambushed an Arab bus at a bend on a mountain road near Safad. They had a hand grenade, a gun and a pistol. Their plan was to destroy the engine so that the bus would fall off the side of the road and all the passengers would be killed. When the bus approached, they fired at it (not in the air, as Mailer has it) but the grenade lobbed by Ben Yosef did not detonate. The bus with its screaming and terrified passengers drove on.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| title = Bombers not Martyrs\n| author = Avi Shlaim\n| date=  January 6, 2005\n| magazine = London Review of Books\n| url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n01/letters.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the incident ended without casualties, the three were caught, and one of them \u2013 [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] was sentenced to death. Demonstrations around the country, as well as pressure from institutions and people such as [[Haim Weizman|Dr. Chaim Weizmann]] and the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] did not reduce his sentence. In Shlomo Ben-Yosef's writings in Hebrew were later found:\n:I am going to die and I am not sorry at all. Why? Because I am going to die for our country. Shlomo Ben-Yosef.\n\nOn 29 June 1938 he was executed, and was the first of the [[Olei Hagardom]]. The Irgun revered him after his death and many regarded him as an example.\nIn light of this, and due to the anger of the Irgun leadership over the decision to adopt a policy of restraint until that point, Jabotinsky relieved Rosenberg of his post and replaced him with David Raziel, who proved to be the most prominent Irgun commander until [[Menachem Begin]]. Jabotinsky simultaneously instructed the Irgun to end its policy of restraint, leading to armed offensive operations until the end of the Arab Revolt in 1939. In this time, the Irgun mounted about 40 operations against Arabs and Arab villages, for instance:\n*After a Jewish father and son were killed in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], on June 6, 1938, Irgun members threw explosives from the roof of a nearby house, killing two Arabs and injuring four.\n*The Irgun planted [[land mine]]s in a number of Arab [[Souk|markets]], primarily in places identified by the Irgun as activity centers of armed Arab gangs.\n*Explosives detonated in the Arab [[souk]] in Jerusalem on July 15, killed ten local Arabs.\n*In similar circumstances, 70 Arabs were killed by a [[land mine]] planted in the Arab souk in Haifa.\n\nThis action led the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to discuss the disturbances in Palestine. On 23 February 1939 the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Malcolm MacDonald]] revealed the British intention to cancel the mandate and establish a state that would preserve Arab rights. This caused a wave of riots and attacks by Arabs against Jews. The Irgun responded four days later with a series of attacks on Arab buses and other sites. The British used military force against the Arab rioters and in the latter stages of the revolt by the Arab community in Palestine, it deteriorated into a series of internal gang wars.\n\n====During the same period====\n[[File:Irgun poster Erez Jisrael.jpg|thumb|1931 [[propaganda]] poster of the Irgun for distribution in [[central Europe]] \u2013 the map shows Israel defined in the borders of both [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which the Irgun claimed in its entirety for a future Jewish state.]]\n\nAt the same time, the Irgun also established itself in Europe. The Irgun built underground cells that participated in organizing migration to Palestine. The cells were made up almost entirely of Betar members, and their primary activity was military training in preparation for emigration to Palestine. Ties formed with the Polish authorities brought about courses in which Irgun commanders were trained by Polish officers in advanced military issues such as [[guerrilla warfare]], [[Tactic (method)|tactics]] and laying land mines. [[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]] was notable among the cell organizers in Europe. In 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the underground. According to Irgun activists Poland supplied the organization with 25,000 rifles, and additional material and weapons, by summer 1939 the Warsaw warehouses of Irgun held 5,000 rifles and 1,000 machine guns. The training and support by Poland would allow the organization to mobilize 30,000-40,000 men<ref>Perspectives on the Holocaust pp 71-91 The Irgun and the Destruction of European Jewry Yitshaq Ben-Ami page 75-76</ref> The transfer of handguns, rifles, explosives and ammunition stopped with the outbreak of World War II. Another field in which the Irgun operated was the training of pilots, so they could serve in the [[Air Force]] in the future war for independence, in the flight school in [[Lod]].\n\nTowards the end of 1938 there was progress towards aligning the ideologies of the Irgun and the Haganah. Many abandoned the belief that the land would be divided and a Jewish state would soon exist. The Haganah founded \u05e4\u05d5\"\u05de, a special operations unit, (pronounced ''poom''), which carried out reprisal attacks following Arab violence. These operations continued into 1939. Furthermore, the opposition within the [[Yishuv]] to illegal immigration significantly decreased, and the Haganah began to bring Jews to Palestine using rented ships, as the Irgun had in the past.\n\n===First operations against the British===\nThe publishing of the MacDonald [[White Paper of 1939]] brought with it new edicts that were intended to lead to a more equitable settlement between Jews and Arabs. However, it was considered by some Jews to have an adverse effect on the continued development of the Jewish community in Palestine. Chief among these was the prohibition on selling land to Jews, and the smaller quotas for Jewish immigration. The entire Yishuv was furious at the contents of the White Paper. There were demonstrations against the \"Treacherous Paper\", as it was considered that it would preclude the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\nUnder the temporary command of [[Hanoch Kalai]], the Irgun began sabotaging strategic infrastructure such as electricity facilities, radio and telephone lines. It also started publicizing its activity and its goals. This was done in street announcements, newspapers, as well as the underground radio station [[Kol TSion HaLokhemet|Kol Zion HaLochemet]]. On August 26, 1939, the Irgun killed [[Ralph Cairns]], a British police officer who, as head of the Jewish Department in the [[Palestine Police]], had [[torture]]d a number of youths who were underground members.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bell | first = John Bowyer | title = Terror Out of Zion | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year = 1996 | page = 48 | isbn = 9781560008705}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Ben-Yehuda | first = Nahman | title = Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1993 | page = 155 | isbn = 0791411664}}</ref> Cairns and Ronald Barker, another British police officer, were killed by an Irgun [[improvised explosive device|IED]].<ref>\"Mine Explosion In Jerusalem.\" OUR CORRESPONDENT, The Times [London, England] 28 Aug. 1939: 12.

On the next day, September 1, 1939, World War II broke out.\n\n==During World War II==\nFollowing the outbreak of war, Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the [[New Zionist Organization]] voiced their support for Britain and France. In mid-September 1939 Raziel was moved from his place of detention in [[Tzrifin]]. This, among other events, encouraged the Irgun to announce a cessation of its activities against the British so as not to hinder Britain's effort to fight \"the Hebrew's greatest enemy in the world \u2013 German [[Nazism]]\". This announcement ended with the hope that after the war a Hebrew state would be founded \"within the historical borders of the liberated homeland\". After this announcement Irgun, Betar and Hatzohar members, including Raziel and the Irgun leadership, were gradually released from detention. The Irgun did not rule out joining the British army and the [[Jewish Brigade]]. Irgun members did enlist in various British units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgun.html |title=Irgun Zeva'i Le'umi\u2014\"The National Military Organization\" (Etzel, I.Z.L.) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Irgun members also assisted British forces with intelligence in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. An Irgun unit also operated in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. David Raziel later died during one of these operations.\n\nDuring the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Betar members revolted numerous times against the Nazis in [[occupied Europe]]. The largest of these revolts was the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], in which an armed underground organization fought, formed by Betar and Hatzoar and known as the ''[[Jewish Military Union (League)|\u017bydowski Zwi\u0105zek Wojskowy]] (\u017bZW)'' (Jewish Military Union). Despite its political origins, the \u017bZW accepted members without regard to political affiliation, and had contacts established before the war with elements of the Polish military. Because of differences over objectives and strategy, the \u017bZW was unable to form a common front with the mainstream ghetto fighters of the [[Jewish Combat Organization|\u017bydowska Organizacja Bojowa]], and fought independently under the military leadership of [[Pawe\u0142 Frenkiel]] and the political leadership of [[Dawid Wdowi\u0144ski]].<ref>See Chaim Lazar, ''Matsada shel Varsha'' (Tel Aviv: Machon Jabotinsky, 1963), David Wdowi\u0144ski, (1963), ''And we are not saved.''

In July 1943 the \"Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People in Europe\" was formed, and worked until the end of the war to rescue the [[Jews of Europe]] from the Nazis and to garner public support for a Jewish state. However, it was not until January 1944 that [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] established the [[War Refugee Board]], which achieved some success in saving European Jews.\n\n===Second split===\n[[File:Avraham Stern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Avraham Stern|Avraham (Yair) Stern]]]]\nThroughout this entire period, the British continued enforcing the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]]'s provisions, which included a ban on the sale of land, restrictions on Jewish immigration and increased vigilance against illegal immigration. Part of the reason why the British banned land sales (to anyone) was the confused state of the post Ottoman land registry; it was difficult to determine who actually owned the land that was for sale.\n\nWithin the ranks of the Irgun this created much disappointment and unrest, at the center of which was disagreement with the leadership of the [[New Zionist Organization]], David Raziel and the Irgun Headquarters. On June 18, 1939, Avraham (Yair) Stern and others of the leadership were released from prison and a rift opened between them the Irgun and Hatzohar leadership. The controversy centred on the issues of the underground movement submitting to public political leadership and fighting the British. On his release from prison Raziel resigned from Headquarters. To his chagrin, independent operations of senior members of the Irgun were carried out and some commanders even doubted Raziel's loyalty.\n\nIn his place, Stern was elected to the leadership. In the past, Stern had founded secret Irgun cells in Poland without Jabotinsky's knowledge, in opposition to his wishes. Furthermore, Stern was in favor of removing the Irgun from the authority of the New Zionist Organization, whose leadership urged Raziel to return to the command of the Irgun. He finally consented. Jabotinsky wrote to Raziel and to Stern, and these letters were distributed to the branches of the Irgun:\n\n:... I call upon you: Let nothing disturb our unity. Listen to the commissioner (Raziel), whom I trust, and promise me that you and [[Betar]], the greatest of my life's achievements, will stand strong and united and allow me to continue with the hope for victory in the war to realize our old [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] dream....\n\nStern was sent a telegram with an order to obey Raziel, who was reappointed. However, these events did not prevent the splitting of the organization. Suspicion and distrust were rampant among the members. Out of the Irgun a new organization was created on July 17, 1940,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac05.htm |title=The Split Within The Irgun |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> which was first named \"The National Military Organization in Israel\" (as opposed to the \"National Military Organization in '''the Land of''' Israel\") and later on changed its name to [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], an acronym for '''Lohamei Herut Israel''', \"Fighters for the Freedom of Israel\", (\u05dc\u05d7\"\u05d9 \u2013 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc). Jabotinsky died in [[New York (state)|New York]] on August 4, 1940, yet this did not prevent the Lehi split. Following Jabotinsky's death, ties were formed between the Irgun and the [[New Zionist Organization]]. These ties would last until 1944, when the Irgun declared a revolt against the British.\n\nThe primary difference between the Irgun and the newly formed organization was its intention to fight the British in Palestine, regardless of their war against Germany. Later, additional operational and ideological differences developed that contradicted some of the Irgun's guiding principles. For example, the Lehi, unlike the Irgun, supported a [[population exchange]] with local Arabs.\n\n===Change of policy===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float: right; border: 1px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 6px; font-size: 95%; margin: 8px 25px 8px 2px;\"\n| style=\"background: #ccf; text-align: center;\" | The Irgun's Anthem<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betar.org.il/en/content/view/9/6/ |title=World Zionist youth movement - Shir |publisher=Betar |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n|-\n|\nTagar -<br>\nThrough all obstacles and enemies<br>\nWhether you go up or down<br>\nIn the flames of revolt<br>\nCarry a flame to kindle \u2013 never mind!<br>\nFor silence is filth<br>\nWorthless is blood and soul<br>\nFor the sake of the hidden glory\n\nTo die or to conquer the hill -<br>\nYodefet, Masada, Betar.\n|}\nThe split damaged the Irgun both organizationally and from a morale point of view. As their spiritual leader, Jabotinsky's death also added to this feeling. Together, these factors brought about a mass abandonment by members. The British took advantage of this weakness to gather intelligence and arrest Irgun activists. The new Irgun leadership, which included Meridor, Yerachmiel Ha'Levi, [[Moshe Zvi Segal (Rabbi)|Rabbi Moshe Zvi Segal]] and others used the forced hiatus in activity to rebuild the injured organization. This period was also marked by more cooperation between the Irgun and the Jewish Agency, however [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s uncompromising demand that Irgun accept the Agency's command foiled any further cooperation.\n\nIn both the Irgun and the Haganah more voices were being heard opposing any cooperation with the British. Nevertheless, an Irgun operation carried out in the service of Britain was aimed at sabotaging pro-Nazi forces in [[Iraq]], including the assassination of [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]]. Among others, Raziel and [[Yaakov Meridor]] participated. On April 20, 1941, during a [[Luftwaffe]] air raid on [[Habbaniya Airport|RAF Hannaniya]] near [[Baghdad]], David Raziel, commander of the Irgun, was killed during the operation.\n\nIn late 1943 a joint Haganah \u2013 Irgun initiative was developed, to form a single fighting body, unaligned with any political party, by the name of \u05e2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd (''Fighting Nation'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmach.org.il/|title=\u05d3\u05e3 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea|website=www.palmach.org.il|access-date=2007-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830212132/http://www.palmach.org.il/|archive-date=2012-08-30|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/1146 |title=Reflections on the assassination of Sheikh Yassin |publisher=Fromoccupiedpalestine.org}}</ref> The new body's first plan was to kidnap the British High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]] and take him to [[Cyprus]]. However, the Haganah leaked the planned operation and it was thwarted before it got off the ground. Nevertheless, at this stage the Irgun ceased its cooperation with the British. As [[Eliyahu Lankin]] tells in his book:\n:Immediately following the failure of ''Fighting Nation'' practical discussions began in the Irgun Headquarters regarding a declaration of war.\n\n==The Revolt==\nIn 1943 the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]], commanded by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders]], arrived in Palestine from [[Iraq]]. The British insisted that no Jewish units of the army be created. Eventually, many of the soldiers of Jewish origin that arrived with the army were released and allowed to stay in Palestine. One of them was [[Menachem Begin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sullivan/bios/MenachemBegin-Bio.html|title=Menachem Begin Biography|website=www.ibiblio.org}}</ref> whose arrival in Palestine created new-found expectations within the Irgun and Betar. Begin had served as head of the Betar movement in [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/begin-bio.html |title=Menachem Begin \u2013 Biography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> and was a respected leader. [[Yaakov Meridor]], then the commander of the Irgun, raised the idea of appointing Begin to the post. In late 1943, when Begin accepted the position, a new leadership was formed. Meridor became Begin's deputy, and other members of the board were Aryeh Ben Eliezer, Eliyahu Lankin, and Shlomo Lev Ami.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/irgunrevolt.html|title=The Revolt is Proclaimed by the Irgun|last=Lapidot|first=Yehuda|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 1944 the Irgun put up posters all around the country, proclaiming a revolt against the British mandatory government. The posters began by saying that all of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movements stood by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] and over 25,000 Jews had enlisted in the British military. The hope to establish a Jewish army had died. European Jewry was trapped and was being destroyed, yet Britain, for its part, did not allow any rescue missions. This part of the document ends with the following words:\n:[[MacDonald White Paper|The White Paper]] is still in effect. It is enforced, despite the betrayal of the Arabs and the loyalty of the Jews; despite the mass enlisting to the British Army; despite the [[ceasefire]] and the quiet in The Land of Israel; despite the massacre of masses of the Jewish people in Europe....\n\n:The facts are simple and horrible as one. Over the last four years of [[World War II|the war]] we have lost millions of the best of our people; millions more are in danger of eradication. And The Land of Israel is closed off and quarantined because the British rule it, realizing the White Paper, and strives for the destruction of our people's last hope.\n\nThe Irgun then declared that, for its part, the ceasefire was over and they were now at war with the British. It demanded the transfer of rule to a Jewish government, to implement ten policies. Among these were the mass evacuation of Jews from Europe, the signing of treaties with any state that recognized the Jewish state's sovereignty, including Britain, granting social justice to the state's residents, and full equality to the Arab population. The proclamation ended with:\n:The God of Israel, God of Hosts, will be at our side. There is no retreat. Liberty or death.... The fighting youth will not recoil in the face of sacrifices and suffering, blood and torment. They will not surrender, so long as our days of old are not renewed, so long as our nation is not ensured a homeland, liberty, honor, bread, justice and law.\n\nThe Irgun began this campaign rather weakly. At the time of the start of the revolt, it was only about 1,000 strong, including some 200 fighters. It possessed about 4 submachine guns, 40 rifles, 60 pistols, 150 hand grenades, and 2,000 kilograms of explosive material, and its funds were about \u00a3800.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\n===Struggle against the British===\n{{Main|Jewish insurgency in Palestine}}\nThe Irgun began a militant operation against the symbols of government, in an attempt to harm the regime's operation as well as its reputation. The first attack was on February 12, 1944 at the government immigration offices, a symbol of the immigration laws. The attacks went smoothly and ended with no casualties\u2014as they took place on a Saturday night, when the buildings were empty\u2014in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. On February 27 the income tax offices were bombed. Parts of the same cities were blown up, also on a Saturday night; prior warnings were put up near the buildings. On March 23 the national headquarters building of the British police in the [[Migrash Harusim|Russian Compound]] in Jerusalem was attacked, and part of it was blown up. These attacks in the first few months were sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv and by the Jewish Agency, who saw them as dangerous provocations.\n\nAt the same time the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] also renewed its attacks against the British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+Eight+The+Struggle+for+the+Establishment+of+the+State+of+Israel.htm |title=Chapter Eight: The Struggle for the Establishment of the State of Israel |publisher=Jewishagency.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> The Irgun continued to attack police stations and headquarters, and [[Tegart fort|Tegart Fort]], a fortified police station (today the location of [[Latrun]]). One relatively complex operation was the takeover of the radio station in [[Ramallah]], on May 17, 1944.\n\nOne symbolic act by the Irgun happened before [[Yom Kippur]] of 1944. They plastered notices around town, warning that no British officers should come to the [[Western Wall]] on Yom Kippur, and for the first time since the mandate began no British police officers were there to prevent the Jews from the traditional [[Shofar]] blowing at the end of the fast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/hayom/2a-2.htm|title=\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05e8\u05d3|website=www.daat.ac.il}}</ref> After the fast that year the Irgun attacked four police stations in Arab settlements. In order to obtain weapons, the Irgun carried out \"confiscation\" operations \u2013 they robbed British armouries and smuggled stolen weapons to their own hiding places. During this phase of activity the Irgun also cut all of its official ties with the [[New Zionist Organization]], so as not to tie their fate in the underground organization.\n\nBegin wrote in his [[memoir]]s, ''[[The Revolt]]'':\n:History and experience taught us that if we are able to destroy the prestige of the British in Palestine, the regime will break. Since we found the enslaving government's weak point, we did not let go of it.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The Revolt\n| url = https://archive.org/details/revolt00mena\n| url-access = registration\n| author = Menachem Begin\n| year=  1977}}</ref>\n\n===Underground exiles===\n{{Main|Irgun and Lehi internment in Africa}}\nIn October 1944 the British began expelling hundreds of arrested Irgun and Lehi members to detention camps in [[Africa]]. 251 detainees from [[Latrun]] were flown on thirteen planes, on October 19 to a camp in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. Eleven additional transports were made. Throughout the period of their detention, the detainees often initiated rebellions and hunger strikes. Many escape attempts were made until July 1948 when the exiles were returned to Israel. While there were numerous successful escapes from the camp itself, only nine men actually made it back all the way. One noted success was that of [[Yaakov Meridor]], who escaped nine times before finally reaching Europe in April 1948. These tribulations were the subject of his book ''Long is the Path to Freedom: Chronicles of one of the Exiles''.\n\n===Hunting Season===\n{{Main|The Hunting Season}}\nOn November 6, 1944, [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], British Deputy Resident Minister of State in [[Cairo]] was assassinated by Lehi members [[Eliyahu Hakim]] and [[Eliyahu Bet-Zuri]]. This act raised concerns within the Yishuv from the British regime's reaction to the underground's violent acts against them. Therefore, the Jewish Agency decided on starting a ''Hunting Season'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac07.htm |title=The 'Hunting Season' |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/history/lapidot/8.htm |title=Besiege / Yehuda Lapidut \u2013 The Hunting Season |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> known as the ''saison'', (from the [[French language|French]] \"la saison de chasse\").\n\nThe Irgun's recuperation was noticeable when it began to renew its cooperation with the Lehi in May 1945, when it sabotaged oil pipelines, telephone lines and railroad bridges. All in all, over 1,000 members of the Irgun and Lehi were arrested and interned in British camps during the ''Saison''. Eventually the Hunting Season died out, and there was even talk of cooperation with the Haganah leading to the formation of the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]].\n\n===The Jewish Resistance Movement===\n{{Main|The Jewish Resistance Movement}}\n[[File:KD 1946.JPG|thumb|The King David Hotel after the bombing, photo from [[The Jerusalem Post|''The Palestine Post'']]]]\n\nTowards the end of July 1945 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] in Britain was elected to power. The Yishuv leadership had high hopes that this would change the anti-Zionist policy that the British maintained at the time. However, these hopes were quickly dashed when the government limited Jewish immigration, with the intention that the population of [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) would not be more than one third of the total. This, along with the stepping up of arrests and their pursuit of underground members and illegal immigration organizers led to the formation of the [[The Jewish Resistance Movement|Jewish Resistance Movement]]. This body consolidated the armed resistance to the British of the Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah. For ten months the Irgun and the Lehi cooperated and they carried out nineteen attacks and defense operations. The Haganah and Palmach carried out ten such operations. The Haganah also assisted in landing 13,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nTension between the underground movements and the British increased with the increase in operations. On April 23, 1946, an operation undertaken by the Irgun to gain weapons from the [[Tegart fort]] at [[Ramat Gan]] resulted in a firefight with the police in which an Arab constable and two Irgun fighters were killed, including one who jumped on an explosive device to save his comrades. A third fighter, [[Dov Gruner]], was wounded and captured. He stood trial and was sentenced to be death by hanging, refusing to sign a pardon request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac14.htm |title=The Gallows |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, British relations with the Yishuv worsened, building up to [[Operation Agatha]] of June 29. The authorities ignored the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]'s recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews into Palestine at once. As a result of the discovery of documents tying the Jewish Agency to the Jewish Resistance Movement, the Irgun was asked to speed up the plans for the [[King David Hotel bombing]] of July 22.<ref>Jabotinsky Institute Archives (k-4 1/11/5)</ref> The hotel was where the documents were located, the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|Criminal Investigation Division]] of the police. The Irgun later claimed to have sent a warning that was ignored.<ref>Menachem Begin, ''The Revolt''. 1951, p. 221</ref> Palestinian and U.S. sources confirm that the Irgun issued numerous warnings for civilians to evacuate the hotel prior to the bombing.<ref name=\"Abrahms\"/> 91 people were killed in the attack where a 350&nbsp;kg bomb was placed in the basement of the hotel and caused a large section of it to collapse. Only 13 were British soldiers.\n\n===Further struggle against the British===\n[[File:Menahem Begin during his \"Rabbi Sassover\" period with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] as \"Rabbi Sassover\", with wife Aliza and son Benyamin-Zeev, Tel Aviv, December 1946]]\n\nThe King David Hotel bombing and the arrest of Jewish Agency and other Yishuv leaders as part of [[Operation Agatha]] caused the Haganah to cease their armed activity against the British. Yishuv and Jewish Agency leaders were released from prison. From then until the end of the British mandate, resistance activities were led by the Irgun and Lehi. In early September 1946 the Irgun renewed its attacks against civil structures, railroads, communication lines and bridges. One operation was the attack on the train station in Jerusalem, in which [[Meir Feinstein]] was arrested and later committed suicide awaiting execution. According to the Irgun these sort of armed attacks were legitimate, since the trains primarily served the British, for redeployment of their forces. The Irgun also publicized leaflets, in three languages, not to use specific trains in danger of being attacked. For a while the British stopped train traffic at night. The Irgun also carried out repeated attacks against military and police traffic using disguised, electronically-detonated roadside mines which could be detonated by an operator hiding nearby as a vehicle passed, carried out arms raids against military bases and police stations (often disguised as British soldiers), launched bombing, shooting, and mortar attacks against military and police installations and checkpoints, and robbed banks to gain funds as a result of losing access to Haganah funding following the collapse of the Jewish Resistance Movement.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nOn October 31, 1946, in response to the British barring entry of Jews from Palestine, the Irgun [[1946 British Embassy bombing|blew up the British Embassy]] in [[Rome]], a center of British efforts to monitor and stop Jewish immigration. The Irgun also carried out a few other operations in Europe: a British troop train was derailed and an attempt against another troop train failed. An attack on a British officers club in [[Vienna]] took place in 1947, and an attack on another British officer's club in Vienna and a sergeant's club in [[Germany]] took place in 1948.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn December 1946 a sentence of 18 years and 18 beatings was handed down to a young Irgun member for robbing a bank. The Irgun made good on a threat they made<ref>{{cite news|title=FLOGGING SENTENCE|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2703695|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=25 December 1946|quote=He was convicted following a bank hold-up In September.  Irgun Zvai Leumi broadcast a threat that if the sentence were confirmed, British Army officers would be flogged in retaliation.}}</ref>  and after the detainee was whipped, Irgun members kidnapped British officers and beat them in public. The operation, known as the \"[[Night of the Beatings]]\" brought an end to British punitive beatings. The British, taking these acts seriously, moved many British families in Palestine into the confines of military bases, and some moved home.\n\n[[File:Bombe Irgoun 29 dec 1947.jpg|thumb|left|Arab bus after a bomb attack by the Irgun, 29 December 1947]]\nOn February 14, 1947, [[Ernest Bevin]] announced that the Jews and Arabs would not be able to agree on any British proposed solution for the land, and therefore the issue must be brought to the [[United Nations]] (UN) for a final decision. The Yishuv thought of the idea to transfer the issue to the UN as a British attempt to achieve delay while a UN inquiry commission would be established, and its ideas discussed, and all the while the Yishuv would weaken. [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet|Foundation for Immigration B]] increased the number of ships bringing in Jewish refugees. The British still strictly enforced the policy of limited Jewish immigration and illegal immigrants were placed in detention camps in [[Cyprus]], which increased the anger of the Jewish community towards the mandate government.\n\nThe Irgun stepped up its activity and from February 19 until March 3 it attacked 18 British military camps, convoy routes, vehicles, and other facilities. The most notable of these attacks was the bombing of a British officer's club located in Goldsmith House in Jerusalem, which was in a heavily guarded security zone. Covered by machine-gun fire, an Irgun assault team in a truck penetrated the security zone and lobbed explosives into the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac12.htm |title=The Raid On The Jerusalem Officers Club |publisher=Etzel.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref> Thirteen people, including two officers, were killed.<ref name=Hoffman/> As a result, martial law was imposed over much of the country, enforced by approximately 20,000 British soldiers. Despite this, attacks continued throughout the martial law period. The most notable one was an Irgun attack against the Royal Army Pay Corps base at the [[Schneller Orphanage]], in which a British soldier was killed.<ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nThroughout its struggle against the British, the Irgun sought to publicize its cause around the world. By humiliating the British, it attempted to focus global attention on Palestine, hoping that any British overreaction would be widely reported, and thus result in more political pressure against the British. Begin described this strategy as turning Palestine into a \"glass house\". The Irgun also re-established many representative offices internationally, and by 1948 operated in 23 states. In these countries the Irgun sometimes acted against the local British representatives or led public relations campaigns against Britain. According to [[Bruce Hoffman]]: \"''In an era long before the advent of 24/7 global news coverage and instantaneous satellite-transmitted broadcasts, the Irgun deliberately attempted to appeal to a worldwide audience far beyond the immediate confines of its local struggle, and beyond even the ruling regime's own homeland''.\"<ref name=Bell/><ref name=Hoffman/>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"7\" style=\"float: right; border: 4px solid #8888aa; background: #f7f8ff; padding: 5px; font-size: 95%; margin: 10px 30px 10px 4px;\"\n| style=\"background: #ccf; text-align: center;\" | [[Olei Hagardom|Executed Members of the Irgun]]\n|-\n|\n*[[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]]\n*[[Dov Gruner]]\n*[[Mordechai Alkahi]]\n*[[Yehiel Dresner]]\n*[[Eliezer Kashani]]\n*[[Yaakov Weiss]]\n*[[Avshalom Haviv]]\n*[[Meir Nakar]]\n|}\n\n===The Acre Prison break===\n{{Main|Acre Prison break}}\nOn April 16, 1947, Irgun members Dov Gruner, Yehiel Dresner, Eliezer Kashani, and Mordechai Alkahi were hanged in [[Acre Prison]], while singing [[Hatikvah]]. On April 21 [[Meir Feinstein]] and Lehi member [[Moshe Barazani]] blew themselves up, using a smuggled grenade, hours before their scheduled hanging. And on May 4 one of the Irgun's largest operations took place \u2013 the raid on Acre Prison. The operation was carried out by 23 men, commanded by Dov Cohen \u2013 AKA \"Shimshon\", along with the help of the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] prisoners inside the prison. The Irgun had informed them of the plan in advance and smuggled in explosives. After a hole was blasted in the prison wall, the 41 Irgun and Lehi members who had been chosen to escape then ran to the hole, blasting through inner prison gates with the smuggled explosives. Meanwhile, Irgun teams mined roads and launched a mortar attack on a nearby British Army camp to delay the arrival of responding British forces. Although the 41 escapees managed to get out of the prison and board the escape trucks, some were rapidly recaptured and nine of the escapees and attackers were killed. Five Irgun men in the attacking party were also captured. Overall, 27 of the 41 designated escapees managed to escape. Along with the underground movement members, other criminals \u2013 including 214 Arabs<ref>Horne, Edward (1982). A Job Well Done (Being a History of The Palestine Police Force 1920\u20131948).

British forces closed off and combed the area in search of the two, but did not find them. On July 29, 1947, in the afternoon, Meir Nakar, Avshalom Haviv, and Yaakov Weiss were executed. Approximately thirteen hours later the hostages were hanged in retaliation by the Irgun and their bodies, booby-trapped with an explosive, afterwards strung up from trees in woodlands south of Netanya. This action caused an outcry in Britain and was condemned both there and by Jewish leaders in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887512,00.html |title=Eye for an Eye for an Eye, Time Magazine.

The [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)]] was also influenced by this and other actions. At the same time another incident was developing \u2013 the events of the ship [[Exodus (ship)|''Exodus 1947'']]. The 4,500 Holocaust survivors on board were not allowed to enter Palestine. UNSCOP also covered the events. Some of its members were even present at [[Haifa]] port when the putative immigrants were forcefully removed from their ship (later found to have been rigged with an IED by some of its passengers) onto the deportation ships, and later commented that this strong image helped them press for an immediate solution for Jewish immigration and the question of Palestine.\n\nTwo weeks later, the House of Commons convened for a special debate on events in Palestine, and concluded that their soldiers should be withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\n==The 1948 Palestine War==\n{{Main|1948 Palestine War}}\n[[File:\u05d1\u05d2\u05d9\u05df (\u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6) \u05e2\u05dd \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]] with Irgun members, 1948]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1102 Israel Defense Forces \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e6\"\u05dc \u05d1\u05e9\u05e2\u05ea \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7.jpg|thumb|Irgun fighters training in 1947]]\n[[File:Mitzad.jpg|thumb|Irgun parade in 1948]]\n\nUNSCOP's conclusion was a unanimous decision to end the British mandate, and a majority decision to divide [[Mandatory Palestine]] (the land west of the [[Jordan River]]) between a Jewish state and an Arab state. During the UN's deliberations regarding the committee's recommendations the Irgun avoided initiating any attacks, so as not to influence the UN negatively on the idea of a Jewish state. On November 29 the [[UN General Assembly]] voted in favor of ending the mandate and [[1947 UN Partition Plan|establishing two states]] on the land. That very same day the Irgun and the Lehi renewed their attacks on British targets. The next day the local Arabs began attacking the Jewish community, thus beginning the first stage of the [[1948 Palestine War]]. The first attacks on Jews were in Jewish neighborhoods of [[Jerusalem]], in and around [[Jaffa]], and in [[Bat Yam]], [[Holon]], and the [[Ha'Tikvah]] neighborhood in [[Tel Aviv]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1947, the Irgun had approximately 4,000 members. The goal of the organization at that point was the conquest of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea for the future Jewish state, and preventing Arab forces from driving out the Jewish community. The Irgun became almost an overt organization, establishing military bases in [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Petah Tikva]]. It began recruiting openly, thus significantly increasing in size. During the war the Irgun fought alongside the Lehi and the Haganah in the front against the Arab attacks. At first the Haganah maintained a defensive policy, as it had until then, but after the [[Convoy of 35]] incident it completely abandoned its policy of restraint: \"Distinguishing between individuals is no longer possible, for now \u2013 it is a war, and the even the innocent shall not be absolved.\"<ref>Netanel Lorch. ''The Edge of the Sword: Israel's War of Independence, 1947-1949'', Massada Publishing, 1958. pp. 85 {{in lang|he}}</ref>\n\nThe Irgun also began carrying out reprisal missions, as it had under David Raziel's command. At the same time though, it published announcements calling on the Arabs to lay down their weapons and maintain a ceasefire:\n:The National Military Organization has warned you, if the murderous attacks on Jewish civilians shall continue, its soldiers will penetrate your centers of activity and plague you. You have not heeded the warning. You continued to harm our brothers and murder them in wild cruelty. Therefore soldiers of the National Military Organization will go on the attack, as we have warned you.\n\n:... However even in these frenzied times, when Arab and Jewish blood is spilled at the British enslaver, we hereby call upon you ... to stop the attacks and create peace between us. We do not want a war with you. We are certain that neither do you want a war with us...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/begin/47_20-2.htm |title=Petition of Our Arab Neighbors: Announcement in Arabic to the Arab Rioters |language=Hebrew |publisher=Daat.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\nHowever the mutual attacks continued. The Irgun attacked the Arab villages of [[Al-Tira (Haifa)|Tira]] near [[Haifa]], [[Yehudiya]] ('Abassiya) in the center, and [[Shuafat]] by Jerusalem. The Irgun also attacked in the [[Wadi Rushmiya]] neighborhood in Haifa and [[Abu Kabir]] in Jaffa. On December 29 Irgun units arrived by boat to the Jaffa shore and a gunfight between them and Arab gangs ensued. The following day a bomb was thrown from a speeding Irgun car at a group of Arab men waiting to be hired for the day at the Haifa oil refinery, resulting in seven Arabs killed, and dozens injured. In response, some Arab workers [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre|attacked Jews in the area]], killing 41. This sparked a Haganah response in [[Balad al-Shaykh raid|Balad al-Sheykh]], which resulted in the deaths of 60 civilians. The Irgun's goal in the fighting was to move the battles from Jewish populated areas to Arab populated areas. On January 1, 1948 the Irgun attacked again in Jaffa, its men wearing British uniforms; later in the month it attacked in [[Beit Nabala]], a base for many Arab fighters. On 5 January 1948 the Irgun detonated a lorry bomb outside Jaffa's Ottoman built Town Hall, killing 14 and injuring 19.<ref>''[[The Scotsman]]'', 6 January 1948; Walid Khalidi states that 25 civilians were killed.

Their objective was \"to prevent constant military traffic in the city, to break the spirit of the enemy troops [and] to cause chaos among the civilian population in order to create a mass flight.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morris, 2004, 'The Birth ... Revisited', p. 213</ref> High Commissioner Cunningham wrote a few days later \"It should be made clear that IZL attack with mortars was indiscriminate and designed to create panic among the civilian inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The British demanded the evacuation of the newly conquered city, and militarily intervened, ending the Irgun offensive. Heavy British shelling against Irgun positions in Jaffa failed to dislodge them, and when British armor pushed into the city, the Irgun resisted; a bazooka team managed to knock out one tank, buildings were blown up and collapsed onto the streets as the armor advanced, and Irgun men crawled up and tossed live dynamite sticks onto the tanks. The British withdrew, and opened negotiations with the Jewish authorities.<ref name=Bell/> An agreement was worked out, under which Operation Hametz would be stopped and the Haganah would not attack Jaffa until the end of the Mandate. The Irgun would evacuate Manshiya, with Haganah fighters replacing them. British troops would patrol its southern end and occupy the police fort. The Irgun had previously agreed with the Haganah that British pressure would not lead to withdrawal from Jaffa and that custody of captured areas would be turned over to the Haganah. The city ultimately fell on May 13 after Haganah forces entered the city and took control of the rest of the city, from the south \u2013 part of the ''Hametz Operation'' which included the conquest of a number of villages in the area. The battles in Jaffa were a great victory for the Irgun. This operation was the largest in the history of the organization, which took place in highly built up area that had many militants in shooting positions. During the battles explosives were used in order to break into homes and continue forging a way though them. Furthermore, this was the first occasion in which the Irgun had directly fought British forces, reinforced with armor and heavy weaponry. The city began these battles with an Arab population estimated at 70,000, which shrank to some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities. Since the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya on its own, causing the flight of many of Jaffa's residents, the Irgun took credit for the conquest of Jaffa. It had lost 42 dead and about 400 wounded during the battle.<ref name=Bell/>\n\n==Integration with the IDF and the Altalena Affair==\n{{Main|Altalena Affair}}\n\nOn May 14, 1948 [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|the establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] was proclaimed. The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), and the process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF started. On June 1, an agreement had been signed Between [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yisrael Galili]] for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF. One of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to stop smuggling arms. Meanwhile, in France, Irgun representatives purchased a ship, renamed ''[[Altalena]]'' (a pseudonym of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]), and weapons. The ship sailed on June 11 and arrived at the Israeli coast on June 20, during the first truce of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Despite [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 50]] declared an arms embargo in the region, neither side respected it.<ref>(Benny (2008), \"1948: The First Arab-Israeli War\", Yale University Press, New Haven, pp. 269\u201371, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12696-9}}).[[Mordechai Weingarten]]</ref>\n\nWhen the ship arrived the Israeli government, headed by Ben-Gurion, was adamant in its demand that the Irgun surrender and hand over all of the weapons. Ben-Gurion said: \"We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.\"\n\n[[File:Altalena off Tel-Aviv beach.jpg|thumb|left|''Altalena'' on fire after the Israeli government quelling of the Irgun's attempt to smuggle weapons]]\nThere were two confrontations between the newly formed IDF and the Irgun: when ''Altalena'' reached [[Kfar Vitkin]] in the late afternoon of Sunday, June 20 many Irgun militants, including Begin, waited on the shore. A clash with the [[Alexandroni Brigade]], commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), occurred. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties on both sides. The clash ended in a ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander, and with the ship, now reinforced with local Irgun members, including Begin, sailing to Tel Aviv, where the Irgun had more supporters.\nMany Irgun members, who joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and concentrated on the Tel Aviv beach. A confrontation between them and the IDF units started. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered [[Yigael Yadin]] (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the ''Altalena''. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn.\nSixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army; six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on [[Tel Aviv beach]]. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.\n\nAfter the shelling of the ''Altalena'', more than 200 Irgun fighters were arrested. Most of them were freed several weeks later. The Irgun militants were then fully integrated with the IDF and not kept in separate units.\n\nThe initial agreement for the integration of the Irgun into the IDF did not include [[Jerusalem]], where a small remnant of the Irgun called the ''Jerusalem Battalion'', numbering around 400 fighters, and Lehi, continued to operate independently of the government. Following the assassination of UN Envoy for Peace [[Folke Bernadotte]] by Lehi in September 1948, the Israeli government determined to immediately dismantle the underground organizations. An ultimatum was issued to the Irgun to liquidate as an independent organization and integrate into the IDF or be destroyed, and Israeli troops surrounded the Irgun camp in the Katamon Quarter of Jerusalem. The Irgun accepted the ultimatum on September 22, 1948, and shortly afterward the remaining Irgun fighters in Jerusalem began enlisting in the IDF and turning over their arms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19480923&id=13ssAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3395,2171340&hl=en|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref><ref>[https://www.jta.org/1948/09/22/archive/irgunists-in-jerusalem-surrender-their-arms-to-govt-dissidents-to-join-army-today Irgunists in Jerusalem Surrender Their Arms to Govt; Dissidents to Join Army Today] 22 September 1948, ''www.jta.org'', accessed 29 September 2019</ref> At Begin's orders, the Irgun in the diaspora formally disbanded on January 12, 1949, with the Irgun's former Paris headquarters becoming the European bureau of the [[Herut]] movement.\n\n== Propaganda ==\nIn order to increase the popularity of the Irgun organization and ideology, Irgun employed propaganda. This propaganda was mainly aimed at the British, and included the idea of [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]]. According to Irgun [[:File:Irgun_poster_Erez_Jisrael.jpg|propaganda posters]], the Jewish state was not only to encompass all of [[Mandatory Palestine]], but also [[The Emirate of Transjordan]].<ref name=\"Irgun Documentation\">{{cite book|last1=Tavin and Alexander|first1=Eli and Yonah|title=Psychological Warfare and Propaganda: Irgun Documentation|publisher=Scholarly Resources Inc.|isbn=0-8420-2188-4}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Labour party came into power in Britain in July 1945, Irgun published an announcement entitled, \"We shall give the Labour Government a Chance to Keep Its Word.\" In this publication, Irgun stated, \"Before it came to power, this Party undertook to return the Land of Israel to the people of Israel as a free state...

The plaques, in their original version, read:\n\nWarning phone calls had been made urging the hotel's occupants to leave immediately. For reasons known only to the British the hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded, and to the Irgun's regret and dismay 91 persons were killed.\n\nMcDonald and Jenkins said that no such warning calls were made, adding that even if they had, \"this does not absolve those who planted the bomb from responsibility for the deaths.\"<ref name=LTimes1>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article690085.ece |title=British anger at terror celebration | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Ned | last1=Parker | first2=Stephen | last2=Farrell | date=July 20, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBruce Hoffman states: \"Unlike many terrorist groups today, the Irgun's strategy was not deliberately to target or wantonly harm civilians.\" Max Abrahms writes that the Irgun \"pioneered the practice of issuing pre-attack warnings to spare civilians\", which was later emulated by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and other groups and proved \"effective but not foolproof\". In addition, Begin ordered attacks to take place at night and even during [[Shabbat]] to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties. U.S. military intelligence found that \"the Irgun Zvai Leumi is waging a general war against the government and at all times took special care not to cause damage or injury to persons\". Although the King David Hotel bombing is widely considered a ''prima facie'' case of Irgun terrorism, Abrahms comments: \"But this hotel wasn't a normal hotel.

In December of that same year she released her debut album, ''With Love'', which included the track ''Let's Stay Awhile'', a cover of [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Let's Wait Awhile]]''. However, it was only with her second album, ''Love, Pain, I'm Still Waiting'' (\u611b\u904e\u75db\u904e\u4ea6\u9858\u7b49) that she began to garner some success, when the title song was recognised in the Billboard Awards.\n\nHer third album, ''Like First Love'' (\u5f77\u5f7f\u662f\u521d\u6200) was released in 1992. The title song was a cover of [[Paula Abdul]]'s hugely successful hit, ''[[Rush Rush]]''. In 1993 she released her fourth album, ''SEE FOR CASS'', her last album with Rock Records, which featured her talent for [[a cappella]]. During these early years she became known for her sweet voice and wide vocal range.\n\nIn 1993, Phang signed to [[EMI]], releasing her fifth album, ''So Beautiful...To Be With You'' (\u6709\u8457\u4f60\u2026\u591a\u9ebc\u7f8e), which included her first foray into more dance orientated tracks.\n\nIn 1994, she released her first compilation ''Unfinished Novel'' (\u672a\u5b8c\u7684\u5c0f\u8aaa), which included the new single, ''Let Me Go With You'' (\u8b93\u6211\u8ddf\u4f60\u8d70), on which [[Eric Moo]] laid down vocals for. This proved to be a huge success, and her breakthrough album. Later the same year she released her first [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] language album, ''My Eyes...My Tears'' (\u6211\u7684\u773c\uff0e\u6211\u7684\u6dda), intended for the Taiwanese market.\n\nThe year 1995 proved to be a pivotal one in her career, with the release of several popular albums, ''Awakening From A Dream'' (\u5982\u5922\u521d\u9192), ''Fly With Love'' (\u96a8\u611b\u800c\u98db) and ''Outside the Window'' (\u7a97\u5916). The latter album contained her greatest hit to date, ''All Because of You'' (\u5b8c\u5168\u56e0\u4f60), which was used as the theme song for the movie, ''The [[Peace Hotel]]''. During the same year she won several important awards, including the Commercial Radio Ultimate Song Billboard Award Presentation Ceremony's \"Best Female Singer\"; the RTHK Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Award Presentation Ceremony's \"Ten Most Outstanding Pop Singers\" and \"Best Selling Female Artist\"; Metro Radio Singer Award's \"Best Female Singer Gold Award\"; and the TVB Jade Solid Gold Award Presentation Ceremony's \"Most Popular Female Singer\".\n\nIn 1996, this saw the launch of her second Mandarin language album, ''Trapped Bird'' (\u56da\u9ce5), and the [[Cantonese]] album, ''Water'' (\u6e05\u6c34), which commemorated the [[1996 Pat Sin Leng wildfire]]. She also recorded ''To Embrace Your Days'' (\u62b1\u8457\u4f60\u7684\u65e5\u5b50), and performed her first solo concert at the [[Hong Kong Coliseum]].\n\nIn 1997, this saw the release of ''Wet Eyes'' (\u773c\u775b\u6fd5\u6fd5\u7684) and ''I Have My World'' (\u6211\u6709\u6211\u5929\u5730). In 1998, two more albums were released -''One Thousand and One Nights'' (\u4e00\u5343\u96f6\u4e00\u665a) and ''True Voice''. In September 1998, Cass married fellow DJ singer, [[Jan Lamb]].\n\nIn 1999, Phang signed to [[Sony Music]] (now known as [[Sony BMG]]), and quickly followed with her next album ''A Flower'' (\u4e00\u679d\u82b1). This marked a turn in her music, from soft ballads to light-hearted, up-beat melodies. The song ''To The Boys I've Loved'' (\u7d66\u6211\u611b\u904e\u7684\u7537\u5b69\u5011) came 6th in the Billboard Awards' Ten Best Songs category. In October, she recorded her next Mandarin album, ''Passionate Love'' (\u597d\u597d\u611b), on which she sang a popular duet with [[Wang Lee-hom]]. During this year she also announced that she was pregnant with her first child.\n\nOn 14 February 2000, her daughter, Jae Wing Lam (\u6797\u6cf3) was born. During this time she released her next album, ''As Beautiful As You Want'' (\u8981\u591a\u7f8e\u9e97\u6709\u591a\u7f8e\u9e97), where she collaborated with [[Anthony Wong (singer)|Anthony Wong]] on the song ''Whirlpool''.\n\nIn 2001, she became the spokesperson for the [[Marie France Bodyline]], which she shot two advertisements for. Several songs from her following albums, ''For Lisa'' (\u7d66Lisa) and ''My...'' (\u6211\u7684...) were used as theme songs for adverts and movies.\n\nIn January 2002, she held her \"Cass in the City\" concert, and released a tribute album ''For the Boys'' (\u7d66\u6211\u5531\u904e\u7684\u7537\u5b69\u5011). The tracks from this record were exclusively covers of hits by male RTHK singers.\n\nA dynamic shift in her career took place when Cass was cast in the role of [[Teresa Teng]], in a musical celebrating the life of the late singing legend. The role was hotly contested, with [[Sammi Cheng]] and [[Faye Wong]] both interested in the part.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ent.enorth.com.cn/system/2002/03/27/000300002.shtml |script-title=zh:\u5f6d\u7f9a\u6253\u8d25\u738b\u83f2\u90d1\u79c0\u6587\u51fa\u6f14<\u9093\u4e3d\u541b |date= |publisher=ENORTH NETNEWS Co.,LTD |language=zh |accessdate=12 July 2012 |quote= }}</ref> The musical opened to success on 26 July 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/2/7/26/n204447.htm |script-title=zh:\u5f6d\u7f9a\u6234600\u4e07\u947d\u98fe\u6f14\u97f3\u6a02\u5287\"\u9127\u9e97\u541b\" |date= |publisher=Epoch USA Inc. |language=zh |accessdate=12 July 2012 |quote= }}</ref>\n\nIn September, Cass released what was to be her last album ''Precious Moments'', which included four new songs and a best of selection.

On 28 July 2004, she gave birth to the couple's second daughter, Ching Lamb \u2013 since then she has made few public appearances. In Jan Lamb's comedy shows, Jan has joked that Cass is busy bringing up the kids, or alternatively that she is the 'manager' of him and their children.

She was born in Hong Kong, studied at [[Munsang College]] and a high school in Australia. In September 1998, she married Hong Kong actor and pop singer [[Jan Lamb]], a member of musical rap duo DJ [[Softhard]]. She gave birth to two daughters in February 14, 2000 and July 28, 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phangling.com/e-prof-pinfo.html |title=Cass Profile: Personal Information |date= |publisher=PhangLing.com |accessdate=12 July 2012 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nPhang was first spotted as a backing singer for [[Louis Yuen]], and signed to [[Rock Records]] in 1990. In December of that same year she released her debut album, ''With Love'', which included the track ''Let's Stay Awhile'', a cover of [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Let's Wait Awhile]]''. However, it was only with her second album, ''Love, Pain, I'm Still Waiting'' (\u611b\u904e\u75db\u904e\u4ea6\u9858\u7b49) that she began to garner some success, when the title song was recognised in the Billboard Awards.\n\nHer third album, ''Like First Love'' (\u5f77\u5f7f\u662f\u521d\u6200) was released in 1992. The title song was a cover of [[Paula Abdul]]'s hugely successful hit, ''[[Rush Rush]]''. In 1993 she released her fourth album, ''SEE FOR CASS'', her last album with Rock Records, which featured her talent for [[a cappella]]. During these early years she became known for her sweet voice and wide vocal range.\n\nIn 1993, Phang signed to [[EMI]], releasing her fifth album, ''So Beautiful...To Be With You'' (\u6709\u8457\u4f60\u2026\u591a\u9ebc\u7f8e), which included her first foray into more dance orientated tracks.\n\nIn 1994, she released her first compilation ''Unfinished Novel'' (\u672a\u5b8c\u7684\u5c0f\u8aaa), which included the new single, ''Let Me Go With You'' (\u8b93\u6211\u8ddf\u4f60\u8d70), on which [[Eric Moo]] laid down vocals for. This proved to be a huge success, and her breakthrough album. Later the same year she released her first [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] language album, ''My Eyes...My Tears'' (\u6211\u7684\u773c\uff0e\u6211\u7684\u6dda), intended for the Taiwanese market.\n\nThe year 1995 proved to be a pivotal one in her career, with the release of several popular albums, ''Awakening From A Dream'' (\u5982\u5922\u521d\u9192), ''Fly With Love'' (\u96a8\u611b\u800c\u98db) and ''Outside the Window'' (\u7a97\u5916).
