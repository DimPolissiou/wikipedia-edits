The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations.The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to developing it out to following a concept. According Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d <ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=[[Coming Soon]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc. <ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the livestream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Mike L.

In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations.The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to developing it out to following a concept. According Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d <ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=[[Coming Soon]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc. <ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series [[\u00c6on Flux]] and [[Liquid Television]] and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the livestream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Marxblom", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\nIn 2008, [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets :\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, government policies that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the increasing famine.  The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in many ways, including the illusion of superabundance.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn 1960, at least some degree of drought and other bad weather affected 55% of cultivated land, while an estimated 60% of agricultural land in northern China received no rain at all.<ref name=\"Atimes\">{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Henry C K|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|title=Part 2: The Great Leap Forward not all bad|date=1 April 2004|work=[[Asia Times]] online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204085928/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|archive-date=4 February 2005}}</ref> The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] yearbooks from 1958 to 1962 also reported abnormal weather, followed by droughts and floods based on Chinese government sources.

In July 1959, the [[Yellow River]] flooded in [[East China]]. According to the Disaster Center, the flood directly killed, either through starvation from crop failure or drowning, an estimated 2 million people, while other areas were affected in other ways as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|title=The Most Deadly 100 Natural Disasters of the 20th Century|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110082733/http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|access-date=4 July 2005}}</ref> [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]] argues that most floods were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of the [[Great Leap Forward]].<ref name=\"Dikotter333\" /> At this time, China was building thousands of kilometers of new irrigation canals in an attempt to move water from wet areas to areas that were experiencing drought.\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the production of grains throughout China was actually decreasing from 1957\u20131961.

On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue it to being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared show that, much like [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, government policies that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the increasing famine.  The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in many ways, including the illusion of superabundance.

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn 1960, at least some degree of drought and other bad weather affected 55% of cultivated land, while an estimated 60% of agricultural land in northern China received no rain at all.<ref name=\"Atimes\">{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Henry C K|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|title=Part 2: The Great Leap Forward not all bad|date=1 April 2004|work=[[Asia Times]] online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204085928/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|archive-date=4 February 2005}}</ref> The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] yearbooks from 1958 to 1962 also reported abnormal weather, followed by droughts and floods based on Chinese government sources.

In July 1959, the [[Yellow River]] flooded in [[East China]]. According to the Disaster Center, the flood directly killed, either through starvation from crop failure or drowning, an estimated 2 million people, while other areas were affected in other ways as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|title=The Most Deadly 100 Natural Disasters of the 20th Century|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110082733/http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|access-date=4 July 2005}}</ref> [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]] argues that most floods were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of the [[Great Leap Forward]].<ref name=\"Dikotter333\" /> At this time, China was building thousands of kilometers of new irrigation canals in an attempt to move water from wet areas to areas that were experiencing drought.\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], [[AllieStein]], and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots, and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round robin, Ethereal, Fire and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S15 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S15 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. In the end, Lc0 won the premier division for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], while Stockfish failed to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stoofvlees drew with Stockfish in the final game, then it would find itself in a three-way tie with Stoofvlees and Fire, and relegated because it had the worst head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

After a closely contested opening 33 games, Stockfish held a 1 point advantage, but Leela Chess Zero reeled off three wins in the following five games to take control of the superfinal. After both scoring wins as white in the Scandinavian opening in games 43 and 44 respectively, there then followed an extremely tense run of 21 successive draws, with the occasional game being characterised with Leela Chess Zero outplaying Stockfish with the white pieces in the middlegame but being unable to break through Stockfish's extremely accurate defensive play. Leela Chess Zero then scored a crucial victory in game 66 to extend her lead to 3 points, but Stockfish fought back to narrow the gap to 2 points going into the final 12 games. However, Leela Chess Zero finished with a remarkable six wins in the final ten games of the superfinal, and could have won a seventh game were it not for Stockfish finding a brilliant defensive resource in game 100 that Leela did not spot, and was thus able to force a drawn endgame. Leela Chess Zero confirmed herself as Champion with wins in games 95 and 96, marking the superfinal's only occurrence of one engine winning the same predetermined opening line as both black and white. Grandmaster [[Mykhaylo Oleksiyenko]] described these two victories as 'masterpieces'.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6bOnCFc9KI&t=2961s</ref><ref>Games are archived at https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=sf&game=1</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Computer chess competitions]]\n[[Category:2020 in chess]]\n[[Category:Top Chess Engine Championship]]\n", "text_old": "{| class=\"infobox\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:30%;  border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\"\n |-\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:115%\"|'''Winner'''\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:115%\"|'''Runner-up'''\n |-\n | width=33% | [[File:Leela Chess Zero logo.svg|center|Leela Chess Zero|140px]]\n | width=33% | \n |-\n | style=\"text-align:center\"|'''[[Leela Chess Zero]]'''\n | style=\"text-align:center\"|'''[[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]]'''\n |-\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:200%\"|'''52.5 (17)'''\n | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:200%\"|'''47.5 (12)'''\n |-\n |style=\"text-align:left\"| \u2190 [[TCEC Season 16]]\n |style=\"text-align:right\"| [[TCEC Season 18]] \u2192\n|}\n\nThe 17th season of the [[Top Chess Engine Championship]] began on 2 January 2020. The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], [[AllieStein]], and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots, and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round robin, Ethereal, Fire and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S15 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S15 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. In the end, Lc0 won the premier division for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], while Stockfish failed to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stoofvlees drew with Stockfish in the final game, then it would find itself in a three-way tie with Stoofvlees and Fire, and relegated because it had the worst head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

After a closely contested opening 33 games, Stockfish held a 1 point advantage, but Leela Chess Zero reeled off three wins in the following five games to take control of the superfinal. After both scoring wins as white in the Scandinavian opening in games 43 and 44 respectively, there then followed an extremely tense run of 21 successive draws, with the occasional game being characterised with Leela Chess Zero outplaying Stockfish with the white pieces in the middlegame but being unable to break through Stockfish's extremely accurate defensive play. Leela Chess Zero then scored a crucial victory in game 66 to extend her lead to 3 points, but Stockfish fought back to narrow the gap to 2 points going into the final 12 games. However, Leela Chess Zero finished with a remarkable six wins in the final ten games of the superfinal, and could have won a seventh game were it not for Stockfish finding a brilliant defensive resource in game 100 that Leela did not spot, and was thus able to force a drawn endgame. Leela Chess Zero confirmed herself as Champion with wins in games 95 and 96, marking the superfinal's only occurrence of one engine winning the same predetermined opening line as both black and white. Grandmaster [[Mykhaylo Oleksiyenko]] described these two victories as 'masterpieces'.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6bOnCFc9KI&t=2961s</ref> <ref>Games are archived at https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=sf&game=1</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Computer chess competitions]]\n[[Category:2020 in chess]]\n[[Category:Top Chess Engine Championship]]\n", "name_user": "Kaldari", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSuperfinal:removing extra space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCEC_Season_17"}

After returning to [[California Institute of Technology]] for a short while, Shockley moved to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]], in 1956, and founded [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]]. Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.  Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire.\"\n\nAccording to Arbuckle (p.&nbsp;380\u2013381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E. Allen and C. Burnham led the way to \"build a line from San Francisco to Marysville via San Jose, Stockton, and Sacramento\".  Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, \"\u2026San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.  The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24.\"\n\nThe Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology.

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs.

Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of [[venture capital]] on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3&nbsp;billion [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.<ref name=\"WRichardScott\" />\n\nIn 1971 [[Don Hoefler]] traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]]'s eight co-founders.<ref name=DH-71 /><ref name=\"NetValley\">[http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the \"Golden\" Startups of Silicon Valley] by Gregory Gromov</ref> The key investors in [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] were from the same group, directly leading to ''[[Tech Crunch]]'' 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 Trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.<ref name=Morris-2014>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/ |title=The First Trillion-Dollar Startup | work=[[Tech Crunch]] |first=Rhett |last=Morris |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref>\n{{Wide image|Silicon Vally Venture Capital investment.png|800px|align-cap=center|Silicon Valley [[venture capital]] investment, 2002-2017.|100%|center}}\n\n===Law firms===\nPrior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced [[patent attorney]]s whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property.  During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley.

Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.\n\nUsing money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].\n\nWhile Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.<ref>[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com</ref> Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over [[Stanford University]]'s [[Ethernet]] [[campus network]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John K. |last = Waters |date= 2002 |title= John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility  |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=  9780471273554| page = 28}}</ref>\n\n===Internet age===\n{{main|Internet}}\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.<ref name=N1995>{{cite book|author1=W.
