A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ... By this act the brain of the Afro-American is indissolubly linked with the Capital and nation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Paper Read Before the Banneker of Association of Washington}} ''In'' {{cite book |title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|last=Allen|first=Will W.|year=1921|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=10344679|lccn=21017456}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first1=Will W.|last1=Allen|first2=Daniel|last2=Murray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C|title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|pages=12\u201315|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005|oclc=808618979|isbn=0933121-48-2|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2017-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215012211/https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1976 (more than 50 years later), Jerome Klinkowitz stated within a book that described the works of Banneker and other early black American writers that Murray's report had initiated a myth about Banneker's career. Klinkowitz noted that Murray had not provided any support for his claim that Banneker had recalled L'Enfant's plan for Washington, D.C.

When describing the ceremonial presentation to [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., of a [[sundial]] memorializing Banneker, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' newspaper reported in that year that a speaker had claimed that:\n\n<blockquote>.... he (Banneker) was appointed by President George Washington to aid Major L'Enfant, famed French architect, to plan the layout of the District of Columbia.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

It enters Iowa from [[Nebraska]], concurrent with [[Interstate 129]] and [[U.S. Route 75 in Iowa|U.S Route 75]], crossing the [[Missouri River]] at [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]].  US&nbsp;20 runs in a more-or-less straight line across Iowa, paralleling 42\u00b0&nbsp;27'&nbsp;N.  It leaves Iowa in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] by crossing the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Illinois]].  Since October 2018, US&nbsp;20 is a four-lane divided highway for its entire length in Iowa.\n\n==Route description==\nUS&nbsp;20 enters Iowa on the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge, which also carries [[Interstate 129|I-129]] and [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]], over the [[Missouri River]].  Almost immediately upon landing in Iowa, there is an interchange with [[Interstate 29 in Iowa|I-29]], at which I-129 ends.  Continuing east, US&nbsp;20 and US&nbsp;75 [[concurrency (road)|run together]] around the southern and eastern sides of Sioux City.  The two routes split at the [[U.S. Route 20 Business (Sioux City, Iowa)|Gordon Drive]] interchange as US&nbsp;20 exits to the east from [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]]. The expressway is an older section that goes through [[Lawton, Iowa|Lawton]] and comes to a stop sign at [[Moville, Iowa|Moville]]. About two miles further east, the newest four-lane stretch (except for a short expressway segment just south of [[Holstein, Iowa|Holstein]] that is briefly concurrent with [[U.S. Route 59 in Iowa|U.S. Route 59]]) <ref name=\"Google Maps\">{{Google maps | url = https://www.google.com/maps/preview?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=IA-20/US-20&daddr=US-20&hl=en&geocode=FX0diAIdaJZO-g%3BFVPEhwIdcGlh-g&gl=us&mra=ls&sll=42.441828,-94.288616&sspn=0.082468,0.136642&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=9 | accessdate = April 17, 2009}}</ref> starts and goes to about one mile west of an interchange with [[U.S. Route 71 in Iowa|U.S. Route 71]] and [[Iowa Highway 471]], just north of [[Early, Iowa|Early]].<ref name=\"WHO-TV\">{{cite web|url=http://whotv.com/2015/11/17/final-piece-of-us-20-four-lane-highway-to-be-finished-by-2018/|title=Final Piece of US 20 Four-Lane Highway To Be Finished by 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref>  From this point until an interchange with [[Iowa Highway 4]] northwest of [[Rockwell City, Iowa|Rockwell City]] is the second newest section of four-lane, which opened in November 2012.<ref name=Dreeszen>{{cite news|last=Dreeszen|first=Dave|title=Local leaders to lobby for Highway 20 funding|url=http://siouxcityjournal.com/business/local/local-leaders-to-lobby-for-highway-funding/article_7cce4bf3-1496-5856-b3fa-bc4937db3391.html|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=[[Sioux City Journal]]|date=January 26, 2014}}</ref>  This new roadway passes to the north of [[Sac City, Iowa|Sac City]] and [[Lytton, Iowa|Lytton]], and has another interchange with the realigned route of [[U.S. Route 71]] northeast of Sac City, but mostly has at-grade intersections, including County M54 into Sac City and N28 into Lytton.\n\nEast of Iowa 4, and extending to the former beginning of the four-lane expressway northeast of [[Moorland, Iowa|Moorland]] (now an interchange with County D36), is a 4-lane section which opened in December 2010, and bypasses Rockwell City to the north.  US 20 continues until just south of Highview, when it becomes a full interstate-standard freeway.  The expressway south of [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]] has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 169 in Iowa|U.S. Route 169]] and Webster County Route P59.  East of Fort Dodge, US 20 overlaps with [[Iowa Highway 17]] for {{convert|4.5|mi}}, ending at [[Webster City, Iowa|Webster City]].  Near [[Williams, Iowa|Williams]], US 20 intersects [[Interstate 35 (Iowa)|Interstate 35]].  Beginning at the interchange with [[U.S. Route 65 in Iowa|U.S. Route 65]] is a section of four-lane freeway which, when completed, shaved nearly {{convert|16|mi}} off of US 20's length.  Prior to 2003, US 20 joined [[U.S. Route 65 in Iowa|U.S. Route 65]] north through [[Iowa Falls, Iowa|Iowa Falls]] and then east towards [[Ackley, Iowa|Ackley]] and [[Parkersburg, Iowa|Parkersburg]] before heading south again to the freeway with [[Iowa Highway 14]].

The western junction of Iowa 58 (Hudson Road) connects traffic to the [[University of Northern Iowa]] while the eastern junction of Iowa 58 is also the western junction of [[Iowa Highway 27]], the [[Avenue of the Saints]].  Another mile east, in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], US 20 intersects [[U.S. Route 63 in Iowa|U.S. Route 63]] (Sergeant Road).  On the southeast side of Waterloo, [[Interstate 380 (Iowa)|Interstate 380]] joins US 20/IA 27 for {{convert|6|mi}} before exiting with Iowa 27 south towards [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]].\n\nU.S. 20 continues as a freeway east of Waterloo.  It intersects [[Iowa Highway 150]] at [[Independence, Iowa|Independence]] and [[Iowa Highway 13]] at [[Manchester, Iowa|Manchester]], as well as junctioning a number of county roads serving smaller communities.  Approximately {{convert|21|mi}} between Independence and Manchester go over a [[terminal moraine]] and enter the [[Driftless Area]], a region it will not exit until reaching [[Stockton, Illinois]].\n\n[[File:Julien Dubuque Bridge US 20.jpg|thumb|U.S. Highway 20 crosses the Mississippi River at Dubuque using the Julien Dubuque Bridge.|alt=An overlook of a city in the foreground and a river running through the middle of the picture. Three bridges cross the river.]]\nAt Delaware, US 20 changes from a freeway to an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] with at-grade intersections; however, there are many interchanges where US 20 meets major roads, mostly at the villages and towns along US 20's route.  US 20 serves [[Earlville, Iowa|Earlville]], [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]] (passing near the [[Field of Dreams (Dubuque County, Iowa)|Field of Dreams]] filming site), [[Farley, Iowa|Farley]], [[Epworth, Iowa|Epworth]], and [[Peosta, Iowa|Peosta]] before entering Dubuque.  US 20 remains at least four lanes through Dubuque, but there are several stoplights along the route, particularly on the western edge of the city.  There is a brief controlled-access section where the highway descends into the [[Mississippi River]] valley.  Near the river, [[Iowa Highway 946|Locust Street]] connects US 20 with [[U.S. Highway 52]], [[U.S. Highway 61]], and [[U.S. Highway 151]], which have entered the city from the south as an expressway and continue northward as a freeway.  US 20 crosses from Iowa into [[Illinois]] via the [[Julien Dubuque Bridge]].\n\n==History==\n{{quote box|width=20em|bgcolor=|align=right|quote=Primitive conditions grew apace as we went west from Cedar Falls. From Alden to Webster City , twenty-five miles, with the exception of a stage station where horses were changed, there was nothing but the virgin prairie. Not a bush nor a running brook broke the monotony. From Webster City to Fort Dodge, twenty miles, there was no house but that of the enterprising muskrat. ... Here was a route from Cedar Falls to Sioux City, two hundred miles long in a straight line, that typified the highest stage of development west of the railroads. Yet it was wilder than I know how to tell, and north of these wild conditions were wilder still, and wilder grew the farther we went. |source= Anson Bicknell in 1862<ref>{{cite news |title=Pioneer Days in Northwestern Iowa |last=Bicknell |first= Anson D. |work= [[Humboldt Republican]] |location= Humboldt, Iowa |oclc=12332764  |date=April 15 \u2013 June 24, 1897 |via= ''The History of the City of Humboldt'' by Oliver H. DeGroote }}</ref> }}\n\nU.S. Highway 20 was designated in Iowa on October 16, 1926.  The designation created a single route number for drivers to follow across the state from Sioux City to Dubuque; previously, three route numbers were used.\n\nIt is possible to drive most of US 20's former two-lane alignment from Early to Dubuque.  Most of this routing (with the exception of [[Iowa Highway 57]] from US 65 to Cedar Falls) is now under city and county control, but most of the guide signs remain from when US 20 followed this route.  From Moorland, the highway's former alignment is U.S. Highway 20 Business through Fort Dodge. At Webster County Route P59, it continues on Webster County Route D20.  The road changes designations several times between this point and Iowa Falls, but its route is very clear.  It follows US 65 north out of Iowa Falls to the junction of Iowa 57, then follows 57 to Cedar Falls.  At Cedar Falls, the former alignment continues on US 218 to Broadway Street; through Waterloo, it follows Broadway to Franklin Street to Dubuque Road.  Beyond Waterloo, the designation of the road again changes several times, but the route to follow remains clear. Between Dyersville and Farley, US 20 follows its historic alignment. At Farley, the former alignment follows Old Highway Road into Dubuque.\n\n===Expansion project===\nThe first segment of US 20 in Iowa to become four lanes was a short expressway segment east of Moville, which opened in 1958. Another short expressway segment in the Dubuque area opened in 1959. The rest of the expressway from Sioux City to Moville opened in 1964.  By 1979 the Sioux City bypass was complete, as well as the section from Iowa 17 to Interstate 35, and the section from Independence to Delaware. By the end of the 1980s, the four-lane portions of US 20 ran from Coalville (near Fort Dodge) to Interstate 35 and from Waterloo to Dubuque.\n\nDuring the 1990s little work was done to the route.  It was extended westward to US 169 in 1991, and eastward to US 65 the same year, though initially the section from I-35 to US 65 was only two lanes.  The new, semi-controlled section in Dubuque opened in 1996.  Work began to accelerate in 2000, with the section between Interstate 35 and U.S. Highway 65 becoming four lanes that year.  The segment from Iowa 14 to Cedar Falls also opened in 2000.  By 2003, the highway was complete from Fort Dodge to Dubuque.\n\nPaving work between Iowa Highway 4 and Moorland was completed in 2010 and the stretch was opened in December 2010. In November 2012, the 4-lane highway opened between Iowa 4 near Rockwell City and US 71 at Early, Iowa.<ref>[http://siouxcityjournal.com/business/local/local-leaders-to-lobby-for-highway-funding/article_7cce4bf3-1496-5856-b3fa-bc4937db3391.html Local leaders to lobby for Highway 20 funding].

It enters Iowa from [[Nebraska]], concurrent with [[Interstate 129]] and [[U.S. Route 75 in Iowa|U.S Route 75]], crossing the [[Missouri River]] at [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]].  US&nbsp;20 runs in a more-or-less straight line across Iowa, paralleling 42\u00b0&nbsp;27'&nbsp;N.  It leaves Iowa in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] by crossing the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Illinois]].  Since October 2018, US&nbsp;20 is a four-lane divided highway for its entire length in Iowa.\n\n==Route description==\nUS&nbsp;20 enters Iowa on the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge, which also carries [[Interstate 129|I-129]] and [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]], over the [[Missouri River]].  Almost immediately upon landing in Iowa, there is an interchange with [[Interstate 29 in Iowa|I-29]], at which I-129 ends.  Continuing east, US&nbsp;20 and US&nbsp;75 [[concurrency (road)|run together]] around the southern and eastern sides of Sioux City.  The two routes split at the [[U.S. Route 20 Business (Sioux City, Iowa)|Gordon Drive]] interchange as US&nbsp;20 exits to the east from [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]]. The expressway is an older section that goes through [[Lawton, Iowa|Lawton]] and comes to a stop sign at [[Moville, Iowa|Moville]]. About two miles further east, the newest four-lane stretch (except for a short expressway segment just south of [[Holstein, Iowa|Holstein]] that is briefly concurrent with [[U.S. Route 59 in Iowa|U.S. Route 59]]) <ref name=\"Google Maps\">{{Google maps | url = https://www.google.com/maps/preview?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=IA-20/US-20&daddr=US-20&hl=en&geocode=FX0diAIdaJZO-g%3BFVPEhwIdcGlh-g&gl=us&mra=ls&sll=42.441828,-94.288616&sspn=0.082468,0.136642&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=9 | accessdate = April 17, 2009}}</ref> starts and goes to about one mile west of an interchange with [[U.S. Route 71 in Iowa|U.S. Route 71]] and [[Iowa Highway 471]], just north of [[Early, Iowa|Early]].<ref name=\"WHO-TV\">{{cite web|url=http://whotv.com/2015/11/17/final-piece-of-us-20-four-lane-highway-to-be-finished-by-2018/|title=Final Piece of US 20 Four-Lane Highway To Be Finished by 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref>  From this point until an interchange with [[Iowa Highway 4]] northwest of [[Rockwell City, Iowa|Rockwell City]] is the second newest section of four-lane, which opened in November 2012.<ref name=Dreeszen>{{cite news|last=Dreeszen|first=Dave|title=Local leaders to lobby for Highway 20 funding|url=http://siouxcityjournal.com/business/local/local-leaders-to-lobby-for-highway-funding/article_7cce4bf3-1496-5856-b3fa-bc4937db3391.html|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=[[Sioux City Journal]]|date=January 26, 2014}}</ref>  This new roadway passes to the north of [[Sac City, Iowa|Sac City]] and [[Lytton, Iowa|Lytton]], and has another interchange with the realigned route of [[U.S. Route 71]] northeast of Sac City, but mostly has at-grade intersections, including County M54 into Sac City and N28 into Lytton.\n\nEast of Iowa 4, and extending to the former beginning of the four-lane expressway northeast of [[Moorland, Iowa|Moorland]] (now an interchange with County D36), is a 4-lane section which opened in December 2010, and bypasses Rockwell City to the north.  US 20 continues until just south of Highview, when it becomes a full interstate-standard freeway.  The expressway south of [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]] has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 169 in Iowa|U.S. Route 169]] and Webster County Route P59.  East of Fort Dodge, US 20 overlaps with [[Iowa Highway 17]] for {{convert|4.5|mi}}, ending at [[Webster City, Iowa|Webster City]].  Near [[Williams, Iowa|Williams]], US 20 intersects [[Interstate 35 (Iowa)|Interstate 35]].  Beginning at the interchange with [[U.S. Route 65 in Iowa|U.S. Route 65]] is a section of four-lane freeway which, when completed, shaved nearly {{convert|16|mi}} off of US 20's length.  Prior to 2003, US 20 joined [[U.S. Route 65 in Iowa|U.S. Route 65]] north through [[Iowa Falls, Iowa|Iowa Falls]] and then east towards [[Ackley, Iowa|Ackley]] and [[Parkersburg, Iowa|Parkersburg]] before heading south again to the freeway with [[Iowa Highway 14]].  The bridge crossing the [[Iowa River]] near [[Steamboat Rock, Iowa|Steamboat Rock]] is a ''launched steel I-girder'' bridge, the first of its kind in the United States.<ref name=\"DOT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iowadot.gov/iowariverbridge/index.html |title=The US 20 Iowa River Bridge&nbsp;\u2014 A Launched Steel I-Girder Bridge |last=Iowa Department of Transportation |year=2003 |accessdate=October 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523180318/http://www.iowadot.gov/iowariverbridge/index.html |archivedate=May 23, 2009 }}</ref>  The bridge was designed to cross the old-growth woodland of the Iowa River valley with minimal impact.\n\nU.S. Highway 20 continues east towards [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]] where it overlaps [[Iowa Highway 58]] for just over {{convert|1|mi}}.  The western junction of Iowa 58 (Hudson Road) connects traffic to the [[University of Northern Iowa]] while the eastern junction of Iowa 58 is also the western junction of [[Iowa Highway 27]], the [[Avenue of the Saints]].  Another mile east, in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], US 20 intersects [[U.S. Route 63 in Iowa|U.S. Route 63]] (Sergeant Road).  On the southeast side of Waterloo, [[Interstate 380 (Iowa)|Interstate 380]] joins US 20/IA 27 for {{convert|6|mi}} before exiting with Iowa 27 south towards [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]].\n\nU.S. 20 continues as a freeway east of Waterloo.  It intersects [[Iowa Highway 150]] at [[Independence, Iowa|Independence]] and [[Iowa Highway 13]] at [[Manchester, Iowa|Manchester]], as well as junctioning a number of county roads serving smaller communities.  Approximately {{convert|21|mi}} between Independence and Manchester go over a [[terminal moraine]] and enter the [[Driftless Area]], a region it will not exit until reaching [[Stockton, Illinois]].\n\n[[File:Julien Dubuque Bridge US 20.jpg|thumb|U.S. Highway 20 crosses the Mississippi River at Dubuque using the Julien Dubuque Bridge.|alt=An overlook of a city in the foreground and a river running through the middle of the picture. Three bridges cross the river.]]\nAt Delaware, US 20 changes from a freeway to an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] with at-grade intersections; however, there are many interchanges where US 20 meets major roads, mostly at the villages and towns along US 20's route.  US 20 serves [[Earlville, Iowa|Earlville]], [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]] (passing near the [[Field of Dreams (Dubuque County, Iowa)|Field of Dreams]] filming site), [[Farley, Iowa|Farley]], [[Epworth, Iowa|Epworth]], and [[Peosta, Iowa|Peosta]] before entering Dubuque.  US 20 remains at least four lanes through Dubuque, but there are several stoplights along the route, particularly on the western edge of the city.  There is a brief controlled-access section where the highway descends into the [[Mississippi River]] valley.  Near the river, [[Iowa Highway 946|Locust Street]] connects US 20 with [[U.S. Highway 52]], [[U.S. Highway 61]], and [[U.S. Highway 151]], which have entered the city from the south as an expressway and continue northward as a freeway.  US 20 crosses from Iowa into [[Illinois]] via the [[Julien Dubuque Bridge]].\n\n==History==\n{{quote box|width=20em|bgcolor=|align=right|quote=Primitive conditions grew apace as we went west from Cedar Falls. From Alden to Webster City , twenty-five miles, with the exception of a stage station where horses were changed, there was nothing but the virgin prairie. Not a bush nor a running brook broke the monotony. From Webster City to Fort Dodge, twenty miles, there was no house but that of the enterprising muskrat. ... Here was a route from Cedar Falls to Sioux City, two hundred miles long in a straight line, that typified the highest stage of development west of the railroads. Yet it was wilder than I know how to tell, and north of these wild conditions were wilder still, and wilder grew the farther we went. |source= Anson Bicknell in 1862<ref>{{cite news |title=Pioneer Days in Northwestern Iowa |last=Bicknell |first= Anson D. |work= [[Humboldt Republican]] |location= Humboldt, Iowa |oclc=12332764  |date=April 15 \u2013 June 24, 1897 |via= ''The History of the City of Humboldt'' by Oliver H.

The designation created a single route number for drivers to follow across the state from Sioux City to Dubuque; previously, three route numbers were used.\n\nIt is possible to drive most of US 20's former two-lane alignment from Early to Dubuque.  Most of this routing (with the exception of [[Iowa Highway 57]] from US 65 to Cedar Falls) is now under city and county control, but most of the guide signs remain from when US 20 followed this route.  From Moorland, the highway's former alignment is U.S. Highway 20 Business through Fort Dodge. At Webster County Route P59, it continues on Webster County Route D20.  The road changes designations several times between this point and Iowa Falls, but its route is very clear.  It follows US 65 north out of Iowa Falls to the junction of Iowa 57, then follows 57 to Cedar Falls.  At Cedar Falls, the former alignment continues on US 218 to Broadway Street; through Waterloo, it follows Broadway to Franklin Street to Dubuque Road.  Beyond Waterloo, the designation of the road again changes several times, but the route to follow remains clear. Between Dyersville and Farley, US 20 follows its historic alignment. At Farley, the former alignment follows Old Highway Road into Dubuque.\n\n===Expansion project===\nThe first segment of US 20 in Iowa to become four lanes was a short expressway segment east of Moville, which opened in 1958. Another short expressway segment in the Dubuque area opened in 1959. The rest of the expressway from Sioux City to Moville opened in 1964.  By 1979 the Sioux City bypass was complete, as well as the section from Iowa 17 to Interstate 35, and the section from Independence to Delaware. By the end of the 1980s, the four-lane portions of US 20 ran from Coalville (near Fort Dodge) to Interstate 35 and from Waterloo to Dubuque.\n\nDuring the 1990s little work was done to the route.  It was extended westward to US 169 in 1991, and eastward to US 65 the same year, though initially the section from I-35 to US 65 was only two lanes.  The new, semi-controlled section in Dubuque opened in 1996.  Work began to accelerate in 2000, with the section between Interstate 35 and U.S. Highway 65 becoming four lanes that year.  The segment from Iowa 14 to Cedar Falls also opened in 2000.  By 2003, the highway was complete from Fort Dodge to Dubuque.\n\nPaving work between Iowa Highway 4 and Moorland was completed in 2010 and the stretch was opened in December 2010. In November 2012, the 4-lane highway opened between Iowa 4 near Rockwell City and US 71 at Early, Iowa.<ref>[http://siouxcityjournal.com/business/local/local-leaders-to-lobby-for-highway-funding/article_7cce4bf3-1496-5856-b3fa-bc4937db3391.html Local leaders to lobby for Highway 20 funding].

Local leaders were lobbying for the remaining estimated cost of $375 million to complete the project.<ref name=Dreeszen />\n\nIn November 2015, it was announced that the final forty miles of US 20 between [[Early, Iowa|Early]] and [[Moville, Iowa|Moville]] will be upgraded to four lanes at an estimated cost of $240 million.  The funding came from the state's gas tax increase.

Climate change acts predominantly by exacerbating the existing, often enormous, health problems, especially in the poorer parts of the world. Current variations in weather conditions already have many adverse impacts on the health of poor people in developing nations,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin|title=Bulletin|date=21 September 2015|website=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> and these too are likely to be 'multiplied' by the added stresses of climate change.\n\nA changing climate thus affects the prerequisites of population health: clean air and water, sufficient food, natural constraints on infectious disease agents, and the adequacy and security of shelter. A warmer and more variable climate leads to higher levels of some [[air pollutant]]s. It increases the rates and ranges of transmission of infectious diseases through unclean water and contaminated food, and by affecting [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] organisms (such as [[mosquitoes]]) and intermediate or reservoir host species that harbour the infectious agent (such as cattle,<ref name=\"LundeLindtjorn 2013CattleClimate\">{{cite journal |author1=Lunde, T.M.  |author2=Lindtj\u00f8rn, B. | year=2013 | title= Cattle and climate in Africa: How climate variability has influenced national cattle holdings from 1961\u20132008 | journal=[[PeerJ (journal)|PeerJ]] | doi=10.7717/peerj.55 |pmid=23638393  |pmc=3629083  | volume = 1 | pages = e55 | issue=1}}</ref> [[bat]]s and [[rodents]]). Changes in temperature, rainfall and seasonality compromise agricultural production in many regions, including some of the least developed countries, thus jeopardising child health and growth and the overall health and functional capacity of adults.

[[Dengue fever]] is spread by the bite of the female mosquito known as ''[[Aedes aegypti]].'' This species of mosquito can travel up to 400 meters in search of water to lay their eggs, but often remain closer to human habitation. A [[mosquito]] becomes infected with dengue when it bites and takes the blood of an infected human. After approximately one week, the mosquito can then transmit the dengue infection to other humans through her bite. While dengue cannot be spread from person to person, an infected person can infect more mosquitos, thus, furthering the spread of the disease. Overall, the female mosquito is a highly effective vector of this disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/faq/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Dengue/Severe dengue frequently asked questions|website=WHO|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen bitten by an infected mosquito, dengue has an [[incubation period]] of 4\u201310 days. Once infected with the dengue virus, humans experience severe flu-like symptoms. Also known as \"break-bone fever\", dengue can affect infants, children, and adults and can be fatal. Those infected exhibit a [[high fever]] (40&nbsp;\u00b0C/ 104&nbsp;\u00b0F) along with at least two of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eye, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, muscle and joint pains, and rash. These symptoms usually last 2\u20137 days. Dengue can become fatal due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. Warning signs of this include a decrease in temperature decrease (below 38&nbsp;\u00b0C/ 100&nbsp;\u00b0F) in conjunction with: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, blood in vomit, and/or fatigue and restlessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/human/en/|title=WHO {{!}} The human|website=WHO|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nWhere the mosquito, ''Aedes aegypti'', lives and the amount of mosquitos present is strongly influenced by the amount of water-bearing containers or pockets of standstill water in an area, daily temperature and variation in temperature, moisture, and solar radiation.<ref>Patz, J.

Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters.\n\nIn a journal paper, Nicholls and [[Richard Tol|Tol]] (2006) considered the effects of sea level rise:<ref>{{cite journal\n|year=2006|title=Impacts and responses to sea-level rise: a global analysis of the SRES scenarios over the twenty-first century\n|author1=Nicholls, R.J.  |author2=R.S.J.

Small islands and deltaic settings stand out as being more vulnerable as shown in many earlier analyses. Collectively, these results suggest that human societies will have more choice in how they respond to sea-level rise than is often assumed. However, this conclusion needs to be tempered by recognition that we still do not understand these choices and significant impacts remain possible.</blockquote>\n\nThe IPCC reported that socioeconomic impacts of climate change in coastal and low-lying areas would be overwhelmingly adverse.

Minimising these risks by building in less disaster prone areas, can be expensive and impossible in countries with coastal locations or [[island state]]s. All [[thermal power station]]s depend on water to cool them.  Not only is there increased demand for fresh water, but climate change can increase the likelihood of [[drought]] and [[Water shortage|fresh water shortages]]. Another impact for thermal power plants, is that increasing the temperatures in which they operate reduces their efficiency and hence their output. The source of oil often comes from areas prone to high natural disaster risks; such as tropical storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and floods. An example is [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s impact on oil extraction in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], as it destroyed 126 oil and gas platforms and damaged 183 more.<ref name=ODI1>Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011.

However, the impact of water shortages on nuclear power plants cooled by rivers will be greater than on other thermal power plants.  This is because old reactor designs with water-cooled cores must run at lower internal temperatures and thus, paradoxically, must dump more heat to the environment to produce a given amount of electricity. This situation has forced some nuclear reactors to be shut down and will do so again unless the cooling systems of these plants are enhanced to provide more capacity.  Nuclear power supply was diminished by low river flow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling. Such shutdowns happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves.  During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power; and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage, and forced the French government to import electricity. Other cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007. In particular: \n* The [[Unterweser Nuclear Power Plant|Unterweser nuclear power plant]] reduced output by 90% between June and September 2003.\n* The [[Isar Nuclear Power Plant|Isar nuclear power plant]] cut production by 60% for 14 days due to excess river temperatures and low stream flow in the river Isar in 2006.\nSimilar events have happened elsewhere in Europe during those same hot summers. Many scientists agree that if [[global warming]] continues, this disruption is likely to increase.<ref name=ODI1/>\n\n=== Hydroelectricity ===\nChanges in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows because of drought, climate change, or upstream dams and diversions, will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir; therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be a power shortage in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]]. Studies from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggests that modest climate changes (such as a 2 degree change in Celsius that could result in a 10% decline in precipitation), might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. [[Brazil]] in particular, is vulnerable due to its having reliance on hydroelectricity as increasing temperatures, lower water flow, and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.<ref name=ODI1 />\n\n\n\n===Insurance===\nAn industry directly affected by the risks of climate change is the [[insurance]] industry.<ref>[http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf Viewpoint] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301073456/http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf |date=1 March 2012 }} American Association of Insurance Services</ref> According to a 2005 report from the Association of British Insurers, limiting carbon emissions could avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s.<ref>Association of British Insurers (2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf \"Financial Risks of Climate Change\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605171753/https://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf |date=5 June 2013 }} summary report</ref> A June 2004 report by the Association of British Insurers declared \"Climate change is not a remote issue for future generations to deal with; it is, in various forms here already, impacting on insurers' businesses now.\"<ref>Association of British Insurers (June 2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf \"A Changing Climate for Insurance:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104126/http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }} A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers\"</ref> The report noted that weather-related risks for households and property were already increasing by 2\u20134% per year due to the changing weather conditions, and claims for storm and flood damages in the UK had doubled to over \u00a36 billion over the period from 1998\u20132003 compared to the previous five years.

Climate change acts predominantly by exacerbating the existing, often enormous, health problems, especially in the poorer parts of the world. Current variations in weather conditions already have many adverse impacts on the health of poor people in developing nations,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin|title=Bulletin|date=21 September 2015|website=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> and these too are likely to be 'multiplied' by the added stresses of climate change.\n\nA changing climate thus affects the prerequisites of population health: clean air and water, sufficient food, natural constraints on infectious disease agents, and the adequacy and security of shelter. A warmer and more variable climate leads to higher levels of some [[air pollutant]]s. It increases the rates and ranges of transmission of infectious diseases through unclean water and contaminated food, and by affecting [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] organisms (such as [[mosquitoes]]) and intermediate or reservoir host species that harbour the infectious agent (such as cattle,<ref name=\"LundeLindtjorn 2013CattleClimate\">{{cite journal |author1=Lunde, T.M.  |author2=Lindtj\u00f8rn, B. | year=2013 | title= Cattle and climate in Africa: How climate variability has influenced national cattle holdings from 1961\u20132008 | journal=[[PeerJ (journal)|PeerJ]] | doi=10.7717/peerj.55 |pmid=23638393  |pmc=3629083  | volume = 1 | pages = e55 | issue=1}}</ref> [[bat]]s and [[rodents]]).

[[Dengue fever]] is spread by the bite of the female mosquito known as ''[[Aedes aegypti]].'' This species of mosquito can travel up to 400 meters in search of water to lay their eggs, but often remain closer to human habitation. A [[mosquito]] becomes infected with dengue when it bites and takes the blood of an infected human. After approximately one week, the mosquito can then transmit the dengue infection to other humans through her bite. While dengue cannot be spread from person to person, an infected person can infect more mosquitos, thus, furthering the spread of the disease. Overall, the female mosquito is a highly effective vector of this disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/faq/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Dengue/Severe dengue frequently asked questions|website=WHO|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen bitten by an infected mosquito, dengue has an [[incubation period]] of 4\u201310 days. Once infected with the dengue virus, humans experience severe flu-like symptoms. Also known as \"break-bone fever\", dengue can affect infants, children, and adults and can be fatal. Those infected exhibit a [[high fever]] (40&nbsp;\u00b0C/ 104&nbsp;\u00b0F) along with at least two of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eye, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, muscle and joint pains, and rash. These symptoms usually last 2\u20137 days. Dengue can become fatal due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. Warning signs of this include a decrease in temperature decrease (below 38&nbsp;\u00b0C/ 100&nbsp;\u00b0F) in conjunction with: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, blood in vomit, and/or fatigue and restlessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/human/en/|title=WHO {{!}} The human|website=WHO|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nWhere the mosquito, ''Aedes aegypti'', lives and the amount of mosquitos present is strongly influenced by the amount of water-bearing containers or pockets of standstill water in an area, daily temperature and variation in temperature, moisture, and solar radiation.<ref>Patz, J.

Effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihood and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888|title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People|access-date=10 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233729/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888|archive-date=5 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[IPCC]] has estimated that 150 million environmental migrants will exist by the year 2050, due mainly to the effects of coastal flooding, shoreline erosion and agricultural disruption.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050223042051/http://www.risingtide.nl/greenpepper/envracism/refugees.html Hidden statistics: environmental refugees] Hidden statistics: environmental refugees.</ref>  However, the IPCC also cautions that it is extremely difficult to measure the extent of environmental migration due to the complexity of the issue and a lack of data.<ref name=wilbanks />\n\nAccording to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka.

They are not willing to leave their homes, land and families.

Minimising these risks by building in less disaster prone areas, can be expensive and impossible in countries with coastal locations or [[island state]]s. All [[thermal power station]]s depend on water to cool them.  Not only is there increased demand for fresh water, but climate change can increase the likelihood of [[drought]] and [[Water shortage|fresh water shortages]]. Another impact for thermal power plants, is that increasing the temperatures in which they operate reduces their efficiency and hence their output. The source of oil often comes from areas prone to high natural disaster risks; such as tropical storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and floods. An example is [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s impact on oil extraction in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], as it destroyed 126 oil and gas platforms and damaged 183 more.<ref name=ODI1>Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011.

However, the impact of water shortages on nuclear power plants cooled by rivers will be greater than on other thermal power plants.  This is because old reactor designs with water-cooled cores must run at lower internal temperatures and thus, paradoxically, must dump more heat to the environment to produce a given amount of electricity. This situation has forced some nuclear reactors to be shut down and will do so again unless the cooling systems of these plants are enhanced to provide more capacity.  Nuclear power supply was diminished by low river flow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling. Such shutdowns happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves.  During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power; and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage, and forced the French government to import electricity. Other cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007. In particular: \n* The [[Unterweser Nuclear Power Plant|Unterweser nuclear power plant]] reduced output by 90% between June and September 2003.\n* The [[Isar Nuclear Power Plant|Isar nuclear power plant]] cut production by 60% for 14 days due to excess river temperatures and low stream flow in the river Isar in 2006.\nSimilar events have happened elsewhere in Europe during those same hot summers. Many scientists agree that if [[global warming]] continues, this disruption is likely to increase.<ref name=ODI1/>\n\n=== Hydroelectricity ===\nChanges in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows because of drought, climate change, or upstream dams and diversions, will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir; therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be a power shortage in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]]. Studies from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggests that modest climate changes (such as a 2 degree change in Celsius that could result in a 10% decline in precipitation), might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. [[Brazil]] in particular, is vulnerable due to its having reliance on hydroelectricity as increasing temperatures, lower water flow, and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.<ref name=ODI1 />\n\n\n\n===Insurance===\nAn industry directly affected by the risks of climate change is the [[insurance]] industry.<ref>[http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf Viewpoint] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301073456/http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf |date=1 March 2012 }} American Association of Insurance Services</ref> According to a 2005 report from the Association of British Insurers, limiting carbon emissions could avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s.<ref>Association of British Insurers (2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf \"Financial Risks of Climate Change\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605171753/https://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf |date=5 June 2013 }} summary report</ref> A June 2004 report by the Association of British Insurers declared \"Climate change is not a remote issue for future generations to deal with; it is, in various forms here already, impacting on insurers' businesses now.\"<ref>Association of British Insurers (June 2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf \"A Changing Climate for Insurance:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104126/http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }} A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers\"</ref> The report noted that weather-related risks for households and property were already increasing by 2\u20134% per year due to the changing weather conditions, and claims for storm and flood damages in the UK had doubled to over \u00a36 billion over the period from 1998\u20132003 compared to the previous five years.

Please do NOT change \"are\" to \"is\". Thank you. --> a [[Rock music|rock]] band originally formed in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], in March 1975. The band achieved commercial success in both Australia and the United States. They have sold more than 30 million records; six studio albums reached the top&nbsp;10 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] albums chart including ''[[Diamantina Cocktail]]'' (April 1977) and ''[[First Under the Wire]]'' (July 1979), which both peaked at No.&nbsp;2. Nine singles appeared in the top&nbsp;20 on the related singles chart, with  \"[[Help Is on Its Way]]\" (1977) as their only number-one hit. [[Little River Band#Top 20 U.S. singles|Ten singles reached the top&nbsp;20]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with \"[[Reminiscing]]\" their highest, peaking at No.&nbsp;3. Only ''First Under the Wire'' appeared in the top&nbsp;10 albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nEarly members were [[Beeb Birtles]], [[Ric Formosa]], [[Graeham Goble]], [[Roger McLachlan]], [[Derek Pellicci]] and [[Glenn Shorrock]] AM. Most of the group's 1970s and 1980s material was written by Goble and/or Shorrock, Birtles and [[David Briggs (Australian musician)|David Briggs]] (who replaced Formosa).\n\nLittle River Band have received many music awards in Australia. In May 2001 the [[Australasian Performing Right Association|Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)]], as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named \"[[Cool Change (song)|Cool Change]]\", written by Shorrock, as one of the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time. The 1976 line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellicci, Shorrock and George McArdle (who replaced McLachlan), were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] at the 18th Annual [[ARIA Music Awards of 2004]].\n\nLittle River Band have undergone numerous personnel changes, with over 30 members since their formation. None of the musicians now performing as Little River Band are original members, nor did they contribute to the success the band had in the 1970s.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the 1980s, members included [[John Farnham]], [[David Hirschfelder]], Stephen Housden, [[Wayne Nelson]] and [[Steve Prestwich]]. Currently the line-up is Wayne Nelson (who first joined the band in 1980) with Rich Herring, [[Chris Marion]], Ryan Ricks and Colin Whinnery, none of whom are Australian. Two former members have died, Barry Sullivan in October 2003 (aged 57) and Steve Prestwich in January 2011 (aged 56).\n\n==History==\n===1975\u20131976: Early years===\nLittle River Band was formed in March 1975 in Melbourne as a [[soft rock|harmony rock]] group with [[Glenn Shorrock]] on lead vocals, [[Beeb Birtles]] on guitar and vocals, [[Graeham Goble]] on guitar and vocals, [[Derek Pellicci]] on drums and session players [[Graham Davidge]] on lead guitar and Dave Orams on bass guitar.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Upon formation they were an Australian [[supergroup (music)|super group]], with Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock each from prominent local bands.<ref name=\"Nostalgia Bio\"/> Birtles had been the bass guitarist in the 1960s pop-rock band [[Zoot (band)|Zoot]] (which launched the career of singer-guitarist [[Rick Springfield]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Goble had led [[Adelaide]]-formed folk rock group [[Alison Gros|Allison Gros]] before forming the harmony [[country rock]] band  [[Mississippi (band)|Mississippi]] (joined by Birtles and Pellicci) which had chart success in Australia and built up a strong following on the concert and festival circuit. During 1971\u201372 the original members of Mississippi also recorded as a [[studio band]] under the pseudonym Drummond.<ref name=\"Kimball D\"/> They achieved a number-one hit, for eight consecutive weeks, on the ''[[Go-Set]]'' National Top&nbsp;40 with a novelty cover version of the Rays' song \"[[Daddy Cool (The Rays song)|Daddy Cool]]\".<ref name=\"Go-Set Charts Sep 71\"/>\n\nShorrock had been the lead singer of a 1960s pop band, [[The Twilights (band)|the Twilights]], and an early 1970s country rock group, [[Axiom (Australian band)|Axiom]] (alongside singer-songwriter [[Brian Cadd]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Both Axiom and Mississippi had tried to break into the United Kingdom record market without success.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Axiom disbanded after moving to the UK, and Shorrock sang for a short period with a more progressive rock outfit, [[Esperanto (progressive rock band)|Esperanto]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\nIn 1974, Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock met in London with [[Glenn Wheatley]] (former bass player of [[the Masters Apprentices]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> With Wheatley as manager, they agreed to reconvene in Melbourne in early 1975.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Due to the indifferent reception they had each received in the UK, they decided their new band would establish itself in the United States.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Wheatley's first-hand experiences of the rip-offs in the 1960s music scene, combined with his experience working in music management in the UK and the US in the early 1970s, allowed him to help the Little River Band become the first Australian group to enjoy consistent commercial and chart success in the US.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"O'Connor\"/>\n\n[[File:Little_River_sign.jpg|thumb|A road sign to [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]], on a trip by the fledgling band from [[Melbourne]] to [[Geelong]], inspired Glenn Shorrock to suggest the band name]]\nAfter their return to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, ''Paper Paradise'' (1999), he described how they obtained their name: \"It was now time to get out of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience \u2013 somewhere without any fanfare, somewhere out of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in [[Geelong]] for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, we passed the turn-off for [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]]. From the back of the truck, Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What about the Little River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi.\"<ref name=\"Wheatley\"/> On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]].<ref name=\"graehamgoble.com\"/> They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.<ref name=\"graehamgoble.com\"/><ref name=\"chuckthewriter.com\"/>\n\nLittle River Band had recorded their first track, a cover version of the [[The Everly Brothers|Everly Brothers]]' song \"[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]\" in February 1975,<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> at [[Armstrong Studios]], but [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s version appeared in March 1975 \u2013 so LRB did not release theirs.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Before the group began playing concerts, Graham Davidge was replaced by [[Ric Formosa]] on guitar, and Dave Orams by Roger McLachlan on bass guitar and backing vocals.<ref name=\"Wheatley\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> It was guitarist [[Phil Manning (musician)|Phil Manning]], formerly of the band [[Chain (band)|Chain]], that was LRB's first choice for lead guitar duties.

After our return from recording in Montserrat, during a meeting at Glenn Wheatley's house, Graeham was quite vocal about David's conduct. He confronted Dave and virtually fired him. With Glenn, I would go overboard trying to please him but rarely got anything back from him. I found him hard to read at times as he's a man of few words. After he took his frustration out on me one day during a rehearsal, I spoke my mind and told him in no uncertain terms how I felt and in a meeting with Glenn, Graeham and Wheatley, I said I couldn't work with Glenn anymore. Graeham, who had always been at opposite poles to Shorrock, agreed with me and Wheatley started freaking out saying he thought it was a big mistake. What was Capital Records going to say?

Please do NOT change \"are\" to \"is\". Thank you. --> a [[Rock music|rock]] band originally formed in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], in March 1975. The band achieved commercial success in both Australia and the United States. They have sold more than 30 million records; six studio albums reached the top&nbsp;10 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] albums chart including ''[[Diamantina Cocktail]]'' (April 1977) and ''[[First Under the Wire]]'' (July 1979), which both peaked at No.&nbsp;2. Nine singles appeared in the top&nbsp;20 on the related singles chart, with  \"[[Help Is on Its Way]]\" (1977) as their only number-one hit. [[Little River Band#Top 20 U.S. singles|Ten singles reached the top&nbsp;20]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with \"[[Reminiscing]]\" their highest, peaking at No.&nbsp;3. Only ''First Under the Wire'' appeared in the top&nbsp;10 albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nEarly members were [[Beeb Birtles]], [[Ric Formosa]], [[Graeham Goble]], [[Roger McLachlan]], [[Derek Pellicci]] and [[Glenn Shorrock]] AM. Most of the group's 1970s and 1980s material was written by Goble and/or Shorrock, Birtles and [[David Briggs (Australian musician)|David Briggs]] (who replaced Formosa).\n\nLittle River Band have received many music awards in Australia. In May 2001 the [[Australasian Performing Right Association|Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)]], as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named \"[[Cool Change (song)|Cool Change]]\", written by Shorrock, as one of the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time. The 1976 line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellicci, Shorrock and George McArdle (who replaced McLachlan), were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] at the 18th Annual [[ARIA Music Awards of 2004]].\n\nLittle River Band have undergone numerous personnel changes, with over 30 members since their formation. None of the musicians now performing as Little River Band are original members, nor did they contribute to the success the band had in the 1970s.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the 1980s, members included [[John Farnham]], [[David Hirschfelder]], Stephen Housden, [[Wayne Nelson]] and [[Steve Prestwich]]. Currently the line-up is Wayne Nelson (who first joined the band in 1980) with Rich Herring, [[Chris Marion]], Ryan Ricks and Colin Whinnery, none of whom are Australian. Two former members have died, Barry Sullivan in October 2003 (aged 57) and Steve Prestwich in January 2011 (aged 56).\n\n==History==\n===1975\u20131976: Early years===\nLittle River Band was formed in March 1975 in Melbourne as a [[soft rock|harmony rock]] group with [[Glenn Shorrock]] on lead vocals, [[Beeb Birtles]] on guitar and vocals, [[Graeham Goble]] on guitar and vocals, [[Derek Pellicci]] on drums and session players [[Graham Davidge]] on lead guitar and Dave Orams on bass guitar.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Upon formation they were an Australian [[supergroup (music)|super group]], with Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock each from prominent local bands.<ref name=\"Nostalgia Bio\"/> Birtles had been the bass guitarist in the 1960s pop-rock band [[Zoot (band)|Zoot]] (which launched the career of singer-guitarist [[Rick Springfield]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Goble had led [[Adelaide]]-formed folk rock group [[Alison Gros|Allison Gros]] before forming the harmony [[country rock]] band  [[Mississippi (band)|Mississippi]] (joined by Birtles and Pellicci) which had chart success in Australia and built up a strong following on the concert and festival circuit. During 1971\u201372 the original members of Mississippi also recorded as a [[studio band]] under the pseudonym Drummond.<ref name=\"Kimball D\"/> They achieved a number-one hit, for eight consecutive weeks, on the ''[[Go-Set]]'' National Top&nbsp;40 with a novelty cover version of the Rays' song \"[[Daddy Cool (The Rays song)|Daddy Cool]]\".<ref name=\"Go-Set Charts Sep 71\"/>\n\nShorrock had been the lead singer of a 1960s pop band, [[The Twilights (band)|the Twilights]], and an early 1970s country rock group, [[Axiom (Australian band)|Axiom]] (alongside singer-songwriter [[Brian Cadd]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Both Axiom and Mississippi had tried to break into the United Kingdom record market without success.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Axiom disbanded after moving to the UK, and Shorrock sang for a short period with a more progressive rock outfit, [[Esperanto (progressive rock band)|Esperanto]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\nIn 1974, Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock met in London with [[Glenn Wheatley]] (former bass player of [[the Masters Apprentices]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> With Wheatley as manager, they agreed to reconvene in Melbourne in early 1975.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Due to the indifferent reception they had each received in the UK, they decided their new band would establish itself in the United States.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Wheatley's first-hand experiences of the rip-offs in the 1960s music scene, combined with his experience working in music management in the UK and the US in the early 1970s, allowed him to help the Little River Band become the first Australian group to enjoy consistent commercial and chart success in the US.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"O'Connor\"/>\n\n[[File:Little_River_sign.jpg|thumb|A road sign to [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]], on a trip by the fledgling band from [[Melbourne]] to [[Geelong]], inspired Glenn Shorrock to suggest the band name]]\nAfter their return to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, ''Paper Paradise'' (1999), he described how they obtained their name: \"It was now time to get out of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience \u2013 somewhere without any fanfare, somewhere out of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in [[Geelong]] for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, we passed the turn-off for [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]]. From the back of the truck, Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What about the Little River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi.\"<ref name=\"Wheatley\"/> On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]].<ref name=\"graehamgoble.com\"/> They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.<ref name=\"graehamgoble.com\"/><ref name=\"chuckthewriter.com\"/>\n\nLittle River Band had recorded their first track, a cover version of the [[The Everly Brothers|Everly Brothers]]' song \"[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]\" in February 1975,<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> at [[Armstrong Studios]], but [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s version appeared in March 1975 \u2013 so LRB did not release theirs.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Before the group began playing concerts, Graham Davidge was replaced by [[Ric Formosa]] on guitar, and Dave Orams by Roger McLachlan on bass guitar and backing vocals.<ref name=\"Wheatley\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> It was guitarist [[Phil Manning (musician)|Phil Manning]], formerly of the band [[Chain (band)|Chain]], that was LRB's first choice for lead guitar duties. Manning was busy cultivating a solo career so he recommended Ric Formosa to Wheatley. Formosa had recently travelled to Australia from Canada and working in a music store. He was asked to audition and received a phone call soon after with an invitation to join the band.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moon |first1=Jackson |title=Ric Formosa Interview with Jackson Moon |url=https://www.midi.com.au/jacks-place-australian-music/ |website=Hit Trax MIDI Files |accessdate=8 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808104609/https://www.midi.com.au/jacks-place-australian-music/ |archive-date=8 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1975, they signed with [[EMI Records]] and started recording their debut [[Little River Band (album)|self-titled album]] (November 1975) at Armstrong Studios in June.

It was produced by the band but was not issued in the US until 1980 and then first as a CD in 1997 on [[One Way Records]], with three bonus tracks.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> ''After Hours'' peaked at No.&nbsp;5 and provided the single \"Everyday of My Life\", in May, which reached the top&nbsp;30.\n\n===1976\u20131982: Success and changes of personnel===\nDuring August 1976, both Formosa and McLachlan were replaced: [[David Briggs (Australian musician)|David Briggs]] joined on guitar (ex-Cycle, the Avengers, Ram Band) and George McArdle on bass guitar (also ex-Ram Band).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"somethingelsereviews.com\"/> Formosa (according to Wheatley's aforementioned book), not enthusiastic about touring outside of Australia, left the group to pursue other musical interests, working as a session musician and as a composer and arranger. At the same time, the group decided to also replace bassist Roger McLachlan, who also became a sessions player and subsequently joined the Australian country rock group [[Stars (Australian band)|Stars]]<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Mantague\"/> Formosa remained in touch with LRB and conducted and wrote string parts for several tracks on subsequent albums.<ref name=\"AMG Formosa\"/>\n\nEncouraged by their Australian success, the band undertook their first international tour.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> They flew to the UK on 17 September 1976 to play a show in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] supporting [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. They then opened shows in the rest of Europe for [[the Hollies]] during September and October.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Birtles advised fellow Australian bands that \"It's so much easier when you have a product to sell...

The label selected tracks from it and from their third Australian one, ''[[Diamantina Cocktail]]'' (April 1977), to create Capitol's second US album, also titled ''Diamantina Cocktail'' (June 1977).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The Australian version was co-produced by the group with [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] \u2013 who stayed on to co-produce their next two studio albums.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Due to tension between band members Birtles, Goble and Shorrock recorded as much of their parts individually as was feasible.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\n''The Canberra Times''{{'}} Julie Meldrum caught their performance in May 1977, which \"moved along at a rapid pace and slowed down only once with a few laid-back tracks towards the middle of the set\" and described the band as \"tightly disciplined musicians. All the instruments were played clearly and it was obvious that collectively or individually there was nothing that was not world class.\"<ref name=\"Meldrum\"/> Meldrum also reviewed the album, which had \"no references to Australia\" and felt \"it is obvious that the band is trying to ensconce itself in the Los Angeles scene ...

After our return from recording in Montserrat, during a meeting at Glenn Wheatley's house, Graeham was quite vocal about David's conduct. He confronted Dave and virtually fired him. With Glenn, I would go overboard trying to please him but rarely got anything back from him. I found him hard to read at times as he's a man of few words. After he took his frustration out on me one day during a rehearsal, I spoke my mind and told him in no uncertain terms how I felt and in a meeting with Glenn, Graeham and Wheatley, I said I couldn't work with Glenn anymore. Graeham, who had always been at opposite poles to Shorrock, agreed with me and Wheatley started freaking out saying he thought it was a big mistake. What was Capital Records going to say?
