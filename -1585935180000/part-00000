After earning his BA in [[Political economy|political economics]], he worked as an [[archivist]] for nine years in the [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] branch of the Royal Archives from 1935 to 1944. During that time, he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[history]] in 1937. His work at the archives also allowed him to hide escaped prisoners during the [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1935, he was offered a position as professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and received a [[tenure]] there in 1947. He taught historical critics (\"Diplomatique\"), [[methodology]], [[History of Belgium|Belgian history]] and [[Medievalism|Middle Age history]]. In his research, he was particularly interested in the [[Walloons|Walloon]] history ([[Wallonia]], Histoire de la Wallonie). \n\nHis contribution to Medieval History is well known, and his books and articles are used today in many medieval history classes ([http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/srwhms.html], [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~history/facdata/examreading/Medieval_History_3010.pdf]).\n\nIn 1963, persuaded of the academic value of interdisciplinarity he established a ''Rural History'' research centre (''Centre d'Histoire Rurale'') and, later still, a centre for ''History ecology'' (''un Centre d'\u00e9cologie historique'', in the words of the great medievalist Georges Duby), thus inviting historians to work hand in hand with geographers, agronomers, and other specialists of the [[Earth Sciences]] in the newly established ''Institut Interfacultaire d'\u00c9tudes M\u00e9di\u00e9vales'' (or simply, ''Institut d'\u00c9tudes M\u00e9di\u00e9vales'' as is better known).\n\nIn 1972, given that historiens assemble academic discourses that draw on all sorts of documents that must be treated according to their specific characteristics, he decided to start publishing a collection of small monographies, the ''Typologie des sources du Moyen \u00c2ge occidental'' (i.e. ''typology of sources for [the study of] western Middle Ages'') for which he devised the editorial plan and wrote the first volume, ''Introduction'' in that same year. The whole of this collection has acquired enormous academic prestige and has continued to be published by the belgian academic press [http://www.brepols.net/Pages/Home.aspx Brepols Publishers]. This collection was to serve a scholarly base of [[Medieval studies|medievalists]] ranging from graduate students to professors and has become one of the most successful collections of introductory and bibliographical aids ever presented to the academic community of medieval history scholars. By publishing three to four titles a year, the series has steadily grown to seventy-eight volumes, covering everything in medieval studies and culture, from necrological documents to Latin treatises on the virtues and the vices, from [[History_of_astronomy#Medieval_Western_Europe|astronomy]] to [[List of medieval weapons|arms]] and [[armour]]. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v041/41.1devries.html]\n\n===A ''Patriotic Militant''===\nA [[Wallonie | Wallon]] himself, he was a catholic and a political militant on behalf of the national causes of [[Wallonia|Wallonie]] and the Wallons, having been a member of [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9novation_wallonne ''R\u00e9novation wallone''] and a candidate for ''[[Rassemblement wallon]]'' on the [[European Parliament|european elections]]. As a politician, in 1995, by the time of his demise, his patriotic vues had become gradually more regionalistic favouring either an independent Wallonia either its integration into France.\n\n== Awards, Honours and Distinctions ==\nIn 1964, he received the \"Guaillarde d'Argent\"[http://www.ville.namur.be/pericles/evenemen/wallonie01/08-2.htm] and in 1982, he received an honorary degree from the [[Catholic University of Lublin]] (KUL) [http://www.kul.lublin.pl/art_158.html]. In 1988, he was awarded the prize \"Personnalit\u00e9 Richelieu\" [http://www.dmnet.be/richelieu/main/fr/pgstfr/persofr.html] by the R\u00e9gionale Belgique-Luxembourg branch du \"Richelieu International\".\n\nHe was the father of the architectural historian Luc-Francis Genicot (1938-2007), and the great uncle of [[Garance Genicot]].\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nSee [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904134710/http://library.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/medieval/typ.html], [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~history/facdata/examreading/Medieval_History_3010.pdf], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060103082042/http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/FLTR/ARKE/CHAB/Accueil.html].\n\n==== Monographies (incomplete) ====\n\n* ''Histoire des routes belges depuis 1704'', Bruxelles: Office de publicit\u00e9, 1948.\n* ''Principe de Critique Historique''.

{"title_page": "Mariano Brull", "text_new": "'''Mariano Brull Caballero''' (February 24, 1891 \u2013 June 8, 1956) was a Cuban poet usually associated with the French [[Symbolist]] movement.  Two Symbolists who strongly influenced him were [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]].  Among Cuban poets of the first half of the 20th century he was the most outstanding of those who wrote [[poetry]] for poetry's sake, as opposed to poetry that addressed social issues or poetry that was inspired by the culture of Cubans of African descent.  Because of his interest in the sounds of words, he is known for a type of poetry called \"jitanj\u00e1fora\" in which the words are virtually meaningless, their sounds all-important.  A diplomat by profession, he lived many years in various countries of Europe and the Americas.\n[[File:Brull Mariano in 1913 when he was 22 rbz.JPG|thumb|MARIANO BRULL (1891-1956) upon graduation from the University of Havana in 1913]]\n\n==Biography==\nBrull was born in [[Camag\u00fcey]], in eastern [[Cuba]], where his father, Miguel Brull, a Spanish army officer, was stationed.  His mother, Celia Caballero, was descended from a family that had resided in Cuba for many generations.\n\n===Early life===\nAs a child he lived in [[Ceuta]]  and [[M\u00e1laga]] in Spain.  It was during his teenage years, as a student in Camag\u00fcey, that he discovered his passion for poetry.  He and other students founded a short-lived magazine for which they wrote poems and essays.<ref>Parker, William B. ed. (1919). ''Cubans of Today'' of the Hispanic Society of America. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. p.109.</ref>  Eagerly reading all the poetry he could, young Brull was especially struck by the work of the French Symbolist poets.\n\nIn 1908 he moved to [[Havana]] where he attended the university, graduating with a Doctor of Law degree at age 22.  He worked in a law office but also wrote poetry for the magazine ''El F\u00edgaro''.  During 1914 and 1915 he was a member of the small group that formed around the Dominican literary critic, [[Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a]].<ref>Brull, Mariano (2001). ''Obras (Poes\u00eda y Prosa: 1916-1955)''. ed. Emilio de Armas. Boulder, Co.: Society of Spanish and Spanish-American Studies. p.li. {{ISBN|0-89295-098-6}}.</ref>  Henr\u00edquez, believing Brull had a future as a poet, became his mentor, introducing him to editors and suggesting he read poets whom Brull was not familiar with.\n\nIn 1916 Brull published his first book of poetry, ''La casa del silencio''. Shortly afterwards he married Adela Baralt and, switching careers, entered the Cuban diplomatic service.  Brull was determined to leave Cuba where, exhausted by years fighting for independence and preoccupied by problems facing any new country, the arts were confused and anemic, uninterested in the great experiments ([[Cubism]], [[futurism]], etc.) taking place in Europe.<ref>\"Poes\u00eda\", \"Vanguardismo\".

Retrieved 2007.</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic life===\nThough impatient to reach [[Europe]], the first two countries he was sent to as a diplomat were the [[United States]] and [[Peru]]. In the mid 20s he was stationed in [[Madrid]].  There he had the good fortune to participate in the reunions of the literary caf\u00e9s frequented by many of the best poets Spain was to produce in the 20th century: [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], and many others.<ref>Brull, Mariano (2000).

Madrid: Ediciones C\u00e1tedra. p.46. {{ISBN|84-376-1856-8}}.</ref>  While in Madrid, some of Brull's early poetry was published in [[Paris]] in a French translation.\n\nIn 1923 Brull joined about 60 young professionals of Havana who decided to take a public stance against the reigning passivity and mediocrity in politics and culture.  Called El Grupo Minorista (the Minority Group),<ref>Brull. ''Obras''. p. li.</ref> they demanded an end to years of cultural backwardness and an aggressive affirmation of the new artistic tendencies coming out of Europe.  In politics, they denounced dictatorships and called for the formation of a Cuban government more responsive to the people.<ref>\"El Grupo Minorista\".

Retrieved 2007.</ref>\n\nIn 1928 he published his second book of poetry, ''Poemas en menguante''.  Though also published in Paris, where he was now living, it was written in Spanish.  All of his books were small editions for friends and family, paid for out of his pocket.\n\nThe Brulls lived in Paris from 1927 to 1934 with only two interruptions: a year, each, in Berne and Havana.  The return of the Brulls to Havana coincided with numerous riots and demonstrations as students clashed with the police of the government of President [[Gerardo Machado]], an increasingly ruthless [[dictator]].\n\nBrull spent the [[Great Depression]] back in Paris.  Two or three times a year found him traveling.  He frequently visited Havana, on business; southern Spain, the land of his childhood; and [[Mexico City]] where he called on his friends [[Gabriela Mistral]], the Chilean poet, [[Alfonso Reyes]], the Mexican man-of-letters, and others.<ref>Heliodoro Valle, Rafael (1947). \"Di\u00e1logo con Mariano Brull.\" ''Revista de la Universidad de M\u00e9xico''. Ciudad de M\u00e9xico: Universidad de M\u00e9xico. vol II. p.24.</ref>\n\nIn 1934 his third book of poetry, ''Canto redondo'', was brought out in Paris.  He was stationed in [[Rome]] between 1934 and 1937 where [[fascism]] was alive and thriving.\n\nAfter moving to [[Brussels]] (for the second time) at the end of the 1930s, Brull was in charge of attending to the many German [[Jews]] who, seeking [[visa (document)|visas]] to emigrate, had lined up before the [[legations]] and [[embassies]] of numerous countries.  During these years he was Cuba's delegate to the XVII Reunion of the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] and, also, Commissioner for the repatriation of Cubans fleeing the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>Garc\u00eda Morales, Alfonso (1984). \"La Obra de Mariano Brull\".

Sevilla: Universidad de Sevilla). p.126.</ref>  Brull had decided that an all-European war was imminent\u2014though most of his colleagues and friends disagreed\u2014and pressured the Ministry to be sent back to Havana.  He left in June, 1939.  The ship carrying all of the Brull's household effects to Cuba, a year later, was torpedoed by the Germans and sank.\n\nIn 1939, a bilingual (French-Spanish) book, ''Po\u00ebmes'', came out in Paris, with a preface written by one of the greatest literary figures of France at the time, Paul Val\u00e9ry.  Brull worked for many years on a translation into Spanish of Val\u00e9ry's most famous, and difficult, poems: \"Le Cimeti\u00e9re Marin\" (The Graveyard by the Sea) and \"La Jeune Parque\" (The Young Fate).<ref>Allain-Castrillo, Monique (1995).

Brull admired people who were capable of both action and thought.  He had no use for the static attitude of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]\u00b4s famous statue, \"The Thinker\".<ref>Brull, Mariano (1951). \"Frente y Perfil del Coronel Cosme de la Torriente y Peraza, El Libertador Infatigable\".

No other Cuban poet went as far as Brull in immersing himself in this conception of poetry.  But his Latin American origin do not allow him to forget the stems and leaves altogether.  Brull's contribution to the poetry of Cuba is this counterpoint between the concrete and the ideal.<ref>Brull. ''Obras''. p. xxx.</ref>\n\nAn equilibrium between the sensual and the abstract is most fully reached in ''Solo de rosas'', a collection of poems in which the poet praises the rose in its pure essence, fragile and wondrous, and not corrupted by the passage of time.<ref>Brull.

''Obras''. ed. de Armas. p. xiii.</ref>  The roots of this desolation are evident in his first poems in which absence and silence\u2014often depicted as quietness\u2014are present yet any discomfort is dispelled by the vision of ideal beauty.  By the 1950s, absence is no longer a friendly notion as it veers into nothingness.  Brull is consumed by a tragic vision of life in which all things, including beauty, are conceived of as subject to destruction or, a word he often chose, ruin.  Once time has done its task, only nothingness remains.<ref>Garc\u00eda Morales. pp.282, 290.</ref>  \u201cNever had Cuban poetry reached so far into desperation with such discreteness and solitude.\u201d<ref>Brull.

Two Symbolists who strongly influenced him were [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]].  Among Cuban poets of the first half of the 20th century he was the most outstanding of those who wrote [[poetry]] for poetry's sake, as opposed to poetry that addressed social issues or poetry that was inspired by the culture of Cubans of African descent.  Because of his interest in the sounds of words, he is known for a type of poetry called \"jitanj\u00e1fora\" in which the words are virtually meaningless, their sounds all-important.  A diplomat by profession, he lived many years in various countries of Europe and the Americas.\n[[File:Brull Mariano in 1913 when he was 22 rbz.JPG|thumb|MARIANO BRULL (1891-1956) upon graduation from the University of Havana in 1913]]\n\n==Biography==\nBrull was born in [[Camag\u00fcey]], in eastern [[Cuba]], where his father, Miguel Brull, a Spanish army officer, was stationed.  His mother, Celia Caballero, was descended from a family that had resided in Cuba for many generations.\n\n===Early life===\nAs a child he lived in [[Ceuta]]  and [[M\u00e1laga]] in Spain.  It was during his teenage years, as a student in Camag\u00fcey, that he discovered his passion for poetry.  He and other students founded a short-lived magazine for which they wrote poems and essays.<ref>Parker, William B. ed. (1919). ''Cubans of Today'' of the Hispanic Society of America. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. p.109.</ref>  Eagerly reading all the poetry he could, young Brull was especially struck by the work of the French Symbolist poets.\n\nIn 1908 he moved to [[Havana]] where he attended the university, graduating with a Doctor of Law degree at age 22.  He worked in a law office but also wrote poetry for the magazine ''El F\u00edgaro''.  During 1914 and 1915 he was a member of the small group that formed around the Dominican literary critic, [[Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a]].<ref>Brull, Mariano (2001).

Shortly afterwards he married Adela Baralt and, switching careers, entered the Cuban diplomatic service.  Brull was determined to leave Cuba where, exhausted by years fighting for independence and preoccupied by problems facing any new country, the arts were confused and anemic, uninterested in the great experiments ([[Cubism]], [[futurism]], etc.) taking place in Europe.<ref>\"Poes\u00eda\", \"Vanguardismo\".

In the mid 20s he was stationed in [[Madrid]].  There he had the good fortune to participate in the reunions of the literary caf\u00e9s frequented by many of the best poets Spain was to produce in the 20th century: [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], and many others.<ref>Brull, Mariano (2000).

Called El Grupo Minorista (the Minority Group),<ref>Brull. ''Obras''. p. li.</ref> they demanded an end to years of cultural backwardness and an aggressive affirmation of the new artistic tendencies coming out of Europe.

All of his books were small editions for friends and family, paid for out of his pocket.\n\nThe Brulls lived in Paris from 1927 to 1934 with only two interruptions: a year, each, in Berne and Havana.  The return of the Brulls to Havana coincided with numerous riots and demonstrations as students clashed with the police of the government of President [[Gerardo Machado]], an increasingly ruthless [[dictator]].\n\nBrull spent the [[Great Depression]] back in Paris.  Two or three times a year found him traveling.  He frequently visited Havana, on business; southern Spain, the land of his childhood; and [[Mexico City]] where he called on his friends [[Gabriela Mistral]], the Chilean poet, [[Alfonso Reyes]], the Mexican man-of-letters, and others.<ref>Heliodoro Valle, Rafael (1947). \"Di\u00e1logo con Mariano Brull.\" ''Revista de la Universidad de M\u00e9xico''.

During these years he was Cuba's delegate to the XVII Reunion of the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] and, also, Commissioner for the repatriation of Cubans fleeing the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>Garc\u00eda Morales, Alfonso (1984). \"La Obra de Mariano Brull\".

He left in June, 1939.  The ship carrying all of the Brull's household effects to Cuba, a year later, was torpedoed by the Germans and sank.\n\nIn 1939, a bilingual (French-Spanish) book, ''Po\u00ebmes'', came out in Paris, with a preface written by one of the greatest literary figures of France at the time, Paul Val\u00e9ry.  Brull worked for many years on a translation into Spanish of Val\u00e9ry's most famous, and difficult, poems: \"Le Cimeti\u00e9re Marin\" (The Graveyard by the Sea) and \"La Jeune Parque\" (The Young Fate).<ref>Allain-Castrillo, Monique (1995).

''Obras''. ed. de Armas. p. xii.</ref>\n\nMallarm\u00e9 had defined a flower as the absence of the stem and leaves, his way of stating that the finality of art is the concentration on the [[essence]].  No other Cuban poet went as far as Brull in immersing himself in this conception of poetry.  But his Latin American origin do not allow him to forget the stems and leaves altogether.  Brull's contribution to the poetry of Cuba is this counterpoint between the concrete and the ideal.<ref>Brull. ''Obras''. p. xxx.</ref>\n\nAn equilibrium between the sensual and the abstract is most fully reached in ''Solo de rosas'', a collection of poems in which the poet praises the rose in its pure essence, fragile and wondrous, and not corrupted by the passage of time.<ref>Brull.

''Poes\u00eda''. ed. M\u00fcller-Bergh. pp.39, 66-67. and Garc\u00eda Morales. p. 278.</ref>\n\nThroughout the years one can find, beneath the formal and expressive clarity, Brull's increasing concern of what he saw as a world in permanent deterioration.<ref>Brull. ''Obras''. ed. de Armas. p. xiii.</ref>  The roots of this desolation are evident in his first poems in which absence and silence\u2014often depicted as quietness\u2014are present yet any discomfort is dispelled by the vision of ideal beauty.  By the 1950s, absence is no longer a friendly notion as it veers into nothingness.  Brull is consumed by a tragic vision of life in which all things, including beauty, are conceived of as subject to destruction or, a word he often chose, ruin.  Once time has done its task, only nothingness remains.<ref>Garc\u00eda Morales. pp.282, 290.</ref>  \u201cNever had Cuban poetry reached so far into desperation with such discreteness and solitude.\u201d<ref>Brull.

The purpose of the reports was to \u201cform a basis for a better understanding of the applications of weather information to future operations.\u201d Later, van Straten transferred to the [[research and development|R & D section]], where she worked for the rest of the war on radar and other new technologies.<ref name=\"FPRI\" />\n\nBy 1943, van Straten had been assigned to the headquarters staff, the Aerology section of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], where she worked in the Operational Analysis Section.

The [[battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942 was such an instance. The American fleet used the clouds and precipitation of a trailing frontal system to provide cover, slipping out to attack the exposed Japanese naval force and then disappearing again into the heavy weather. In this way they were able to sink the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dh\u014d]], seriously damaged another carrier, and shoot down numerous enemy planes. But when they departed the frontal zone to operate in fair weather, they immediately lost the carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}}.<ref name=\"AWS\" />\n\nVan Straten helped develop methods of using weather phenomena, such as storms, in the planning of ship maneuvers and [[carrier-based airplane]] flights. Her work also included development of a technique to modify clouds and produce rain by injecting carbon black into the atmosphere. As a weather trouble-shooter for the Navy, she dealt with problems ranging from fog to [[radioactive fallout]]. She also developed a radar facsimile system and patented a sonic device for preventing ice buildup on planes.<ref name=\"AWS\" /><ref name=\"highbeam\" />\n\nShe was instrumental in the development of the [[rocketsonde]], which launched a data-collecting package, called a [[radiosonde]], into the upper atmosphere. It was at her suggestion that meteorological data be used in planning the trajectory of rocket launches. She also developed the constant-altitude [[weather balloon]].

She also wrote the report on the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids]], tactical airstrikes over islands in [[Micronesia]]. The purpose of the reports was to \u201cform a basis for a better understanding of the applications of weather information to future operations.\u201d Later, van Straten transferred to the [[research and development|R & D section]], where she worked for the rest of the war on radar and other new technologies.<ref name=\"FPRI\" />\n\nBy 1943, van Straten had been assigned to the headquarters staff, the Aerology section of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], where she worked in the Operational Analysis Section.

The [[battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942 was such an instance. The American fleet used the clouds and precipitation of a trailing frontal system to provide cover, slipping out to attack the exposed Japanese naval force and then disappearing again into the heavy weather. In this way they were able to sink the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dh\u014d]], seriously damaged another carrier, and shoot down numerous enemy planes. But when they departed the frontal zone to operate in fair weather, they immediately lost the carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}}.<ref name=\"AWS\" />\n\nVan Straten helped develop methods of using weather phenomena, such as storms, in the planning of ship maneuvers and [[carrier-based airplane]] flights. Her work also included development of a technique to modify clouds and produce rain by injecting carbon black into the atmosphere. As a weather trouble-shooter for the Navy, she dealt with problems ranging from fog to [[radioactive fallout]]. She also developed a radar facsimile system and patented a sonic device for preventing ice buildup on planes.<ref name=\"AWS\" /><ref name=\"highbeam\" />\n\nShe was instrumental in the development of the [[rocketsonde]], which launched a data-collecting package, called a [[radiosonde]], into the upper atmosphere. It was at her suggestion that meteorological data be used in planning the trajectory of rocket launches. She also developed the constant-altitude [[weather balloon]]. The deflated balloon was carried aloft by a bubble of [[helium]]. The balloon inflated as the atmosphere became thinner until it was full, at which point its altitude remained constant.

Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated [[jazz]] in the early 1940s when [[swing music|swing]] was most popular. The term \"big band\" is also used to describe a genre of music, although this was not the only style of music played by big bands.\n\nBig bands started as accompaniment for dancing. In contrast to the typical jazz emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Jazz ensemble - seating diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Typical seating arrangement for a 17-piece big band]]\nBig bands have four sections: trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and a rhythm section of guitar, piano, double bass, and drums.<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{cite book|last1=Gioia|first1=Ted|title=The History of Jazz|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539970-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/100 100\u2014]|edition=2|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/100}}</ref><ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|title=Big Band Music Genre Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/big-band-ma0000002461|website=AllMusic|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref> The division in early big bands was likely to be two or three trumpets, one or two trombones, three saxophones, and a rhythm section.<ref name=\"Collier\">{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=James|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries|location=New York| isbn=1-56159-284-6| page=122| volume=1| edition=2nd}}</ref> In 1930, big bands usually consisted of three trumpets, three trombones, three saxophones, and a rhythm section of four instruments. Guitar replaced the [[banjo]], and double bass replaced the [[tuba]]. In the 1940s, [[Stan Kenton]]'s band and [[Woody Herman]]'s band used up to five trumpets, four trombones (three [[Tenor trombone|tenor]], one [[bass trombone]]), five saxophones (two [[alto saxophone]]s, two [[tenor saxophone]]s, one [[baritone saxophone]]), and a rhythm section. An exception is Duke Ellington, who at one time used six trumpets. [[Boyd Raeburn]] drew from [[symphony orchestra]]s by adding to his band flute, [[French horn]], violin, and [[timpani]].<ref name=\"Collier\" />\n\n==Arrangements==\n[[Image:OckbrookBandPridePark.jpg|thumb|Ockbrook Big Band at [[Pride Park Stadium]]]]\nTypical big band [[Head arrangement|arrangements]] are written in [[strophic form]] with the same phrase and chord structure repeated several times. Each iteration, or chorus, commonly follows [[twelve bar blues]] form or [[Thirty-two-bar form|thirty-two-bar (AABA) song form]]. The first chorus of an arrangement introduces the melody and is followed by choruses of development. This development may take the form of improvised solos, written solo sections, and \"[[shout chorus]]es\".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAn arrangement's first chorus is sometimes preceded by an introduction, which may be as short as a few measures or may extend to chorus of its own. Many arrangements contain an interlude, often similar in content to the introduction, inserted between some or all choruses. Other methods of embellishing the form include modulations and cadential extensions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome big ensembles, like [[King Oliver]]'s, played music that was half-arranged, half-improvised, often relying on head arrangements. A head arrangement is a piece of music that is formed by band members during rehearsal. They experiment, then memorize the way they are going to perform the piece, without writing it on sheet music. During the 1930s, [[Count Basie]]'s band often used head arrangements, as Basie said, \"we just sort of start it off and the others fall in.\"<ref name=\"Kernfeld\">{{cite book|last1=Kernfeld|first1=Barry|title=What to Listen to in Jazz|date=1995|publisher=Yale Univ.

As jazz migrated from its New Orleans origin to Chicago and New York City, energetic, suggestive dances traveled with it. During the next decades, ballrooms filled with people doing the [[jitterbug]] and [[Lindy Hop]]. The dance duo [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] popularized the [[foxtrot]] while accompanied by the Europe Society Orchestra led by [[James Reese Europe]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\nOne of the first bands to accompany the new rhythms was led by a drummer, [[Art Hickman]], in San Francisco in 1916. Hickman's arranger, [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]], wrote [[Head arrangement|arrangements]] in which he divided the jazz orchestra into sections that combined in various ways. This intermingling of sections became a defining characteristic of big bands. In 1919, [[Paul Whiteman]] hired Grof\u00e9 to use similar techniques for his band. Whiteman was educated in classical music, and he called his new band's music symphonic jazz. The methods of dance bands marked a step away from New Orleans jazz. With the exception of [[Jelly Roll Morton]], who continued playing in the New Orleans style, bandleaders paid attention to the demand for dance music and created their own big bands.<ref name=\"Collier\" /> They incorporated elements of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[ragtime]], and [[vaudeville]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\n[[Duke Ellington]] led his band at the [[Cotton Club]] in Harlem. [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s career started when he was persuaded to audition for a job at Club Alabam in New York City, which eventually turned into a job as bandleader at the [[Roseland Ballroom]]. At these venues, which themselves gained notoriety, bandleaders and arrangers played a greater role than they had before. Hickman relied on Ferde Grof\u00e9, Whiteman on [[Bill Challis]]. Henderson and arranger [[Don Redman]] followed the template of [[King Oliver]], but as the 1920s progressed they moved away from the New Orleans format and transformed jazz. They were assisted by a band full of talent: [[Coleman Hawkins]] on tenor saxophone, [[Louis Armstrong]] on cornet, and multi-instrumentalist [[Benny Carter]], whose career lasted into the 1990s.<ref name=\"Gioia\" /> WOW\n\n===The swing era===\n[[Image:BennyGoodmanandBandStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Benny Goodman]] and [[Peggy Lee]]]]\n[[Swing music]] began appearing in the early 1930s and was distinguished by a more supple feel than the more literal [[4/4 time|{{music|time|4|4}}]] of early jazz. [[Walter Page]] is often credited with developing the [[walking bass]], though earlier examples exist, such as [[Wellman Braud]] on Ellington's ''Washington Wabble'' from 1927.\n\nThis type of music flourished through the early 1930s, although there was little mass audience for it until around 1936. Up until that time, it was viewed with ridicule and looked upon as a curiosity. After 1935, big bands rose to prominence playing swing music and held a major role in defining swing as a distinctive style. [[Western swing]] musicians also formed popular big bands during the same period.\n\nThere was a considerable range of styles among the hundreds of popular bands. Many of the better known bands reflected the individuality of the bandleader, the lead arranger, and the personnel. Count Basie played a relaxed, propulsive swing, [[Bob Crosby]] more of a dixieland style, [[Benny Goodman]] a hard driving swing, and Duke Ellington's compositions were varied and sophisticated. Many bands featured strong instrumentalists whose sounds dominated, such as the clarinets of Benny Goodman and [[Artie Shaw]], the trombone of [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpet of [[Harry James]], the drums of [[Gene Krupa]], and the vibes of [[Lionel Hampton]]. The popularity of many of the major bands was amplified by star vocalists, such as [[Frank Sinatra]] with [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Helen O'Connell]] and [[Bob Eberly]] with [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]] with [[Chick Webb]], [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Jimmy Rushing]] with [[Count Basie]], [[Dick Haymes]] and [[Helen Forrest]] with [[Harry James]], [[Doris Day]] with [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], and [[Peggy Lee]] with Benny Goodman. Some bands were \"society bands\" which relied on strong ensembles but little on soloists or vocalists, such as the bands of [[Guy Lombardo]] and Paul Whiteman.\n\nBy this time the Big Band was such a dominant force in jazz that the older generation found they either had to adapt to it or simply retire. With no market for small-group recordings (made worse by a Depression-era industry reluctant to take risks), musicians such as Louis Armstrong and [[Earl Hines]] led their own bands, while others, like Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, lapsed into obscurity.\n\nThe major \"black\" bands of the 1930s included, apart from Ellington's, Hines's and Calloway's, those of [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Chick Webb]], and Count Basie. The \"white\" bands of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, [[Shep Fields]] and, later, Glenn Miller were more popular than their \"black\" counterparts from the middle of the decade. Bridging the gap to white audiences in the mid-1930s was the [[Casa Loma Orchestra]] and Benny Goodman's early band.\n\n[[Image:Glen miller.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Glenn Miller]], a major in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, led a 50-piece military band that specialized in Swing music]]\nWhite teenagers and young adults were the principal fans of the Big Bands in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They danced to recordings and the radio and attended live concerts. They were knowledgeable and often biased toward their favorite bands and songs, and sometimes worshipful of famous soloists and vocalists. Many bands toured the country in grueling one-night stands. Traveling conditions and lodging were difficult, in part due to segregation in most parts of the United States, and the personnel often had to perform having had little sleep and food. Apart from the star soloists, many musicians received low wages and would abandon the tour if bookings disappeared. Personal problems and band discord affected the group. Drinking and addiction were common. Turnover was frequent, and top soloists were lured by more lucrative contracts. Sometimes bandstands were too small, public address systems inadequate, pianos out of tune. Bandleaders dealt with these obstacles through rigid discipline (Glenn Miller) and canny psychology ([[Duke Ellington]]). [[Image:Grand Central Big Band.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Central Big Band.]] \n\nBig Bands uplifted morale during [[World War II]]. Many musicians served in the military and toured with [[USO]] troupes at the front, with Glenn Miller losing his life while traveling between shows. Many bands suffered from the loss of personnel and quality declined at home during the war years. The [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike]] worsened the situation. Vocalists began to strike out on their own. By the end of the war, swing was giving way to less danceable music, such as [[bebop]]. Many of the great swing bands broke up, as the times and tastes changed.\n\n===Modern big bands===\nAlthough big bands are identified with the swing era, they continued to exist after those decades, though the music they played was often different from swing. Bandleader [[Charlie Barnet]]'s recording of \"[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]\" in 1942 and \"The Moose\" in 1943 have been called the beginning of the bop era. [[Woody Herman]]'s first band, nicknamed the First Herd, borrowed from progressive jazz, while the Second Herd emphasized the saxophone section of three tenors and one baritone. In the 1950s, [[Stan Kenton]] referred to his band's music as \"progressive jazz\", \"modern\", and \"new music\". He created his band as a vehicle for his compositions. Kenton pushed the boundaries of big bands by combining clashing elements and by hiring arrangers whose ideas about music conflicted. This expansive eclecticism characterized much of jazz after World War II. During the 1960s and '70s, [[Sun Ra]] and his Arketstra took big bands further out. Ra's eclectic music was played by a roster of musicians from ten to thirty and was presented as theater, with costumes, dancers, and special effects.<ref name=\"Gioia\" /> \n\nAs jazz was expanded during the 1950s through the 1970s, the Basie and Ellington bands were still around, as were bands led by [[Buddy Rich]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Clark Terry]], and [[Doc Severinsen]]. Progressive bands were led by [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Toshiko Akiyoshi \u2013 Lew Tabackin Big Band|Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin]], [[Don Ellis]], and [[Anthony Braxton]].\n\nOther bandleaders used [[Brazilian jazz|Brazilian]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz|Afro-Cuban]] music with big band instrumentation, and big bands led by arranger Gil Evans, saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] (on the album ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'' from 1965) and bass guitarist [[Jaco Pastorius]] introduced [[cool jazz]], [[free jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], respectively, to the big band domain. Modern big bands can be found playing all styles of jazz music. Some large contemporary European jazz ensembles play mostly [[avant-garde jazz]] using the instrumentation of the big bands. Examples include the [[Vienna Art Orchestra]], founded in 1977, and the [[Italian Instabile Orchestra]], active in the 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1990s, there was a [[swing revival]] in the U.S. The Lindy Hop became popular again and young people took an interest in big band styles again.\n\nBig bands maintained a presence on American television, particularly through the late-night talk show, which has historically used big bands as [[house band|house accompaniment]]. Typically the most prominent shows with the earliest time slots and largest audiences have bigger bands with horn sections while those in later time slots go with smaller, leaner ensembles.\n\n==Radio==\nDuring the 1930s, [[Earl Hines]] and his band broadcast from [[Sunset Cafe|the Grand Terrace]] in Chicago every night across America.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite web|last1=Travis|first1=Dempsey J.|title=Where The Jazz Was Super-hot| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-03-26/news/8501170148_1_dance-floor-radio-band|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate=6 September 2017|language=en|date=26 March 1985}}</ref> In Kansas City and across the Southwest, an earthier, bluesier style was developed by such bandleaders as [[Bennie Moten]] and, later, by [[Jay McShann]] and [[Jesse Stone]].

Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated [[jazz]] in the early 1940s when [[swing music|swing]] was most popular. The term \"big band\" is also used to describe a genre of music, although this was not the only style of music played by big bands.\n\nBig bands started as accompaniment for dancing. In contrast to the typical jazz emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Jazz ensemble - seating diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Typical seating arrangement for a 17-piece big band]]\nBig bands have four sections: trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and a rhythm section of guitar, piano, double bass, and drums.<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{cite book|last1=Gioia|first1=Ted|title=The History of Jazz|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539970-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/100 100\u2014]|edition=2|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/100}}</ref><ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|title=Big Band Music Genre Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/big-band-ma0000002461|website=AllMusic|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref> The division in early big bands was likely to be two or three trumpets, one or two trombones, three saxophones, and a rhythm section.<ref name=\"Collier\">{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=James|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries|location=New York| isbn=1-56159-284-6| page=122| volume=1| edition=2nd}}</ref> In 1930, big bands usually consisted of three trumpets, three trombones, three saxophones, and a rhythm section of four instruments. Guitar replaced the [[banjo]], and double bass replaced the [[tuba]]. In the 1940s, [[Stan Kenton]]'s band and [[Woody Herman]]'s band used up to five trumpets, four trombones (three [[Tenor trombone|tenor]], one [[bass trombone]]), five saxophones (two [[alto saxophone]]s, two [[tenor saxophone]]s, one [[baritone saxophone]]), and a rhythm section. An exception is Duke Ellington, who at one time used six trumpets. [[Boyd Raeburn]] drew from [[symphony orchestra]]s by adding to his band flute, [[French horn]], violin, and [[timpani]].<ref name=\"Collier\" />\n\n==Arrangements==\n[[Image:OckbrookBandPridePark.jpg|thumb|Ockbrook Big Band at [[Pride Park Stadium]]]]\nTypical big band [[Head arrangement|arrangements]] are written in [[strophic form]] with the same phrase and chord structure repeated several times. Each iteration, or chorus, commonly follows [[twelve bar blues]] form or [[Thirty-two-bar form|thirty-two-bar (AABA) song form]]. The first chorus of an arrangement introduces the melody and is followed by choruses of development. This development may take the form of improvised solos, written solo sections, and \"[[shout chorus]]es\".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAn arrangement's first chorus is sometimes preceded by an introduction, which may be as short as a few measures or may extend to chorus of its own. Many arrangements contain an interlude, often similar in content to the introduction, inserted between some or all choruses. Other methods of embellishing the form include modulations and cadential extensions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome big ensembles, like [[King Oliver]]'s, played music that was half-arranged, half-improvised, often relying on head arrangements. A head arrangement is a piece of music that is formed by band members during rehearsal. They experiment, then memorize the way they are going to perform the piece, without writing it on sheet music. During the 1930s, [[Count Basie]]'s band often used head arrangements, as Basie said, \"we just sort of start it off and the others fall in.\"<ref name=\"Kernfeld\">{{cite book|last1=Kernfeld|first1=Barry|title=What to Listen to in Jazz|date=1995|publisher=Yale Univ.

As jazz migrated from its New Orleans origin to Chicago and New York City, energetic, suggestive dances traveled with it. During the next decades, ballrooms filled with people doing the [[jitterbug]] and [[Lindy Hop]]. The dance duo [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] popularized the [[foxtrot]] while accompanied by the Europe Society Orchestra led by [[James Reese Europe]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\nOne of the first bands to accompany the new rhythms was led by a drummer, [[Art Hickman]], in San Francisco in 1916. Hickman's arranger, [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]], wrote [[Head arrangement|arrangements]] in which he divided the jazz orchestra into sections that combined in various ways. This intermingling of sections became a defining characteristic of big bands. In 1919, [[Paul Whiteman]] hired Grof\u00e9 to use similar techniques for his band. Whiteman was educated in classical music, and he called his new band's music symphonic jazz. The methods of dance bands marked a step away from New Orleans jazz. With the exception of [[Jelly Roll Morton]], who continued playing in the New Orleans style, bandleaders paid attention to the demand for dance music and created their own big bands.<ref name=\"Collier\" /> They incorporated elements of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[ragtime]], and [[vaudeville]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\n[[Duke Ellington]] led his band at the [[Cotton Club]] in Harlem. [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s career started when he was persuaded to audition for a job at Club Alabam in New York City, which eventually turned into a job as bandleader at the [[Roseland Ballroom]]. At these venues, which themselves gained notoriety, bandleaders and arrangers played a greater role than they had before. Hickman relied on Ferde Grof\u00e9, Whiteman on [[Bill Challis]]. Henderson and arranger [[Don Redman]] followed the template of [[King Oliver]], but as the 1920s progressed they moved away from the New Orleans format and transformed jazz. They were assisted by a band full of talent: [[Coleman Hawkins]] on tenor saxophone, [[Louis Armstrong]] on cornet, and multi-instrumentalist [[Benny Carter]], whose career lasted into the 1990s.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\n===The swing era===\n[[Image:BennyGoodmanandBandStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Benny Goodman]] and [[Peggy Lee]]]]\n[[Swing music]] began appearing in the early 1930s and was distinguished by a more supple feel than the more literal [[4/4 time|{{music|time|4|4}}]] of early jazz. [[Walter Page]] is often credited with developing the [[walking bass]], though earlier examples exist, such as [[Wellman Braud]] on Ellington's ''Washington Wabble'' from 1927.\n\nThis type of music flourished through the early 1930s, although there was little mass audience for it until around 1936. Up until that time, it was viewed with ridicule and looked upon as a curiosity. After 1935, big bands rose to prominence playing swing music and held a major role in defining swing as a distinctive style. [[Western swing]] musicians also formed popular big bands during the same period.\n\nThere was a considerable range of styles among the hundreds of popular bands. Many of the better known bands reflected the individuality of the bandleader, the lead arranger, and the personnel. Count Basie played a relaxed, propulsive swing, [[Bob Crosby]] more of a dixieland style, [[Benny Goodman]] a hard driving swing, and Duke Ellington's compositions were varied and sophisticated. Many bands featured strong instrumentalists whose sounds dominated, such as the clarinets of Benny Goodman and [[Artie Shaw]], the trombone of [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpet of [[Harry James]], the drums of [[Gene Krupa]], and the vibes of [[Lionel Hampton]]. The popularity of many of the major bands was amplified by star vocalists, such as [[Frank Sinatra]] with [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Helen O'Connell]] and [[Bob Eberly]] with [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]] with [[Chick Webb]], [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Jimmy Rushing]] with [[Count Basie]], [[Dick Haymes]] and [[Helen Forrest]] with [[Harry James]], [[Doris Day]] with [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], and [[Peggy Lee]] with Benny Goodman. Some bands were \"society bands\" which relied on strong ensembles but little on soloists or vocalists, such as the bands of [[Guy Lombardo]] and Paul Whiteman.\n\nBy this time the Big Band was such a dominant force in jazz that the older generation found they either had to adapt to it or simply retire. With no market for small-group recordings (made worse by a Depression-era industry reluctant to take risks), musicians such as Louis Armstrong and [[Earl Hines]] led their own bands, while others, like Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, lapsed into obscurity.\n\nThe major \"black\" bands of the 1930s included, apart from Ellington's, Hines's and Calloway's, those of [[Jimmie Lunceford]], [[Chick Webb]], and Count Basie. The \"white\" bands of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, [[Shep Fields]] and, later, Glenn Miller were more popular than their \"black\" counterparts from the middle of the decade. Bridging the gap to white audiences in the mid-1930s was the [[Casa Loma Orchestra]] and Benny Goodman's early band.\n\n[[Image:Glen miller.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Glenn Miller]], a major in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, led a 50-piece military band that specialized in Swing music]]\nWhite teenagers and young adults were the principal fans of the Big Bands in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They danced to recordings and the radio and attended live concerts. They were knowledgeable and often biased toward their favorite bands and songs, and sometimes worshipful of famous soloists and vocalists. Many bands toured the country in grueling one-night stands. Traveling conditions and lodging were difficult, in part due to segregation in most parts of the United States, and the personnel often had to perform having had little sleep and food. Apart from the star soloists, many musicians received low wages and would abandon the tour if bookings disappeared. Personal problems and band discord affected the group. Drinking and addiction were common. Turnover was frequent, and top soloists were lured by more lucrative contracts. Sometimes bandstands were too small, public address systems inadequate, pianos out of tune. Bandleaders dealt with these obstacles through rigid discipline (Glenn Miller) and canny psychology ([[Duke Ellington]]). [[Image:Grand Central Big Band.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Central Big Band.]] \n\nBig Bands uplifted morale during [[World War II]]. Many musicians served in the military and toured with [[USO]] troupes at the front, with Glenn Miller losing his life while traveling between shows. Many bands suffered from the loss of personnel and quality declined at home during the war years. The [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike]] worsened the situation. Vocalists began to strike out on their own. By the end of the war, swing was giving way to less danceable music, such as [[bebop]]. Many of the great swing bands broke up, as the times and tastes changed.\n\n===Modern big bands===\nAlthough big bands are identified with the swing era, they continued to exist after those decades, though the music they played was often different from swing. Bandleader [[Charlie Barnet]]'s recording of \"[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]\" in 1942 and \"The Moose\" in 1943 have been called the beginning of the bop era. [[Woody Herman]]'s first band, nicknamed the First Herd, borrowed from progressive jazz, while the Second Herd emphasized the saxophone section of three tenors and one baritone. In the 1950s, [[Stan Kenton]] referred to his band's music as \"progressive jazz\", \"modern\", and \"new music\". He created his band as a vehicle for his compositions. Kenton pushed the boundaries of big bands by combining clashing elements and by hiring arrangers whose ideas about music conflicted. This expansive eclecticism characterized much of jazz after World War II. During the 1960s and '70s, [[Sun Ra]] and his Arketstra took big bands further out. Ra's eclectic music was played by a roster of musicians from ten to thirty and was presented as theater, with costumes, dancers, and special effects.<ref name=\"Gioia\" /> \n\nAs jazz was expanded during the 1950s through the 1970s, the Basie and Ellington bands were still around, as were bands led by [[Buddy Rich]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Clark Terry]], and [[Doc Severinsen]]. Progressive bands were led by [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Carla Bley]], [[Toshiko Akiyoshi \u2013 Lew Tabackin Big Band|Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin]], [[Don Ellis]], and [[Anthony Braxton]].\n\nOther bandleaders used [[Brazilian jazz|Brazilian]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz|Afro-Cuban]] music with big band instrumentation, and big bands led by arranger Gil Evans, saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] (on the album ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'' from 1965) and bass guitarist [[Jaco Pastorius]] introduced [[cool jazz]], [[free jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], respectively, to the big band domain. Modern big bands can be found playing all styles of jazz music. Some large contemporary European jazz ensembles play mostly [[avant-garde jazz]] using the instrumentation of the big bands. Examples include the [[Vienna Art Orchestra]], founded in 1977, and the [[Italian Instabile Orchestra]], active in the 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1990s, there was a [[swing revival]] in the U.S. The Lindy Hop became popular again and young people took an interest in big band styles again.\n\nBig bands maintained a presence on American television, particularly through the late-night talk show, which has historically used big bands as [[house band|house accompaniment]]. Typically the most prominent shows with the earliest time slots and largest audiences have bigger bands with horn sections while those in later time slots go with smaller, leaner ensembles.\n\n==Radio==\nDuring the 1930s, [[Earl Hines]] and his band broadcast from [[Sunset Cafe|the Grand Terrace]] in Chicago every night across America.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite web|last1=Travis|first1=Dempsey J.|title=Where The Jazz Was Super-hot| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-03-26/news/8501170148_1_dance-floor-radio-band|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate=6 September 2017|language=en|date=26 March 1985}}</ref> In Kansas City and across the Southwest, an earthier, bluesier style was developed by such bandleaders as [[Bennie Moten]] and, later, by [[Jay McShann]] and [[Jesse Stone]].

TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications use basic [[set theory]] to define safety (bad things won't happen) and [[temporal logic]] to define liveness (good things eventually happen).\n\nTLA<sup>+</sup> is also used to write [[Automated theorem proving|machine-checked proofs of correctness]] both for [[algorithms]] and mathematical theorems. The proofs are written in a declarative, hierarchical style independent of any single theorem prover backend.

The pseudocode-like language [[PlusCal]] was created in 2009; it [[Source-to-source compiler|transpiles]] to TLA<sup>+</sup> and is useful for specifying sequential algorithms.

His hair is short and balding, and he is wearing glasses with a dress shirt and jacket.|[[Amir Pnueli]] applied temporal logic to computer science, for which he received the 1996 [[Turing award]].]]\nModern [[temporal logic]] was developed by [[Arthur Prior]] in 1957, then called tense logic. Although [[Amir Pnueli]] was the first to seriously study the applications of temporal logic to [[computer science]], Prior speculated on its use a decade earlier in 1967:\n\n{{quote|The usefulness of systems of this sort [on discrete time] does not depend on any serious metaphysical assumption that time is discrete; they are applicable in limited fields of discourse in which we are concerned only with what happens next in a sequence of discrete states, e.g. in the working of a digital computer.}}\n\nPnueli researched the use of temporal logic in specifying and reasoning about computer programs, introducing [[linear temporal logic]] in 1977. LTL became an important tool for analysis of concurrent programs, easily expressing properties such as [[mutual exclusion]] and freedom from [[deadlock]].<ref name=\"temporal-logic-history\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m\n | first1 = Peter\n | last2 = Hasle\n | first2 = Per\n | series = Studies in Linguistics and Philosophy\n | volume = 57\n | title = Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence\n | chapter = 3.7 Temporal Logic and Computer Science\n | pages = 344\u2013365\n | publisher = [[Springer Netherlands]]\n | date = 1995\n | doi = 10.1007/978-0-585-37463-5| isbn = 978-0-7923-3586-3\n }}\n</ref>\n\nConcurrent with Pnueli's work on LTL, academics were working to generalize [[Hoare logic]] for verification of multiprocess programs. [[Leslie Lamport]] became interested in the problem after [[peer review]] found an error in a paper he submitted on mutual exclusion. Ed Ashcroft introduced [[Invariant (computer science)|invariance]] in his 1975 paper \"Proving Assertions About Parallel Programs\", which Lamport used to generalize [[Robert W. Floyd|Floyd]]'s method in his 1977 paper \"Proving Correctness of Multiprocess Programs\". Lamport's paper also introduced [[Safety (distributed computing)|safety]] and [[liveness]] as generalizations of [[partial correctness]] and [[Divergence (computer science)|termination]], respectively.<ref name=\"lamport-proving\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#proving\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref> This method was used to verify the first concurrent [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] algorithm in a 1978 paper with [[Edsger Dijkstra]].<ref name=\"lamport-garbage\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: On-the-fly Garbage Collection: an Exercise in Cooperation\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#garbage\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref>\n\nLamport first encountered Pnueli's LTL during a 1978 seminar at [[Stanford]] organized by [[Susan Owicki]]. According to Lamport, \"I was sure that temporal logic was some kind of abstract nonsense that would never have any practical application, but it seemed like fun, so I attended.\" In 1980 he published \"'Sometime' is Sometimes 'Not Never'\", which became one of the most frequently-cited papers in the temporal logic literature.<ref name=\"lamport-sometime\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: 'Sometime' is Sometimes 'Not Never'\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#sometime\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref> Lamport worked on writing temporal logic specifications during his time at [[SRI International|SRI]], but found the approach to be impractical:\n\n[[File:Leslie Lamport.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a Caucasian man in his seventies with medium-length gray hair and a full gray beard, wearing glasses and a T-shirt.|TLA<sup>+</sup> was developed by computer scientist and 2013 Turing award recipient [[Leslie Lamport]].]]\n\n{{quote|However, I became disillusioned with temporal logic when I saw how Schwartz, Melliar-Smith, and Fritz Vogt were spending days trying to specify a simple [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO queue]]&nbsp;\u2013 arguing over whether the properties they listed were sufficient. I realized that, despite its aesthetic appeal, writing a specification as a conjunction of temporal properties just didn't work in practice.}}\n\nHis search for a practical method of specification resulted in the 1983 paper \"Specifying Concurrent Programming Modules\", which introduced the idea of describing state transitions as boolean-valued functions of primed and unprimed variables.<ref name=\"lamport-spec\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: Specifying Concurrent Programming Modules\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#spec\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref> Work continued throughout the 1980s, and Lamport began publishing papers on the [[temporal logic of actions]] in 1990; however, it was not formally introduced until \"The Temporal Logic of Actions\" was published in 1994. TLA enabled the use of [[Action language|actions]] in temporal formulas, which according to Lamport \"provides an elegant way to formalize and systematize all the reasoning used in concurrent system verification.\"<ref name=\"lamport-actions\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: The Temporal Logic of Actions\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-actions\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref>\n\nTLA specifications mostly consisted of ordinary non-temporal mathematics, which Lamport found less cumbersome than a purely temporal specification.

The incomplete work is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html available] from his official website. Lamport is also creating [http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html The TLA+ Video Course], described therein as \"a work in progress that consists of the beginning of a series of video lectures to teach programmers and software engineers how to write their own TLA+ specifications\".\n\n==Language==\nTLA<sup>+</sup> specifications are organized into modules. Modules can extend (import) other modules to use their functionality. Although the TLA<sup>+</sup> standard is specified in typeset mathematical symbols, existing TLA<sup>+</sup> tools use [[LaTeX]]-like symbol definitions in [[ASCII]]. TLA<sup>+</sup> uses several terms which require definition:\n* ''State'' \u2013 an assignment of values to variables\n* ''Behaviour'' \u2013 a sequence of states\n* ''Step'' \u2013 a pair of successive states in a behavior\n* ''Stuttering step'' \u2013 a step during which variables are unchanged\n* ''Next-state relation'' \u2013 a relation describing how variables can change in any step\n* ''State function'' \u2013 an expression containing variables and constants that is not a next-state relation\n* ''State predicate'' \u2013 a Boolean-valued state function\n* ''Invariant'' \u2013 a state predicate true in all reachable states\n* ''Temporal formula'' \u2013 an expression containing statements in temporal logic\n\n===Safety===\nTLA<sup>+</sup> concerns itself with defining the set of all correct system behaviours. For example, a one-bit clock ticking endlessly between 0 and 1 could be specified as follows:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nVARIABLE clock\n\nInit == clock \\in {0, 1}\n\nTick == IF clock = 0 THEN clock' = 1 ELSE clock' = 0\n\nSpec == Init /\\ [][Tick]_<<clock>>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe next-state relation '''Tick''' sets ''clock''\u2032 (the value of ''clock'' in the next state) to 1 if ''clock'' is 0, and 0 if ''clock'' is 1. The state predicate '''Init''' is true if the value of ''clock'' is either 0 or 1. '''Spec''' is a temporal formula asserting all behaviours of one-bit clock must initially satisfy '''Init''' and have all steps either match '''Tick''' or be stuttering steps. Two such behaviours are:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\n0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> ...\n\n1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> ...\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe safety properties of the one-bit clock&nbsp;\u2013 the set of reachable system states&nbsp;\u2013 are adequately described by the spec.\n\n===Liveness===\nThe above spec disallows strange states for the one-bit clock, but does not say the clock will ever tick. For example, the following perpetually-stuttering behaviours are accepted:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\n0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> ...\n\n1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ...\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA clock which does not tick is not useful, so these behaviours should be disallowed. One solution is to disable stuttering, but TLA<sup>+</sup> requires stuttering always be enabled; a stuttering step represents a change to some part of the system not described in the spec, and is useful for [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]]. To ensure the clock must eventually tick, weak [[Unbounded nondeterminism#Fairness|fairness]] is asserted for '''Tick''':\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nSpec == Init /\\ [][Tick]_<<clock>> /\\ WF_<<clock>>(Tick)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWeak fairness over an action means if that action is continuously enabled, it must eventually be taken. With weak fairness on '''Tick''' only a finite number of stuttering steps are permitted between ticks. This temporal logical statement about '''Tick''' is called a liveness assertion. In general, a liveness assertion should be ''machine-closed'': it shouldn't constrain the set of reachable states, only the set of possible behaviours.<ref name=\"machine-closure\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = Specifying Systems: The TLA<sup>+</sup> Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers\n | chapter = 8.9.2 Machine Closure\n | page = 112\n | quote = We seldom want to write a specification that isn't machine closed.

The language includes set [[Element (mathematics)|membership]], [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[Relative complement|difference]], [[powerset]], and [[subset]] operators. [[First-order logic]] operators such as {{math|&or;}}, {{math|&and;}}, {{math|&not;}}, {{math|&rArr;}}, {{math|&harr;}}, {{math|&equiv;}} are also included, as well as [[universal quantification|universal]] and [[existential quantification|existential]] quantifiers {{math|&forall;}} and {{math|&exist;}}. [[Epsilon calculus|Hilbert's {{math|&epsilon;}}]] is provided as the CHOOSE operator, which uniquely selects an arbitrary set element. Arithmetic operators over [[real number|reals]], [[integers]], and [[natural numbers]] are available from the standard modules.\n\nTemporal logic operators are built into TLA<sup>+</sup>. Temporal formulas use <math>\\Box P</math> to mean ''P'' is always true, and <math>\\Diamond P</math> to mean ''P'' is eventually true. The operators are combined into <math>\\Box \\Diamond P</math> to mean ''P'' is true infinitely often, or <math>\\Diamond \\Box P</math> to mean eventually ''P'' will always be true. Other temporal operators include weak and strong fairness. Weak fairness WF<sub>e</sub>(''A'') means if action ''A'' is enabled ''continuously'' (i.e. without interruptions), it must eventually be taken. Strong fairness SF<sub>e</sub>(''A'') means if action ''A'' is enabled ''continually'' (repeatedly, with or without interruptions), it must eventually be taken.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Temporal existential and universal quantification are included in TLA<sup>+</sup>, although without support from the tools.\n\nUser-defined operators are similar to [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Operators differ from functions in that their domain need not be a set: for example, the [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] operator has the [[category of sets]] as its domain, which is [[set of all sets|not a valid set]] in ZFC (since its existence leads to [[Russell's paradox]]). Recursive and anonymous user-defined operators were added in TLA<sup>+2</sup>.\n\n===Data structures===\nThe foundational data structure of TLA<sup>+</sup> is the set. Sets are either explicitly enumerated or constructed from other sets using operators or with <source lang=\"tex\" inline>{x \\in S : p}</source> where ''p'' is some condition on ''x'', or <source lang=\"tex\" inline>{e : x \\in S}</source> where ''e'' is some function of ''x''. The unique [[empty set]] is represented as <code>{}</code>.\n\n[[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] in TLA<sup>+</sup> assign a value to each element in their domain, a set. <code>[S -> T]</code> is the set of all functions with f[''x''] in ''T'', for each ''x'' in the [[Domain of a function|domain]] set ''S''. For example, the TLA<sup>+</sup> function <code>Double[x \\in Nat] == x*2</code> is an element of the set <code>[Nat -> Nat]</code> so <code>Double \\in [Nat -> Nat]</code> is a true statement in TLA<sup>+</sup>. Functions are also defined with <code>[x \\in S |-> e]</code> for some expression ''e'', or by modifying an existing function <code>[f EXCEPT ![v<sub>1</sub>] = v<sub>2</sub>]</code>.\n\n[[Record (computer science)|Records]] are a type of function in TLA<sup>+</sup>. The record <code>[name |-> \"John\", age |-> 35]</code> is a record with fields name and age, accessed with <code>r.name</code> and <code>r.age</code>, and belonging to the set of records <code>[name : String, age : Nat]</code>.\n\n[[Tuples]] are included in TLA<sup>+</sup>. They are explicitly defined with <code><<e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>3</sub>>></code> or constructed with operators from the standard Sequences module. Sets of tuples are defined by [[Cartesian product]]; for example, the set of all pairs of natural numbers is defined <code>Nat \\X Nat</code>.\n\n==Standard modules==\nTLA<sup>+</sup> has a set of standard modules containing common operators. They are distributed with the syntactic analyzer. The TLC model checker uses Java implementations for improved performance.\n\n* '''FiniteSets''': Module for working with [[finite sets]]. Provides ''IsFiniteSet(S)'' and ''Cardinality(S)'' operators.\n* '''Sequences''': Defines operators on [[tuples]] such as ''Len(S)'', ''Head(S)'', ''Tail(S)'', ''Append(S, E)'', [[concatenation]], and [[Filter (higher-order function)|filter]].\n* '''Bags''': Module for working with [[multisets]]. Provides primitive set operation analogues and duplicate counting.\n* '''Naturals''': Defines the [[Natural numbers]] along with inequality and arithmetic operators.\n* '''Integers''': Defines the [[Integers]].\n* '''Reals''': Defines the [[Real numbers]] along with division and [[infinity]].\n* '''RealTime''': Provides definitions useful in [[real-time system]] specifications.\n* '''TLC''': Provides utility functions for model-checked specifications, such as logging and assertions.\n\nStandard modules are imported with the <code>EXTENDS</code> or <code>INSTANCE</code> statements.\n\n==Tools==\n\n===IDE===\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = TLA+ Toolbox\n| title                  = TLA+ Toolbox\n| logo                   = \n| screenshot             = TLA IDE screenshot.png\n| caption                = TLA<sup>+</sup> IDE in typical use showing spec explorer on the left, editor in the middle, and parse errors on the right.\n| author                 = Simon Zambrovski, Markus Kuppe, Daniel Ricketts\n| developer              = [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Microsoft]]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|2010|02|04}}<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 1.6.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2019|07|11}}<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = 1.6.1\n| latest preview date    = {{Start date and age|2020|04|02}}\n| repo                   = {{URL|https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus}}\n| programming language   = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\n| operating system       = \n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = English\n| language count         = <!-- DO NOT include this parameter unless you know what it does -->\n| language footnote      = \n| genre                  = [[Integrated development environment]]\n| license                = [[MIT License]]\n| website                = {{URL|http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html}}\n}}\nAn [[integrated development environment]] is implemented on top of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].

TLC generates a set of initial states satisfying the spec, then performs a [[breadth-first search]] over all defined state transitions. Execution stops when all state transitions lead to states which have already been discovered. If TLC discovers a state which violates a system invariant, it halts and provides a state trace path to the offending state. TLC provides a method of declaring model symmetries to defend against [[combinatorial explosion]].<ref name=\"tlcoriginal\"/> It also [[parallel computing|parallelizes]] the state exploration step, and can run in distributed mode to spread the workload across a large number of computers.<ref name=\"tlcdistributed\">\n{{cite AV media\n | people = Markus A.

TLC operates on a subset of TLA<sup>+</sup>; the model must be finite and enumerable, and some temporal operators are not supported. In distributed mode TLC cannot check liveness properties, nor check random or depth-first behaviours. TLC is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tlc.html available] as a command line tool or bundled with the TLA toolbox.\n\n===Proof system===\nThe TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System, or TLAPS, [[Automated theorem proving|mechanically checks]] proofs written in TLA<sup>+</sup>. It was developed at the [[Microsoft Research]]-[[INRIA]] Joint Centre to prove correctness of concurrent and distributed algorithms. The proof language is designed to be independent of any particular theorem prover; proofs are written in a declarative style, and transformed into individual obligations which are sent to back-end provers. The primary back-end provers are [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]] and Zenon, with fallback to [[Satisfiability modulo theories|SMT]] solvers [[CVC3]], [[Yices]], and [[Z3 Theorem Prover|Z3]]. TLAPS proofs are hierarchically structured, easing refactoring and enabling non-linear development: work can begin on later steps before all prior steps are verified, and difficult steps are decomposed into smaller sub-steps. TLAPS works well with TLC, as the model checker quickly finds small errors before verification is begun. In turn, TLAPS can prove system properties which are beyond the capabilities of finite model checking.<ref name=\"tlaps-survey\"/>\n\nTLAPS does not currently support reasoning with real numbers, nor most temporal operators. Isabelle and Zenon generally cannot prove arithmetic proof obligations, requiring use of the SMT solvers.<ref name=\"tlaps-unsupported\">\n{{cite web\n | title = Unsupported TLAPS features\n | website = TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System\n | publisher = [[Microsoft Research]] - [[INRIA]] Joint Centre\n | url = https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Documentation/Unsupported_features.html\n | accessdate = 14 May 2015}}\n</ref> TLAPS has been used to prove correctness of [[Paxos (computer science)#Byzantine Paxos|Byzantine Paxos]], the Memoir security architecture, and components of the [[Pastry (DHT)|Pastry distributed hash table]].<ref name=\"tlaps-survey\"/> It is distributed separately from the rest of the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools and is free software, distributed under the [[BSD license]].<ref>[https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html TLA+ Proof System]</ref> TLA<sup>+2</sup> greatly expanded language support for proof constructs.\n\n==Industry use==\nAt [[Microsoft]], a critical bug was discovered in the [[Xbox 360]] memory module during the process of writing a specification in TLA<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=\"lamportbuild\">\n{{cite AV media\n | people = [[Leslie Lamport]]\n | title = Thinking for Programmers (at 21m46s)\n | medium = Recording of technical talk\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n | location = San Francisco\n | date = 3 April 2014\n | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-642#time=21m46s\n | accessdate = 14 May 2015}}\n</ref> TLA<sup>+</sup> was used to write formal proofs of correctness for [[Paxos (computer science)#Byzantine Paxos|Byzantine Paxos]] and components of the [[Pastry (DHT)|Pastry distributed hash table]].<ref name=\"tlaps-survey\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Cousineau\n | first1 = Denis\n | last2 = Doligez\n | first2 = Damien\n | last3 = Lamport\n | first3 = Leslie\n | authorlink3 = Leslie Lamport\n | last4 = Merz\n | first4 = Stephan\n | last5 = Ricketts\n | first5 = Daniel\n | last6 = Vanzetto\n | first6 = Hern\u00e1n\n | title = TLA<sup>+</sup> Proofs\n | publisher = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]\n | journal = FM 2012: Formal Methods\n | volume = 7436\n | pages = 147\u2013154\n | date = 1 January 2012\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_14\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/tlaps.pdf\n | accessdate = 14 May 2015| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n | isbn = 978-3-642-32758-2\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[Amazon Web Services]] has used TLA<sup>+</sup> since 2011.

developed by [[Leslie Lamport]]. It is used to design, model, document, and verify programs, especially [[concurrent systems]] and [[distributed systems]]. TLA<sup>+</sup> has been described as exhaustively-testable [[pseudocode]],<ref name=\"awsorig\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Newcombe\n | first = Chris\n | last2 = Rath\n | first2 = Tim\n | last3 = Zhang\n | first3 = Fan\n | last4 = Munteanu\n | first4 = Bogdan\n | last5 = Brooker\n | first5 = Marc\n | last6 = Deardeuff\n | first6 = Michael\n | title = Use of Formal Methods at Amazon Web Services\n | publisher = [[Amazon Web Services|Amazon]]\n | date = 29 September 2014\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf\n | accessdate = 8 May 2015}}\n</ref> and its use likened to [[Technical drawing|drawing blueprints]] for software systems;<ref name=\"wired\">\n{{cite journal\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = Why We Should Build Software Like We Build Houses\n | journal = Wired\n | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]\n | date = 25 January 2013\n | url = https://www.wired.com/2013/01/code-bugs-programming-why-we-need-specs/\n | accessdate = 7 May 2015}}\n</ref> ''TLA'' is an [[acronym]] for [[Temporal Logic of Actions]].\n\nFor design and documentation, TLA<sup>+</sup> fulfills the same purpose as informal [[technical specifications]]. However, TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications are written in a formal language of [[logic]] and mathematics, and the precision of specifications written in this language is intended to uncover design flaws before system implementation is underway.<ref name=\"precise-spec\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = Specifying Systems: The TLA<sup>+</sup> Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers\n | chapter = 7.1 Why Specify\n | page = 75\n | quote = Having to describe a design precisely often reveals problems - subtle interactions and \"corner cases\" that are easily overlooked.\n | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]\n | date = 18 June 2002\n | chapter-url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html\n | isbn = 978-0-321-14306-8}}\n</ref>\n\nSince TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications are written in a formal language, they are amenable to finite [[model checking]]. The model checker finds all possible system behaviours up to some number of execution steps, and examines them for violations of desired [[Invariant (computer science)|invariance]] properties such as [[Safety (distributed computing)|safety]] and [[liveness]]. TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications use basic [[set theory]] to define safety (bad things won't happen) and [[temporal logic]] to define liveness (good things eventually happen).\n\nTLA<sup>+</sup> is also used to write [[Automated theorem proving|machine-checked proofs of correctness]] both for [[algorithms]] and mathematical theorems. The proofs are written in a declarative, hierarchical style independent of any single theorem prover backend. Both formal and informal structured mathematical proofs can be written in TLA<sup>+</sup>; the language is similar to [[LaTeX]], and tools exist to translate TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications to LaTeX documents.<ref name=\"lamport-proofs\">\n{{cite journal\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = How to Write a 21st Century Proof\n | journal = Journal of Fixed Point Theory and Applications\n | volume = 11\n | pages = 43\u201363\n | date = 2012\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/proof.pdf\n | issn = 1661-7738\n | doi = 10.1007/s11784-012-0071-6\n | accessdate = 23 May 2015}}\n</ref>\n\nTLA<sup>+</sup> was introduced in 1999, following several decades of research into a verification method for concurrent systems. A toolchain has since developed, including an [[interactive development environment|IDE]] and distributed model checker. The pseudocode-like language [[PlusCal]] was created in 2009; it [[Source-to-source compiler|transpiles]] to TLA<sup>+</sup> and is useful for specifying sequential algorithms. TLA<sup>+2</sup> was announced in 2014, expanding language support for proof constructs.

His hair is short and balding, and he is wearing glasses with a dress shirt and jacket.|[[Amir Pnueli]] applied temporal logic to computer science, for which he received the 1996 [[Turing award]].]]\nModern [[temporal logic]] was developed by [[Arthur Prior]] in 1957, then called tense logic. Although [[Amir Pnueli]] was the first to seriously study the applications of temporal logic to [[computer science]], Prior speculated on its use a decade earlier in 1967:\n\n{{quote|The usefulness of systems of this sort [on discrete time] does not depend on any serious metaphysical assumption that time is discrete; they are applicable in limited fields of discourse in which we are concerned only with what happens next in a sequence of discrete states, e.g. in the working of a digital computer.}}\n\nPnueli researched the use of temporal logic in specifying and reasoning about computer programs, introducing [[linear temporal logic]] in 1977. LTL became an important tool for analysis of concurrent programs, easily expressing properties such as [[mutual exclusion]] and freedom from [[deadlock]].<ref name=\"temporal-logic-history\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m\n | first1 = Peter\n | last2 = Hasle\n | first2 = Per\n | series = Studies in Linguistics and Philosophy\n | volume = 57\n | title = Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence\n | chapter = 3.7 Temporal Logic and Computer Science\n | pages = 344\u2013365\n | publisher = [[Springer Netherlands]]\n | date = 1995\n | doi = 10.1007/978-0-585-37463-5| isbn = 978-0-7923-3586-3\n }}\n</ref>\n\nConcurrent with Pnueli's work on LTL, academics were working to generalize [[Hoare logic]] for verification of multiprocess programs. [[Leslie Lamport]] became interested in the problem after [[peer review]] found an error in a paper he submitted on mutual exclusion. Ed Ashcroft introduced [[Invariant (computer science)|invariance]] in his 1975 paper \"Proving Assertions About Parallel Programs\", which Lamport used to generalize [[Robert W. Floyd|Floyd]]'s method in his 1977 paper \"Proving Correctness of Multiprocess Programs\". Lamport's paper also introduced [[Safety (distributed computing)|safety]] and [[liveness]] as generalizations of [[partial correctness]] and [[Divergence (computer science)|termination]], respectively.<ref name=\"lamport-proving\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#proving\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref> This method was used to verify the first concurrent [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] algorithm in a 1978 paper with [[Edsger Dijkstra]].<ref name=\"lamport-garbage\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: On-the-fly Garbage Collection: an Exercise in Cooperation\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#garbage\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref>\n\nLamport first encountered Pnueli's LTL during a 1978 seminar at [[Stanford]] organized by [[Susan Owicki]]. According to Lamport, \"I was sure that temporal logic was some kind of abstract nonsense that would never have any practical application, but it seemed like fun, so I attended.\" In 1980 he published \"'Sometime' is Sometimes 'Not Never'\", which became one of the most frequently-cited papers in the temporal logic literature.<ref name=\"lamport-sometime\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: 'Sometime' is Sometimes 'Not Never'\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#sometime\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref> Lamport worked on writing temporal logic specifications during his time at [[SRI International|SRI]], but found the approach to be impractical:\n\n[[File:Leslie Lamport.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a Caucasian man in his seventies with medium-length gray hair and a full gray beard, wearing glasses and a T-shirt.|TLA<sup>+</sup> was developed by computer scientist and 2013 Turing award recipient [[Leslie Lamport]].]]\n\n{{quote|However, I became disillusioned with temporal logic when I saw how Schwartz, Melliar-Smith, and Fritz Vogt were spending days trying to specify a simple [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO queue]]&nbsp;\u2013 arguing over whether the properties they listed were sufficient. I realized that, despite its aesthetic appeal, writing a specification as a conjunction of temporal properties just didn't work in practice.}}\n\nHis search for a practical method of specification resulted in the 1983 paper \"Specifying Concurrent Programming Modules\", which introduced the idea of describing state transitions as boolean-valued functions of primed and unprimed variables.<ref name=\"lamport-spec\">\n{{cite web\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: Specifying Concurrent Programming Modules\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#spec\n | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}\n</ref> Work continued throughout the 1980s, and Lamport began publishing papers on the [[temporal logic of actions]] in 1990; however, it was not formally introduced until \"The Temporal Logic of Actions\" was published in 1994.

The incomplete work is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html available] from his official website. Lamport is also creating [http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html The TLA+ Video Course], described therein as \"a work in progress that consists of the beginning of a series of video lectures to teach programmers and software engineers how to write their own TLA+ specifications\".\n\n==Language==\nTLA<sup>+</sup> specifications are organized into modules. Modules can extend (import) other modules to use their functionality. Although the TLA<sup>+</sup> standard is specified in typeset mathematical symbols, existing TLA<sup>+</sup> tools use [[LaTeX]]-like symbol definitions in [[ASCII]]. TLA<sup>+</sup> uses several terms which require definition:\n* ''State'' \u2013 an assignment of values to variables\n* ''Behaviour'' \u2013 a sequence of states\n* ''Step'' \u2013 a pair of successive states in a behavior\n* ''Stuttering step'' \u2013 a step during which variables are unchanged\n* ''Next-state relation'' \u2013 a relation describing how variables can change in any step\n* ''State function'' \u2013 an expression containing variables and constants that is not a next-state relation\n* ''State predicate'' \u2013 a Boolean-valued state function\n* ''Invariant'' \u2013 a state predicate true in all reachable states\n* ''Temporal formula'' \u2013 an expression containing statements in temporal logic\n\n===Safety===\nTLA<sup>+</sup> concerns itself with defining the set of all correct system behaviours. For example, a one-bit clock ticking endlessly between 0 and 1 could be specified as follows:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nVARIABLE clock\n\nInit == clock \\in {0, 1}\n\nTick == IF clock = 0 THEN clock' = 1 ELSE clock' = 0\n\nSpec == Init /\\ [][Tick]_<<clock>>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe next-state relation '''Tick''' sets ''clock''\u2032 (the value of ''clock'' in the next state) to 1 if ''clock'' is 0, and 0 if ''clock'' is 1. The state predicate '''Init''' is true if the value of ''clock'' is either 0 or 1. '''Spec''' is a temporal formula asserting all behaviours of one-bit clock must initially satisfy '''Init''' and have all steps either match '''Tick''' or be stuttering steps. Two such behaviours are:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\n0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> ...\n\n1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> ...\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe safety properties of the one-bit clock&nbsp;\u2013 the set of reachable system states&nbsp;\u2013 are adequately described by the spec.\n\n===Liveness===\nThe above spec disallows strange states for the one-bit clock, but does not say the clock will ever tick. For example, the following perpetually-stuttering behaviours are accepted:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\n0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> ...\n\n1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ...\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA clock which does not tick is not useful, so these behaviours should be disallowed. One solution is to disable stuttering, but TLA<sup>+</sup> requires stuttering always be enabled; a stuttering step represents a change to some part of the system not described in the spec, and is useful for [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]]. To ensure the clock must eventually tick, weak [[Unbounded nondeterminism#Fairness|fairness]] is asserted for '''Tick''':\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nSpec == Init /\\ [][Tick]_<<clock>> /\\ WF_<<clock>>(Tick)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWeak fairness over an action means if that action is continuously enabled, it must eventually be taken. With weak fairness on '''Tick''' only a finite number of stuttering steps are permitted between ticks. This temporal logical statement about '''Tick''' is called a liveness assertion. In general, a liveness assertion should be ''machine-closed'': it shouldn't constrain the set of reachable states, only the set of possible behaviours.<ref name=\"machine-closure\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Lamport\n | first = Leslie\n | authorlink = Leslie Lamport\n | title = Specifying Systems: The TLA<sup>+</sup> Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers\n | chapter = 8.9.2 Machine Closure\n | page = 112\n | quote = We seldom want to write a specification that isn't machine closed.

The language includes set [[Element (mathematics)|membership]], [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[Relative complement|difference]], [[powerset]], and [[subset]] operators. [[First-order logic]] operators such as {{math|&or;}}, {{math|&and;}}, {{math|&not;}}, {{math|&rArr;}}, {{math|&harr;}}, {{math|&equiv;}} are also included, as well as [[universal quantification|universal]] and [[existential quantification|existential]] quantifiers {{math|&forall;}} and {{math|&exist;}}. [[Epsilon calculus|Hilbert's {{math|&epsilon;}}]] is provided as the CHOOSE operator, which uniquely selects an arbitrary set element. Arithmetic operators over [[real number|reals]], [[integers]], and [[natural numbers]] are available from the standard modules.\n\nTemporal logic operators are built into TLA<sup>+</sup>. Temporal formulas use <math>\\Box P</math> to mean ''P'' is always true, and <math>\\Diamond P</math> to mean ''P'' is eventually true. The operators are combined into <math>\\Box \\Diamond P</math> to mean ''P'' is true infinitely often, or <math>\\Diamond \\Box P</math> to mean eventually ''P'' will always be true. Other temporal operators include weak and strong fairness. Weak fairness WF<sub>e</sub>(''A'') means if action ''A'' is enabled ''continuously'' (i.e. without interruptions), it must eventually be taken. Strong fairness SF<sub>e</sub>(''A'') means if action ''A'' is enabled ''continually'' (repeatedly, with or without interruptions), it must eventually be taken.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Temporal existential and universal quantification are included in TLA<sup>+</sup>, although without support from the tools.\n\nUser-defined operators are similar to [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Operators differ from functions in that their domain need not be a set: for example, the [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] operator has the [[category of sets]] as its domain, which is [[set of all sets|not a valid set]] in ZFC (since its existence leads to [[Russell's paradox]]). Recursive and anonymous user-defined operators were added in TLA<sup>+2</sup>.\n\n===Data structures===\nThe foundational data structure of TLA<sup>+</sup> is the set. Sets are either explicitly enumerated or constructed from other sets using operators or with <source lang=\"tex\" inline>{x \\in S : p}</source> where ''p'' is some condition on ''x'', or <source lang=\"tex\" inline>{e : x \\in S}</source> where ''e'' is some function of ''x''. The unique [[empty set]] is represented as <code>{}</code>.\n\n[[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] in TLA<sup>+</sup> assign a value to each element in their domain, a set. <code>[S -> T]</code> is the set of all functions with f[''x''] in ''T'', for each ''x'' in the [[Domain of a function|domain]] set ''S''. For example, the TLA<sup>+</sup> function <code>Double[x \\in Nat] == x*2</code> is an element of the set <code>[Nat -> Nat]</code> so <code>Double \\in [Nat -> Nat]</code> is a true statement in TLA<sup>+</sup>. Functions are also defined with <code>[x \\in S |-> e]</code> for some expression ''e'', or by modifying an existing function <code>[f EXCEPT ![v<sub>1</sub>] = v<sub>2</sub>]</code>.\n\n[[Record (computer science)|Records]] are a type of function in TLA<sup>+</sup>. The record <code>[name |-> \"John\", age |-> 35]</code> is a record with fields name and age, accessed with <code>r.name</code> and <code>r.age</code>, and belonging to the set of records <code>[name : String, age : Nat]</code>.\n\n[[Tuples]] are included in TLA<sup>+</sup>. They are explicitly defined with <code><<e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>3</sub>>></code> or constructed with operators from the standard Sequences module. Sets of tuples are defined by [[Cartesian product]]; for example, the set of all pairs of natural numbers is defined <code>Nat \\X Nat</code>.\n\n==Standard modules==\nTLA<sup>+</sup> has a set of standard modules containing common operators. They are distributed with the syntactic analyzer. The TLC model checker uses Java implementations for improved performance.\n\n* '''FiniteSets''': Module for working with [[finite sets]]. Provides ''IsFiniteSet(S)'' and ''Cardinality(S)'' operators.\n* '''Sequences''': Defines operators on [[tuples]] such as ''Len(S)'', ''Head(S)'', ''Tail(S)'', ''Append(S, E)'', [[concatenation]], and [[Filter (higher-order function)|filter]].\n* '''Bags''': Module for working with [[multisets]]. Provides primitive set operation analogues and duplicate counting.\n* '''Naturals''': Defines the [[Natural numbers]] along with inequality and arithmetic operators.\n* '''Integers''': Defines the [[Integers]].\n* '''Reals''': Defines the [[Real numbers]] along with division and [[infinity]].\n* '''RealTime''': Provides definitions useful in [[real-time system]] specifications.\n* '''TLC''': Provides utility functions for model-checked specifications, such as logging and assertions.\n\nStandard modules are imported with the <code>EXTENDS</code> or <code>INSTANCE</code> statements.\n\n==Tools==\n\n===IDE===\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = TLA+ Toolbox\n| title                  = TLA+ Toolbox\n| logo                   = \n| screenshot             = TLA IDE screenshot.png\n| caption                = TLA<sup>+</sup> IDE in typical use showing spec explorer on the left, editor in the middle, and parse errors on the right.\n| author                 = Simon Zambrovski, Markus Kuppe, Daniel Ricketts\n| developer              = [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Microsoft]]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|2010|02|04}}<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 1.6.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2019|07|11}}<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = \n| repo                   = {{URL|https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus}}\n| programming language   = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\n| operating system       = \n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = English\n| language count         = <!-- DO NOT include this parameter unless you know what it does -->\n| language footnote      = \n| genre                  = [[Integrated development environment]]\n| license                = [[MIT License]]\n| website                = {{URL|http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html}}\n}}\nAn [[integrated development environment]] is implemented on top of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]. It includes an editor with error and [[syntax highlighting]], plus a [[GUI]] front-end to several other TLA<sup>+</sup> tools:\n* The SANY syntactic analyzer, which parses and checks the spec for syntax errors.\n* The [[LaTeX]] translator, to generate [[Prettyprint|pretty-printed]] specs.\n* The PlusCal translator.\n* The TLC model checker.\n* The TLAPS proof system.\nThe IDE is distributed in [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html The TLA Toolbox].\n\n===Model checker===\n[[File:TLC one-bit clock states.png|thumb|alt=Finite state machine diagram of one-bit clock|States and transitions discovered by TLC for the one-bit clock.]]\nThe TLC [[model checker]] builds a [[finite state]] model of TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications for checking [[invariant (computer science)|invariance properties]]. TLC generates a set of initial states satisfying the spec, then performs a [[breadth-first search]] over all defined state transitions. Execution stops when all state transitions lead to states which have already been discovered. If TLC discovers a state which violates a system invariant, it halts and provides a state trace path to the offending state. TLC provides a method of declaring model symmetries to defend against [[combinatorial explosion]].<ref name=\"tlcoriginal\"/> It also [[parallel computing|parallelizes]] the state exploration step, and can run in distributed mode to spread the workload across a large number of computers.<ref name=\"tlcdistributed\">\n{{cite AV media\n | people = Markus A.

TLC operates on a subset of TLA<sup>+</sup>; the model must be finite and enumerable, and some temporal operators are not supported. In distributed mode TLC cannot check liveness properties, nor check random or depth-first behaviours. TLC is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tlc.html available] as a command line tool or bundled with the TLA toolbox.\n\n===Proof system===\nThe TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System, or TLAPS, [[Automated theorem proving|mechanically checks]] proofs written in TLA<sup>+</sup>. It was developed at the [[Microsoft Research]]-[[INRIA]] Joint Centre to prove correctness of concurrent and distributed algorithms. The proof language is designed to be independent of any particular theorem prover; proofs are written in a declarative style, and transformed into individual obligations which are sent to back-end provers. The primary back-end provers are [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]] and Zenon, with fallback to [[Satisfiability modulo theories|SMT]] solvers [[CVC3]], [[Yices]], and [[Z3 Theorem Prover|Z3]]. TLAPS proofs are hierarchically structured, easing refactoring and enabling non-linear development: work can begin on later steps before all prior steps are verified, and difficult steps are decomposed into smaller sub-steps. TLAPS works well with TLC, as the model checker quickly finds small errors before verification is begun. In turn, TLAPS can prove system properties which are beyond the capabilities of finite model checking.<ref name=\"tlaps-survey\"/>\n\nTLAPS does not currently support reasoning with real numbers, nor most temporal operators. Isabelle and Zenon generally cannot prove arithmetic proof obligations, requiring use of the SMT solvers.<ref name=\"tlaps-unsupported\">\n{{cite web\n | title = Unsupported TLAPS features\n | website = TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System\n | publisher = [[Microsoft Research]] - [[INRIA]] Joint Centre\n | url = https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Documentation/Unsupported_features.html\n | accessdate = 14 May 2015}}\n</ref> TLAPS has been used to prove correctness of [[Paxos (computer science)#Byzantine Paxos|Byzantine Paxos]], the Memoir security architecture, and components of the [[Pastry (DHT)|Pastry distributed hash table]].<ref name=\"tlaps-survey\"/> It is distributed separately from the rest of the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools and is free software, distributed under the [[BSD license]].<ref>[https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html TLA+ Proof System]</ref> TLA<sup>+2</sup> greatly expanded language support for proof constructs.\n\n==Industry use==\nAt [[Microsoft]], a critical bug was discovered in the [[Xbox 360]] memory module during the process of writing a specification in TLA<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=\"lamportbuild\">\n{{cite AV media\n | people = [[Leslie Lamport]]\n | title = Thinking for Programmers (at 21m46s)\n | medium = Recording of technical talk\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n | location = San Francisco\n | date = 3 April 2014\n | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-642#time=21m46s\n | accessdate = 14 May 2015}}\n</ref> TLA<sup>+</sup> was used to write formal proofs of correctness for [[Paxos (computer science)#Byzantine Paxos|Byzantine Paxos]] and components of the [[Pastry (DHT)|Pastry distributed hash table]].<ref name=\"tlaps-survey\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Cousineau\n | first1 = Denis\n | last2 = Doligez\n | first2 = Damien\n | last3 = Lamport\n | first3 = Leslie\n | authorlink3 = Leslie Lamport\n | last4 = Merz\n | first4 = Stephan\n | last5 = Ricketts\n | first5 = Daniel\n | last6 = Vanzetto\n | first6 = Hern\u00e1n\n | title = TLA<sup>+</sup> Proofs\n | publisher = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]\n | journal = FM 2012: Formal Methods\n | volume = 7436\n | pages = 147\u2013154\n | date = 1 January 2012\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_14\n | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/tlaps.pdf\n | accessdate = 14 May 2015| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n | isbn = 978-3-642-32758-2\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[Amazon Web Services]] has used TLA<sup>+</sup> since 2011.

[[Rajmata]] Ahilyabai was born in the village of Chondi in [[Jamkhed]], [[Ahmednagar]], Maharashtra. She moved the capital to [[Maheshwar]] south of [[Indore]] on the [[Narmada River]].\n\nAhilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of [[Kumher|Kumbher]] in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], died. A year after that she was crowned as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukojirao Holkar as the Chief of Army.\n\nRani Ahilyabai was a great pioneer and builder of [[Hindu temples]]. She built hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India.\n\n==Early life==\nAhilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day [[Ahmednagar district]] in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the [[Patil (title)|Patil]] of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nHer entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa [[Balaji Baji Rao]] and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723\u20131754). She was married to [[Khanderao Holkar]] in 1733. In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao and in 1748, a daughter Muktabai. Malerao was mentally unwell and died of his illness in 1767.

You may halt there for four or five days. You should keep your big artillery and arrange for its ammunition as much as possible....On the march you should arrange for military posts being located for protection of the road.\"''\n\nAlready trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar's death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar supported her leadership. She led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar [[Tukojirao Holkar]] (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear.\n\nAmong Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also supported the rise of merchants, farmers and cultivators to levels of affluence, and did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to their wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right.\n\nThere are many stories of her care for her people. In one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The Prime Minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh.\n\nAhilyadevi was not able to settle the conflict peacefully in the case of the [[Bhil people|Bhils]] and [[Gondi people|Gonds]], who plundered her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give \"considerate attention to their habits\".\n\nAhilyabai's capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, [[Moropant]] and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar.\n\nAfter her death, she was succeeded by [[Tukojirao Holkar|Tukoji Rao Holkar I]], her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son [[Kashi Rao Holkar]] in 1797.\n\n==Death==\n\nAhilyabai died on 13th August, 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore\u2019s history. Ironically, her daughter became a Sati by jumping into the funeral pyre when her husband, Yashwantrao Phanse, died. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief, Tukoji Rao Holkar I.\n\n==Views about her==\n{{quote farm|date=May 2019}}\n[[File: Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar]]\n\"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years.

She loved to see her people prosper, and to watch the fine cities grow, and to watch that her subjects were not afraid to display their wealth, lest the ruler should snatch it from them. Far and wide the roads were planted with shady trees, and wells were made, and rest-houses for travelers. The poor, the homeless, the orphaned were all helped according to their needs. The Bhils who had long been the torment of all caravans were routed from their mountain fastnesses and persuaded to settle down as honest farmers. Hindu and Musalman alike revered the famous Queen and prayed for her long life. Her last great sorrow was when her daughter became a Sati upon the death of Yashwantrao Phanse.

She moved the capital to [[Maheshwar]] south of [[Indore]] on the [[Narmada River]].\n\nAhilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of [[Kumher|Kumbher]] in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], died. A year after that she was crowned as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukojirao Holkar as the Chief of Army.\n\nRani Ahilyabai was a great pioneer and builder of [[Hindu temples]]. She built hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India.\n\n==Early life==\nAhilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day [[Ahmednagar district]] in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the [[Patil (title)|Patil]] of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nHer entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa [[Balaji Baji Rao]] and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723\u20131754). She was married to [[Khanderao Holkar]] in 1733. In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao and in 1748, a daughter Muktabai. Malerao was mentally unwell and died of his illness in 1767. Ahilyabai broke another tradition when she married her daughter to Yashwantrao a brave but poor man after he succeeded in defeating the dacoits.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Royal Palace of Maheshwar.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace of Maheshwar]]\n[[File:Rajwada of Ahilya Bai.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the royal palace (Rajwada), Maheshwar]]\n[[File:Statue of Ahilya Bai Holkar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ahilya Bai Holkar in the royal palace, Maheshwar]]\n\nHer husband was killed during the siege of [[Kumher]] in 1754.<ref name=kr1>{{cite book|author=Jaswant Lal Mehta |title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707\u20131813 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1wUgKKzawoC&pg=PA606 |date=1 January 2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

You may halt there for four or five days. You should keep your big artillery and arrange for its ammunition as much as possible....On the march you should arrange for military posts being located for protection of the road.\"''\n\nAlready trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar's death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar supported her leadership. She led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar [[Tukojirao Holkar]] (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear.\n\nAmong Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also supported the rise of merchants, farmers and cultivators to levels of affluence, and did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to their wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right.\n\nThere are many stories of her care for her people. In one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The Prime Minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh.\n\nAhilyadevi was not able to settle the conflict peacefully in the case of the [[Bhil people|Bhils]] and [[Gondi people|Gonds]], who plundered her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give \"considerate attention to their habits\".\n\nAhilyabai's capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, [[Moropant]] and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar.\n\nAfter her death, she was succeeded by [[Tukojirao Holkar|Tukoji Rao Holkar I]], her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son [[Kashi Rao Holkar]] in 1797.\n\n==Death==\n\nAhilyabai died on 13th August, 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore\u2019s history. Ironically, her daughter became a Sati by jumping into the funeral pyre when her husband, Yashwantrao Phanse, died. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief, Tukoji Rao Holkar I.\n\n==Views about her==\n{{quote farm|date=May 2019}}\n[[File: Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ahilybai Holkar, Maheshwar]]\n\"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years.

She loved to see her people prosper, and to watch the fine cities grow, and to watch that her subjects were not afraid to display their wealth, lest the ruler should snatch it from them. Far and wide the roads were planted with shady trees, and wells were made, and rest-houses for travelers. The poor, the homeless, the orphaned were all helped according to their needs. The Bhils who had long been the torment of all caravans were routed from their mountain fastnesses and persuaded to settle down as honest farmers. Hindu and Musalman alike revered the famous Queen and prayed for her long life. Her last great sorrow was when her daughter became a Sati upon the death of Yashwantrao Phanse.
