Always more of an entrepreneur than a showman, he concentrated on acquiring and building theaters. Beginning in 1914, New Jersey-based Fox bought films outright from the Balboa Amusement Producing Company in Long Beach, California, for distribution to his own theaters and then for rental to other theaters across the country. He formed the [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] on February 1, 1915, with insurance and banking money provided by the McCarter, Kuser and Usar families of Newark, New Jersey, and the small New Jersey investment house of Eisele and King. The company's first film studio was leased in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where many other early film studios were based at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name=\"TheFox\" /> He now had the capital to acquire facilities and expand his production capacity.\n\nIn 1925\u201326, Fox purchased the rights to the work of [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], the U.S. rights to the [[Tri-Ergon]] system invented by three German inventors (Josef Engl (1893\u20131942), Hans Vogt (1890\u20131979), and Joseph Massolle (1889\u20131957)), and the work of [[Theodore Case]] to create the Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] [[sound-on-film]] system, introduced in 1927 with the release of [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]''. Sound-on-film systems such as Movietone and [[RCA Photophone]] soon became the standard, and competing [[sound-on-disc]] technologies, such as [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Vitaphone]], became obsolete. From 1928 to 1964, [[Fox Movietone News]] was one of the major [[newsreel]] series in the U.S., along with [[The March of Time]] (1935\u20131951) and [[Universal Newsreel]] (1929\u20131967). \n\nAfter the death of [[Marcus Loew]], head of rival studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], in 1927, control of MGM passed to his longtime associate, [[Nicholas Schenck]]. Fox saw an opportunity to expand his empire, and in 1929, with Schenck's assent, bought the Loew family's MGM holdings, unbeknownst to studio bosses [[Louis B. Mayer]] and [[Irving Thalberg]] who were outraged, since, despite their high posts at MGM, they were not shareholders. Mayer used his strong political connections to persuade the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to sue Fox for violating federal [[antitrust]] laws. During this time, in the middle of 1929, Fox was badly hurt in an automobile accident. By the time he recovered, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] in October of 1929 had wiped out virtually his entire  fortune, ending any chance of the Loews-Fox merger going through even if the Justice Department had approved it.\n\nFox lost control of his Fox Film Corporation in 1930 during a [[hostile takeover]].

A combination of the stock market crash, Fox's car accident injuries, and government antitrust action, forced him into a protracted seven-year legal battle to stave off [[bankruptcy]]. At his bankruptcy hearing in 1936, he attempted to [[bribe]] judge [[John Warren Davis (judge)|John Warren Davis]] and committed [[perjury]].  In 1943, Fox served a five month and seventeen day sentence on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice and defraud the United States, in connection with his bankruptcy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/04/archives/william-fox-freed-from-prison-on-parole-has-served-5-months-in.html|title=William Fox Freed From Prison on Parole; Has Served 5 Months in Bankruptcy Case|last=|first=|date=1943-05-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-18|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> After serving his time, a disgraced and embarrassed Fox retired from the film business. \n\nFor many years, Fox resented the way that Wall Street had forced him from control of his company.

''Chiafalo'' deals with electors who received {{USD|1,000}} fines for voting contrary to state law in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The case was originally consolidated with ''[[Colorado Department of State v. Baca]]'', No. 19-518, a similar case involving an elector who was removed and replaced for voting contrary to his pledge in [[Colorado]]. However, on March 10, 2020, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] recused herself in the Colorado case due to a prior relation to a respondent, and the cases will now be decided separately. Oral arguments had been scheduled for April, but were subsequently postponed due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. It was then announced that oral arguments would be held via phone, scheduled for May 13, 2020.\n\n==Background==\n===Faithless electors===\n{{main|Faithless elector}}\nIn the [[United States Electoral College]], faithless electors are those who either cast electoral votes for someone other than the candidate of the party that they pledged to vote for or who [[Abstention|abstain]]. Thirty-two [[U.S. state|state]]s plus the [[District of Columbia]] have passed laws to prevent faithless electors,<ref>{{cite web |title=Faithless Elector State Laws |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws |website=Fair Vote |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Laws Binding Electors |url=http://presidentialelectorlaws.us |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref> but none had been enforced prior to 2016. In 1952, the constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ray v. Blair]]'', {{ussc|343|214|1952}}. The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate in order to be certified as electors, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. The court did not rule whether pledges were enforceable. Nevertheless, the court also wrote:\n\n{{quote|However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an ''assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 1, to vote as he may choose'' [emphasis added] in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional.}}\n\nIn his dissent, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], joined by Justice [[William O. Douglas]], wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text \u2013 that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\n===Washington law===\nFor the 2016 election, Washington state law [[Revised Code of Washington|RCW]] 29A.56.320 required electors, selected by their party, to vote for the candidate of their party during the presidential election, or otherwise be subject to a {{USD|1,000}} civil penalty.<ref name=\"sitimes\"/>\n\n==Case history==\n{{further|Faithless electors in the United States presidential election, 2016}}\nThe [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] was one of the more decisive ones in United States history, with the Democrats [[Hillary Clinton]] and her running mate [[Tim Kaine]] running against Republicans [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]]. Trump eventually won the election with 304 electoral votes to become the 45th [[President of the United States]] starting in 2017. There was a grassroots effort to convince electors to \"vote their conscience for the good of America\" in accordance with [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Federalist No. 68|Federalist Paper No. 68]] to try to sway electors to vote for an alternative Republican candidate, even if this were to violate their pledges, to deny Trump a majority in the electoral college and trigger a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/meet-the-hamilton-electors-hoping-for-an-electoral-college-revolt/508433/|title=Meet the 'Hamilton Electors' Campaigning for an Electoral College Revolt|last=O'Donnell|first=Lilly|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/ |title=Hamilton Electors |newspaper=Hamilton Electors |access-date=November 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122235026/http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/ |archivedate=November 22, 2016}}</ref> There had been an attempt by these \"Hamilton electors\" to trade faithless votes between electors of different parties to make a more effective impact on the electoral college, but this failed to come together, leaving most of the faithless votes coming from Democratic electors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/meet-the-hamilton-electors-hoping-for-an-electoral-college-revolt/508433/|title=Meet the 'Hamilton Electors' Campaigning for an Electoral College Revolt|last=O'Donnell|first=Lilly|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> \n\nFour Washington electors for the Democratic party who had signed pledges to vote for the Democratic nominee voted for candidates other than Clinton/Kaine.

At an initial hearing, an [[administrative law judge]] upheld the fines, stating he had no [[jurisdiction]] to rule on constitutional arguments, only whether the fines were applied in accordance with state law. At the first trial at the [[Thurston County, Washington|Thurston County]] Superior Court in 2017, the judge ruled against the constitutional argument and deemed the fines permissible.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/dec/13/faithless-electors-1000-fines-upheld/ | title = \u2018Faithless\u2019 electors $1,000 fines upheld | first=  Jim | last =Camden  |date = December 13, 2017 | accessdate= February 26, 2020 | work = [[The Spokesman-Review]] }}</ref> The three electors then appealed to the [[Washington Supreme Court]], which in May 2019 upheld the lower court ruling with an 8-1 vote.

Lessig argued that both cases offered the Supreme Court the opportunity to rule on the matter of faithless elector laws outside the realm of a contested election where their ruling would have a direct impact on the outcome, as in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. By clarifying how the Electoral College actually functions, Lessig and Equal Citizens hope to spur Electoral College reform via either a [[Amending the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] or the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Elector's Freedom |url=https://equalcitizens.us/electors-freedom/ |website=Equal Citizens |accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref> In the latter case, electors from states in the compact combined with electors pledged to the popular vote winner in non-compact states would conceivably create a buffer in electoral votes such that it would take an unprecedented number of faithless electors to threaten the electoral college majority of the popular vote winner.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:United States Supreme Court cases]]\n[[Category:2020 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:United States One Person, One Vote Legal Doctrine]]\n[[Category:Colorado law]]\n[[Category:Washington (state) law]]\n[[Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign]]\n[[Category:Stop Trump movement]]\n[[Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit cases]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Colorado]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Electoral College (United States)]]\n[[Category:United States Constitution Article Two case law]]\n[[Category:United States elections case law]]\n[[Category:Controversies of the 2016 United States presidential election]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pending United States Supreme Court case}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox SCOTUS case\n  |Litigants=Chiafalo v.

The court did not rule whether pledges were enforceable. Nevertheless, the court also wrote:\n\n{{quote|However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an ''assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 1, to vote as he may choose'' [emphasis added] in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional.}}\n\nIn his dissent, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], joined by Justice [[William O. Douglas]], wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text \u2013 that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\n===Washington law===\nFor the 2016 election, Washington state law [[Revised Code of Washington|RCW]] 29A.56.320 required electors, selected by their party, to vote for the candidate of their party during the presidential election, or otherwise be subject to a {{USD|1,000}} civil penalty.<ref name=\"sitimes\"/>\n\n==Case history==\n{{further|Faithless electors in the United States presidential election, 2016}}\nThe [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] was one of the more decisive ones in United States history, with the Democrats [[Hillary Clinton]] and her running mate [[Tim Kaine]] running against Republicans [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]]. Trump eventually won the election with 304 electoral votes to become the 45th [[President of the United States]] starting in 2017. There was a grassroots effort to convince electors to \"vote their conscience for the good of America\" in accordance with [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Federalist No. 68|Federalist Paper No. 68]] to try to sway electors to vote for an alternative Republican candidate, even if this were to violate their pledges, to deny Trump a majority in the electoral college and trigger a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/meet-the-hamilton-electors-hoping-for-an-electoral-college-revolt/508433/|title=Meet the 'Hamilton Electors' Campaigning for an Electoral College Revolt|last=O'Donnell|first=Lilly|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/ |title=Hamilton Electors |newspaper=Hamilton Electors |access-date=November 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122235026/http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/ |archivedate=November 22, 2016}}</ref> There had been an attempt by these \"Hamilton electors\" to trade faithless votes between electors of different parties to make a more effective impact on the electoral college, but this failed to come together, leaving most of the faithless votes coming from Democratic electors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/meet-the-hamilton-electors-hoping-for-an-electoral-college-revolt/508433/|title=Meet the 'Hamilton Electors' Campaigning for an Electoral College Revolt|last=O'Donnell|first=Lilly|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> \n\nFour Washington electors for the Democratic party who had signed pledges to vote for the Democratic nominee voted for candidates other than Clinton/Kaine.

At an initial hearing, an [[administrative law judge]] upheld the fines, stating he had no [[jurisdiction]] to rule on constitutional arguments, only whether the fines were applied in accordance with state law.
