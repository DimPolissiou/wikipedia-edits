It is based on the story ''Un Capitano Moro'' (\"A Moorish Captain\") by [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi|Cinthio]] (a disciple of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s), first published in 1565.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinthio\u02b9s Tale: The Source of Shakespeare\u02b9s Othello|url=https://cpb-ap-se2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.ststephens.wa.edu.au/dist/7/1263/files/2015/10/Cinthios-Tale-1rs1kwy.pdf|website=St. Stephen's School}}</ref> The story revolves around its two central characters: [[Othello (character)|Othello]], a [[Moors|Moorish]] general in the [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] army, and his treacherous [[ensign (rank)|ensign]], [[Iago]].

Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, for her hand in marriage.\n\nIago hates Othello for promoting a younger man named Cassio above him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself, and tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage. Iago convinces Roderigo to wake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter's [[elopement]]. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello and warns him that Brabantio is coming for him. When Brabantio finds out, he is angered, but after hearing Desdemona speak they allow the marriage because it was done out of her own will and not forced. Shortly after, Othello is told that he needs to leave Cyprus to fight the Ottomans. \n\nBrabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and will not rest until he has confronted Othello, but he finds Othello's residence full of the Duke of Venice's guards, who prevent violence. News has arrived in Venice that the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars|are going to attack]] [[Cyprus]], and Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompany Othello to the Duke's residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona by [[witchcraft]].\n\nOthello defends himself before the [[Doge|Duke of Venice]], Brabantio's kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, and various senators. Othello explains that Desdemona became enamoured of him for the sad and compelling stories he told of his life before Venice, not because of any witchcraft. The senate is satisfied, once Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello, but Brabantio leaves saying that Desdemona will betray Othello: \"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:/She has deceived her father, and may thee,\" (Act I, Sc 3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio's remark. By order of the Duke, Othello leaves Venice to command the Venetian armies against invading Turks on the island of [[Cyprus]], accompanied by his new wife, his new lieutenant Cassio, his ensign Iago, and Iago's wife, Emilia, as Desdemona's attendant.\n\n===Act II===\nDM and Penfold cant see anyone and hurry to the castle. Its locked so they play on the Nintendo Switches until a guard lets them in.\n\n===Act III===\nIago now persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona. When Desdemona drops a [[handkerchief]] (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it, and gives it to her husband Iago, at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello reenters and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife\u2019s unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant. Act III, scene iii is considered to be the turning point of the play as it is the scene in which Iago successfully sows the seeds of doubt in Othello's mind, inevitably sealing Othello's fate.\n\n===Act IV===\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.\n\nEnraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.\n\n===Act V===\n[[File:Othello's Lamentation.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[William Salter (artist)|William Salter]] of Othello weeping over Desdemona's body. Oil on canvas, ca. 1857.]]Roderigo, having been manipulated by Iago, attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's lodgings. Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to stop him revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.\n\nOthello confronts Desdemona, and then [[Strangling|strangles]] her in their bed. When Emilia arrives, Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives, with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what her husband Iago has done, and she exposes him, whereupon he kills her. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona's innocence, stabs Iago but not fatally, saying that Iago is a devil, and he would rather have him live the rest of his life in pain.\n\nIago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.\n\n==Sources==\n''Othello'' is an adaptation of the Italian writer [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi|Cinthio]]'s tale \"Un Capitano Moro\" (\"A Moorish Captain\") from his ''Gli Hecatommithi'' (1565), a collection of one hundred tales in the style of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]].'' No English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, and verbal echoes in ''Othello'' are closer to the Italian original than to [[Gabriel Chappuy]]'s 1584 French translation. Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508.<ref name=\"4trag\">Shakespeare, William. ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Bantam Books, 1988.</ref> It also resembles an incident described in the earlier tale of \"[[The Three Apples]]\", one of the stories narrated in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'').<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John G., M.D.|title=Essay: What Is Creativity?|journal=Adventures in Creativity: Multimedia Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|accessdate=17 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820111333/http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|archivedate=20 August 2008}}</ref> Desdemona is the only named character in Cinthio's tale, with his few other characters identified only as the \"[[Moors|Moor]]\", the \"Squadron Leader\", the \"Ensign\", and the \"Ensign's Wife\" (corresponding to the play's Othello, Cassio, Iago and Emilia). Cinthio drew a moral (which he placed in the mouth of Desdemona) that it is unwise for European women to marry the temperamental men of other nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgil.org/dswo/courses/shakespeare-survey/cinthio.pdf |title=Virgil.org |format=PDF |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref> Cinthio's tale has been described as a \"partly racist warning\" about the dangers of [[miscegenation]].<ref>[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare, William]].

Brabantio, Roderigo, and several minor characters are not found in Cinthio, for example, and Shakespeare's Emilia takes part in the handkerchief mischief while her counterpart in Cinthio does not. Unlike in ''Othello'', in Cinthio, the \"Ensign\" (the play's Iago) lusts after Desdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. Shakespeare's opening scenes are unique to his tragedy, as is the tender scene between Emilia and Desdemona as the lady prepares for bed. Shakespeare's most striking departure from Cinthio is the manner of his heroine's death. In Shakespeare, Othello suffocates Desdemona, but in Cinthio, the \"Moor\" commissions the \"Ensign\" to bludgeon his wife to death with a sand-filled stocking. Cinthio describes each gruesome blow, and, when the lady is dead, the \"Ensign\" and the \"Moor\" place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression its falling rafters caused her death. In Cinthio, the two murderers escape detection. The \"Moor\" then misses Desdemona greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of the \"Ensign\". He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his company. The \"Ensign\" then seeks revenge by disclosing to the \"Squadron Leader\" the \"Moor's\" involvement in Desdemona's death. The two depart Cyprus for Venice, and denounce the \"Moor\" to the Venetian Seigniory; he is arrested, taken to Venice, and tortured. He refuses to admit his guilt and is condemned to exile. Desdemona's relatives eventually find and kill him. The \"Ensign\", however, continues to escape detection in Desdemona's death, but engages in other crimes while in Venice. He is arrested and dies after being tortured. Cinthio's \"Ensign's Wife\" (the play's Emilia), survives her husband's death to tell her story.<ref>Bevington, David and Bevington, Kate (translators). \"Un Capitano Moro\" in ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''.

However, the version in the Folio is rather different in length, and in wording: as the editors of the Folger edition explain: \"The Folio play has about 160 lines that do not appear in the Quarto. Some of these cluster together in quite extensive passages. The Folio also lacks a scattering of about a dozen lines or part-lines that are to be found in the Quarto.

Throughout the play, good-natured characters make rash decisions based on the jealousy that they feel, most notably Othello.\n\nIn the early acts, Othello is depicted as a typical heroic figure and holds admirable qualities, written with the intention of winning over the favour of the audience; however, as the play goes on, jealousy will manipulate his decisions and lead him into sin. While the majority of the evil that Othello carries out in the play can be cited as coming from Iago, it is jealousy that motivates him to perform wicked deeds. When Iago highlights the almost excessive amount of time that Cassio and his wife, Desdemona, are spending together, Othello becomes filled with rage and, following a series of events, will murder the one that he loves.\n\nShakespeare explores man's ugliest trait in this opus and perfectly represents the idea of the 'tragic hero' in Othello, who wins over the responders early on but proceeds to make bad, almost wicked, decisions that will make it harder for the audience to like him until his eventual undoing. This idea of the tragic hero is made clear through the utilisation of jealousy, one of the various notable themes present in ''Othello''.\n\n===Iago versus Othello===\nAlthough its title suggests that the tragedy belongs primarily to Othello, Iago plays an important role in the plot. He reflects the archetypal villain and has the biggest share of the dialogue. In ''Othello'', it is Iago who manipulates all other characters at will, controlling their movements and trapping them in an intricate net of lies. He achieves this by getting close to all characters and playing on their weaknesses while they refer to him as \"honest\" Iago, thus furthering his control over the characters. [[A. C. Bradley]], and more recently [[Harold Bloom]], have been major advocates of this interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shakespeare |first=William |author2=Ruffiel, Burton |others=Bloom, Harold |title=Othello (Yale Shakespeare) |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005 |origyear= |isbn=0-300-10807-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/othello100shak }}</ref> Other critics, most notably in the later twentieth century (after [[F.

[[E. A. J. Honigmann]], the editor of the [[Arden Shakespeare]] edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. \"Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictory. As critics have established, the term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people in general, used interchangeably with terms such as 'African', 'Somali', 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and even 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond).\"<ref>''Making More of the Moor: Aaron, Othello, and Renaissance Refashionings of Race''. Emily C. Bartels</ref><ref>\"Moor, n2\", ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edtn.</ref> Various uses of the word ''black'' (for example, \"Haply for I am black\") are insufficient evidence for any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argues, since ''black'' could simply mean ''swarthy'' to Elizabethans. Iago twice uses the word ''Barbary'' or ''Barbarian'' to refer to Othello, seemingly referring to the [[Barbary]] coast inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Roderigo calls Othello \"the thicklips\", which seems to refer to Sub-Saharan African physiognomy, but Honigmann counters that, as these comments are all intended as insults by the characters, they need not be taken literally.<ref>[[E.

He stayed with his retinue in London for several months and occasioned much discussion.

But questions of race may not boil down to a simple decision of casting a single role. In 1979, [[Keith Fowler]]\u2019s production of ''Othello'' mixed the races throughout the company.  Produced by the [[Richmond, Virginia|American Revels Company]] at the Empire Theater (renamed the November Theater in 2011) in Richmond, Virginia, this production starred African American actor Clayton Corbin in the title role, with Henry K. Bal, a Hawaiian actor of mixed ethnicity, playing Iago.  Othello\u2019s army was composed of both black and white mercenaries.  Iago\u2019s wife, Emilia was played by the popular black actress [[Marie Goodman Hunter]].<ref>Roy Proctor, \"\u2019Othello\u2019 is Honest on Bare Stage,\" ''Richmond News Leader'' 10 February 1979</ref> The 2016 production at the New York Theatre Workshop, directed by [[Sam Gold]], also effectively used a mixed-race cast, starring English actors [[David Oyelowo]] as Othello and [[Daniel Craig]] as Iago. Desdemona was played by American actress [[Rachel Brosnahan]], Cassio was played by [[Finn Wittrock]], and Emilia was played by Marsha Stephanie Blake.\n\nAs the [[Protestant Reformation]] of England proclaimed the importance of pious, controlled behaviour in society, it was the tendency of the contemporary Englishman to displace society's \"undesirable\" qualities of barbarism, treachery, jealousy and libidinousness onto those who are considered \"other\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Eldred |title=Othello's Countrymen |location=Charlottesville |publisher=Univ of Virginia Press |year=1971 |isbn= }}</ref> The assumed characteristics of black men, or \"the other\", were both instigated and popularised by [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] dramas of the time; for example, the treachery of black men inherent to [[George Peele]]'s ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' (1588).<ref>Note also the character of Aaron the Moor in Shakespeare's play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''</ref> It has been argued that it is Othello's \"otherness\" which makes him so vulnerable to manipulation. Audiences of the time would expect Othello to be insecure about his race and the implied age gap between himself and Desdemona.\n\n===Religious and philosophical===\n\nThe title \"Moor\" implies a religious \"other\" of North African or Middle Eastern descent.

A.C. Bradley calls Othello the \"most romantic of all of Shakespeare's heroes\" (by \"hero\" Bradley means protagonist) and \"the greatest poet of them all\". On the other hand, F.R. Leavis describes Othello as \"egotistical\". There are those who also take a less critical approach to the character of Othello such as [[William Hazlitt]], who said: \"the nature of the Moor is noble ... but his blood is of the most inflammable kind\".\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Thomas Keene in Othello 1884 Poster.JPG|thumb|Poster for an 1884 American production starring [[Thomas W.

[[Nicholas Burt]] played the lead, with [[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] as Cassio; [[Walter Clun]] won fame for his Iago. Soon after, on 8 December 1660, [[Thomas Killigrew]]'s new [[King's Company]] acted the play at their Vere Street theatre, with [[Margaret Hughes]] as Desdemona \u2013 probably the first time a professional actress appeared on a public stage in England.\n\nIt may be one index of the play's power that ''Othello'' was one of the very few Shakespearean plays that was never adapted and changed during the Restoration and the eighteenth century.<ref>F.

It ran for 296 performances, almost twice as long as any other Shakespearean play ever produced on Broadway. Although it was never filmed, it was the first lengthy performance of a Shakespeare play released on records, first on a multi-record 78 RPM set and then on a 3-LP one.

The critics had mixed reactions to the \"flashy\" 1959 production which included mid-western accents and rock-and roll drumbeats but gave Robeson primarily good reviews.<ref>Duberman, p. 477</ref> [[W. A. Darlington]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ranked Robeson's Othello as the best he had ever seen<ref>Duberman, p. 733, notes for pp. 475\u2013478</ref> while the ''[[Daily Express]]'', which had for years before published consistently scathing articles about Robeson for his leftist views, praised his \"strong and stately\" performance (though in turn suggested it was a \"triumph of presence not acting\").<ref>''Daily Express'', 10 April 1959</ref>\n\nActors have alternated the roles of Iago and Othello in productions to stir audience interest since the nineteenth century. Two of the most notable examples of this role swap were [[William Charles Macready]] and [[Samuel Phelps]] at [[Drury Lane]] (1837) and [[Richard Burton]] and [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] at [[The Old Vic]] (1955). When [[Edwin Booth]]'s tour of England in 1880 was not well attended, [[Henry Irving]] invited Booth to alternate the roles of Othello and Iago with him in London. The stunt renewed interest in Booth's tour. [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]] also alternated the roles of Othello and Iago with Booth.\n\nThe American actor [[William Marshall (actor)|William Marshall]] performed the title role in at least six productions. His Othello was called by [[Harold Hobson]] of the ''London Sunday Times'' \"the best Othello of our time,\"<ref>Jet magazine, 30 June 2003</ref> continuing:\n<blockquote>\n...nobler than [[Godfrey Tearle|Tearle]], more martial than [[John Gielgud|Gielgud]], more poetic than [[Frederick Valk|Valk]].

The 1982 Broadway staging starred [[James Earl Jones]] as Othello and [[Christopher Plummer]] as Iago, who became the only actor to receive a [[Tony Award]] nomination for a performance in the play.\n\nWhen [[Laurence Olivier]] gave his acclaimed performance of Othello at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in 1964, he had developed a case of stage fright that was so profound that when he was alone onstage, [[Frank Finlay]] (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves.<ref>Laurence Olivier, ''Confessions of an Actor'', Simon and Schuster (1982) p. 262</ref> This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). [[Othello (1965 British film)|The film version]] still holds the record for the most [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film \u2013 Olivier, Finlay, [[Maggie Smith]] (as Desdemona) and [[Joyce Redman]] (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for [[Academy Awards]]. Olivier was among the last white actors to be greatly acclaimed as Othello, although the role continued to be played by such performers as [[Donald Sinden]] at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1979\u20131980, [[Paul Scofield]] at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in 1980, [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the ''[[BBC Television Shakespeare]]'' production (1981), and [[Michael Gambon]] in a stage production at Scarborough directed by [[Alan Ayckbourn]] in 1990. Gambon had been in Olivier's earlier production. In an interview Gambon commented \"I wasn't even the second gentleman in that. I didn't have any lines at all. I was at the back like that, standing for an hour. [It's] what I used to do \u2013 I had a metal helmet, I had an earplug, and we used to listen to ''[[The Archers]]''. No one knew. All the line used to listen to ''The Archers''. And then I went and played Othello myself at [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Birmingham Rep]] I was 27. Olivier sent me a telegram on the first night. He said, \"Copy me.\" He said, \"Do what I used to do.\" Olivier used to lower his voice for Othello so I did mine. He used to paint the big negro lips on. You couldn't do it today, you'd get shot. He had the complete negro face. And the hips. I did all that. I copied him exactly. Except I had a pony tail. I played him as an Arab. I stuck a pony tail on with a bell on the end of it.

Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, for her hand in marriage.\n\nIago hates Othello for promoting a younger man named Cassio above him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself, and tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage. Iago convinces Roderigo to wake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter's [[elopement]]. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello and warns him that Brabantio is coming for him. When Brabantio finds out, he is angered, but after hearing Desdemona speak they allow the marriage because it was done out of her own will and not forced. Shortly after, Othello is told that he needs to leave Cyprus to fight the Ottomans. \n\nBrabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and will not rest until he has confronted Othello, but he finds Othello's residence full of the Duke of Venice's guards, who prevent violence. News has arrived in Venice that the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars|are going to attack]] [[Cyprus]], and Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompany Othello to the Duke's residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona by [[witchcraft]].\n\nOthello defends himself before the [[Doge|Duke of Venice]], Brabantio's kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, and various senators. Othello explains that Desdemona became enamoured of him for the sad and compelling stories he told of his life before Venice, not because of any witchcraft. The senate is satisfied, once Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello, but Brabantio leaves saying that Desdemona will betray Othello: \"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:/She has deceived her father, and may thee,\" (Act I, Sc 3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio's remark. By order of the Duke, Othello leaves Venice to command the Venetian armies against invading Turks on the island of [[Cyprus]], accompanied by his new wife, his new lieutenant Cassio, his ensign Iago, and Iago's wife, Emilia, as Desdemona's attendant.\n\n===Act II===\nThe party arrives in Cyprus to find that a storm has destroyed the Turkish fleet. Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marriage with Desdemona. In his absence, Iago gets Cassio drunk, and then persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries to calm down an angry and drunk Cassio and this leads to them fighting one another. Montano is injured in the fight. Othello reenters and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio for the disturbance and strips him of his rank. Cassio is distraught. Iago persuades Cassio to ask Desdemona to persuade her husband to reinstate him.\n\n===Act III===\nIago now persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona. When Desdemona drops a [[handkerchief]] (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it, and gives it to her husband Iago, at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello reenters and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife\u2019s unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant. Act III, scene iii is considered to be the turning point of the play as it is the scene in which Iago successfully sows the seeds of doubt in Othello's mind, inevitably sealing Othello's fate.\n\n===Act IV===\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.\n\nEnraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.\n\n===Act V===\n[[File:Othello's Lamentation.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[William Salter (artist)|William Salter]] of Othello weeping over Desdemona's body. Oil on canvas, ca. 1857.]]Roderigo, having been manipulated by Iago, attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's lodgings. Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to stop him revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.\n\nOthello confronts Desdemona, and then [[Strangling|strangles]] her in their bed. When Emilia arrives, Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives, with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what her husband Iago has done, and she exposes him, whereupon he kills her. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona's innocence, stabs Iago but not fatally, saying that Iago is a devil, and he would rather have him live the rest of his life in pain.\n\nIago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.\n\n==Sources==\n''Othello'' is an adaptation of the Italian writer [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi|Cinthio]]'s tale \"Un Capitano Moro\" (\"A Moorish Captain\") from his ''Gli Hecatommithi'' (1565), a collection of one hundred tales in the style of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]].'' No English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, and verbal echoes in ''Othello'' are closer to the Italian original than to [[Gabriel Chappuy]]'s 1584 French translation. Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508.<ref name=\"4trag\">Shakespeare, William. ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Bantam Books, 1988.</ref> It also resembles an incident described in the earlier tale of \"[[The Three Apples]]\", one of the stories narrated in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'').<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John G., M.D.|title=Essay: What Is Creativity?|journal=Adventures in Creativity: Multimedia Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|accessdate=17 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820111333/http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|archivedate=20 August 2008}}</ref> Desdemona is the only named character in Cinthio's tale, with his few other characters identified only as the \"[[Moors|Moor]]\", the \"Squadron Leader\", the \"Ensign\", and the \"Ensign's Wife\" (corresponding to the play's Othello, Cassio, Iago and Emilia). Cinthio drew a moral (which he placed in the mouth of Desdemona) that it is unwise for European women to marry the temperamental men of other nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgil.org/dswo/courses/shakespeare-survey/cinthio.pdf |title=Virgil.org |format=PDF |accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref> Cinthio's tale has been described as a \"partly racist warning\" about the dangers of [[miscegenation]].<ref>[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare, William]].

Brabantio, Roderigo, and several minor characters are not found in Cinthio, for example, and Shakespeare's Emilia takes part in the handkerchief mischief while her counterpart in Cinthio does not. Unlike in ''Othello'', in Cinthio, the \"Ensign\" (the play's Iago) lusts after Desdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. Shakespeare's opening scenes are unique to his tragedy, as is the tender scene between Emilia and Desdemona as the lady prepares for bed. Shakespeare's most striking departure from Cinthio is the manner of his heroine's death. In Shakespeare, Othello suffocates Desdemona, but in Cinthio, the \"Moor\" commissions the \"Ensign\" to bludgeon his wife to death with a sand-filled stocking. Cinthio describes each gruesome blow, and, when the lady is dead, the \"Ensign\" and the \"Moor\" place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression its falling rafters caused her death. In Cinthio, the two murderers escape detection. The \"Moor\" then misses Desdemona greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of the \"Ensign\". He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his company. The \"Ensign\" then seeks revenge by disclosing to the \"Squadron Leader\" the \"Moor's\" involvement in Desdemona's death. The two depart Cyprus for Venice, and denounce the \"Moor\" to the Venetian Seigniory; he is arrested, taken to Venice, and tortured. He refuses to admit his guilt and is condemned to exile. Desdemona's relatives eventually find and kill him. The \"Ensign\", however, continues to escape detection in Desdemona's death, but engages in other crimes while in Venice. He is arrested and dies after being tortured. Cinthio's \"Ensign's Wife\" (the play's Emilia), survives her husband's death to tell her story.<ref>Bevington, David and Bevington, Kate (translators). \"Un Capitano Moro\" in ''Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''.

However, the version in the Folio is rather different in length, and in wording: as the editors of the Folger edition explain: \"The Folio play has about 160 lines that do not appear in the Quarto. Some of these cluster together in quite extensive passages. The Folio also lacks a scattering of about a dozen lines or part-lines that are to be found in the Quarto. These two versions also differ from each other in their readings of numerous words.<ref name=\"Barbara Mowat 1993\">Paul Westine and Barbara Mowat, eds.

Throughout the play, good-natured characters make rash decisions based on the jealousy that they feel, most notably Othello.\n\nIn the early acts, Othello is depicted as a typical heroic figure and holds admirable qualities, written with the intention of winning over the favour of the audience; however, as the play goes on, jealousy will manipulate his decisions and lead him into sin. While the majority of the evil that Othello carries out in the play can be cited as coming from Iago, it is jealousy that motivates him to perform wicked deeds. When Iago highlights the almost excessive amount of time that Cassio and his wife, Desdemona, are spending together, Othello becomes filled with rage and, following a series of events, will murder the one that he loves.\n\nShakespeare explores man's ugliest trait in this opus and perfectly represents the idea of the 'tragic hero' in Othello, who wins over the responders early on but proceeds to make bad, almost wicked, decisions that will make it harder for the audience to like him until his eventual undoing. This idea of the tragic hero is made clear through the utilisation of jealousy, one of the various notable themes present in ''Othello''.\n\n===Iago versus Othello===\nAlthough its title suggests that the tragedy belongs primarily to Othello, Iago plays an important role in the plot. He reflects the archetypal villain and has the biggest share of the dialogue. In ''Othello'', it is Iago who manipulates all other characters at will, controlling their movements and trapping them in an intricate net of lies. He achieves this by getting close to all characters and playing on their weaknesses while they refer to him as \"honest\" Iago, thus furthering his control over the characters. [[A. C.

[[E. A. J. Honigmann]], the editor of the [[Arden Shakespeare]] edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. \"Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictory. As critics have established, the term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people in general, used interchangeably with terms such as 'African', 'Somali', 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and even 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond).\"<ref>''Making More of the Moor: Aaron, Othello, and Renaissance Refashionings of Race''. Emily C. Bartels</ref><ref>\"Moor, n2\", ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edtn.</ref> Various uses of the word ''black'' (for example, \"Haply for I am black\") are insufficient evidence for any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argues, since ''black'' could simply mean ''swarthy'' to Elizabethans. Iago twice uses the word ''Barbary'' or ''Barbarian'' to refer to Othello, seemingly referring to the [[Barbary]] coast inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Roderigo calls Othello \"the thicklips\", which seems to refer to Sub-Saharan African physiognomy, but Honigmann counters that, as these comments are all intended as insults by the characters, they need not be taken literally.<ref>[[E.

But questions of race may not boil down to a simple decision of casting a single role. In 1979, [[Keith Fowler]]\u2019s production of ''Othello'' mixed the races throughout the company.  Produced by the [[Richmond, Virginia|American Revels Company]] at the Empire Theater (renamed the November Theater in 2011) in Richmond, Virginia, this production starred African American actor Clayton Corbin in the title role, with Henry K.

When [[Edwin Booth]]'s tour of England in 1880 was not well attended, [[Henry Irving]] invited Booth to alternate the roles of Othello and Iago with him in London.

[[Othello (1965 British film)|The film version]] still holds the record for the most [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film \u2013 Olivier, Finlay, [[Maggie Smith]] (as Desdemona) and [[Joyce Redman]] (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for [[Academy Awards]].

{"title_page": "Shock therapy (economics)", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|{{refimprove|date=October 2017}}\n{{weasel|date=October 2015}}}}\nIn [[economics]], '''shock therapy''' is the sudden release of price and currency controls ([[economic liberalization]]), withdrawal of state subsidies, and immediate [[Free trade|trade liberalization]] within a country, usually also including large-scale [[privatization]] of previously public-owned assets.\n\n==Overview==\nThe term was popularized by [[Naomi Klein]]. In her 2007 book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'', she argues that [[neoliberal]] [[free market]] policies (as advocated by the economist [[Milton Friedman]]) have risen to prominence in some developed countries because of a deliberate strategy of \"shock therapy\". [[Johan Norberg]] of the [[Cato Institute]] criticized the book, saying that the concept of shock therapy is falsely attributed to Friedman. According to Norberg, Friedman's quote (\"Only a crisis\u2014actual or perceived\u2014produces real change\") is taken out of context and misinterpreted.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/bp102.pdf | title=The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics | accessdate= August 28, 2008 |publisher= [[Cato Institute]]}}</ref>\n\nThe economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] (sometimes credited with coining the term) says he never picked the term \"shock therapy\", does not much like it, and asserts that the term \"was something that was overlaid by journalism and public discussion\" and that the term \"sounds a lot more painful in a way than what it is\". Sachs' ideas on what has been referred by non-economists as \"shock therapy\" were based on studying historic periods of monetary and economic crisis and noting that a decisive stroke could end monetary chaos, often in a day.<ref name=PBS/>\n\nThe first instance of shock therapy was the neoliberal reforms of [[Miracle of Chile|Chile in 1975]],<ref>Greg Grandin, Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism (Holt Paperbacks 2006)</ref> carried out after the military coup by [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The reforms were based on the liberal economic ideas centered on the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nThe term is also applied to [[Bolivia]]'s case. Bolivia successfully tackled [[hyperinflation]] in 1985 under [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], using Sachs' ideas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In particular, Sachs and Sanchez de Lozada cited [[West Germany]] as inspiration where, during 1947\u201348, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the German economy and completing its transition from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] post-War state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Economic liberalism]] rose to prominence after the 1970s and liberal shock therapy became increasingly used as a response to economic crises, for example by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Liberal shock therapy became very controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilise economies and pave the way for [[economic growth]], while its critics (like [[Joseph Stiglitz]]) believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily<ref name=StiglitzDiscontents/> and created unnecessary social suffering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn Russia and other post-Communist states, neoliberal reforms based on the [[Washington Consensus]] resulted in a surge in excess mortality<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7828901.stm Privatisation 'raised death rate'].

It faced war damage to its economy and the problems of mass migration due to the expulsion of ethnic Germans from areas east of the Oder-Neisse Line.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nApril 1945 to July 1947 saw the Allied occupation of Germany implement [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directive 1067 ([[JCS 1067]]). This directive aimed to transfer Germany's economy from one centred on heavy industry to a pastoral one to prevent Germany from having the capacity for war. Civilian industries that might have military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's ''approved peacetime needs'', which were set on the average European standard. To achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements. In May 1946, the first plan stated that German heavy industry must be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants. Restrictions on steel followed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIt soon became obvious that this policy was not sustainable. Germany could not grow enough food for itself and malnutrition was becoming increasingly common. The European post-war economic recovery did not materialise and it became increasingly obvious that the European economy had depended on German industry.<ref name=\"WikiMorgenthau\" />\n\nIn July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \"national security grounds\" the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.\" It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that \"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"<ref name=\"TimePdP\" />\n\nBy 1948, Germany suffered from rampant hyperinflation. The currency of the time (the [[Reichsmark]]) had no public confidence, and thanks to that and price controls, [[black market]] trading boomed and bartering proliferated. Banks were over their heads in debt and surplus currency abounded.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\nHowever, thanks to the introduction of JCS 1779 and the first Allied attempts to set up German governance, something could be done about this. [[Ludwig Erhard]], an economist, who had spent much time working on the problem of post war recovery, had worked his way up the administration created by the occupying American forces until he became the Director of Economics in the [[Bizone|Bizonal]] Economic Council in the joint British and American occupied zones (which later, with the addition of the French occupied territory, became the basis for West Germany). He was placed in charge of currency reform and became a central figure in events that were to follow.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Economic reforms====\nIn spring of 1948, the Allies decided to reform the currency. In preparation for this, a new central bank system was established in West Germany with independent Land Central Banks and the Bank deutscher Lander with headquarters in Frankfurt am Main.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nCurrency reform took effect on June 20, 1948, through the introduction of the [[Deutsche Mark]] to replace the [[Reichsmark]] and by transferring to the Bank deutscher Lander the sole right to print money. Each person received a per capita allowance of 60 DM, payable in two installments (40 DM and 20 DM) and business quota of 60 DM per employee. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nUnder the [[Deutsche Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|German Currency Conversion Law]] on 27 June, private non-bank credit balances were converted at a rate of 10 RM to 1 DM, with half remaining in a frozen bank account. Although the money stock was very small in terms of national product, the adjustment in the price structure immediately led to sharp price increases, fuelled by the high velocity of money through the system. As a result, on 4 October, the military governments wiped out 70% of the remaining frozen balances, resulting in an effective exchange of 10:0.65. Holders of financial assets (including many small-time savers) were dispossessed and the banks' debt in Reichsmarks was eliminated, transferred instead into claims on the Lander and later the Federal Government. Wages, rents, pensions and other recurring liabilities were transferred at 1:1.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nOn the day of the currency reform, [[Ludwig Erhard]] announced, despite the reservations of the Allies, that rationing would be considerably relaxed and price controls abolished.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\n====Results====\nIn the short term, the currency reforms and abolition of price controls helped end hyperinflation. The new currency enjoyed considerable confidence and was accepted by the public as a medium of payment. The currency reforms had ensured that money was once more scarce, and the relaxation of price controls created incentives for production, sales and earning this money. The removal of price controls also meant shops filled up with goods again, which was a huge psychological factor in the adoption of the new currency.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\nIn the long term, these reforms helped set the stage for the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (German for economic miracle) in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Chile 1975===\nChile's reforms under the government of [[Augusto Pinochet]] are held as the origin of neoliberal shock therapy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Economic reforms====\nThe government welcomed foreign investment and eliminated protectionist [[trade barriers]], forcing Chilean businesses to compete with imports on an equal footing, or else go out of business. The main copper company, [[Codelco]], remained in government hands due the nationalization of copper completed by [[Salvador Allende]], however, private companies were allowed to explore and develop new mines. Copper resources were, however, declared \"inalienable\" by the 1980 Constitution.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the short term, the reforms stabilised the economy.\n\nIn the long term, Chile has had higher GDP growth than its neighbouring countries, but also high [[gini index]], expressed in a noticeable inequality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Bolivia 1985===\nThe term ''shock therapy'' originates from Bolivia's tackling of hyper-inflation in 1985, and was thought to have been coined by the media.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On 29 August, just three weeks after the election of [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] as President, and the appointment of [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], the architect of shock therapy, as Planning Minister, Decree 21060 was passed. This decree tackled all aspects of the Bolivian economy and ended the hyper-inflation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Background====\nBetween 1979 and 1982, Bolivia was ruled by a series of coups, counter-coups, and caretaker governments, including the notorious dictatorship of [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza Tejada]]. This period of political instability set the stage for the hyperinflation that later crippled the country. In October 1982, the military convened a Congress elected in 1980 to lead choose a new Chief Executive.<ref name=\"WikiBolivia\"/> The country elected [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]], under whose term the galloping hyperinflationary process started. Zuazo received scant support from the political parties or members of congress, most of whom were eager to flex their newly acquired political muscles after so many years of authoritarianism. Zuazo refused to take extra-constitutional powers (as previous military governments had done in similar crises) and concentrated on preserving the democracy instead, shortening his term by one year in response to his unpopularity and the crisis racking his country.<ref name=\"Zuazo\"/> On 6 August 1985, President [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] was elected. He appointed his President of the Senate, [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], as Planning Minister with a mandate to fix the economy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Prelude to Decree 21060====\n[[Decree 21060]] was the famous decree that covered all aspects of the Bolivian economy, later referred to as shock therapy. In the run-up to the decree, [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] recalls what the new government set out to do:\n\n{{quote|People felt you couldn't stop hyperinflation in a democracy; that you had to have a military government, an authoritarian government to take all these tough steps that had to be taken. Bolivia was the first country to stop hyperinflation in a democracy without depriving people of their civil rights and without violating human rights.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>}}\n\nIn the three weeks between the inauguration of the President and decree 21060, he notes:\n\n{{quote|We spent one week saying, \"Do we really need to do something? Do we really need radical change?\" and then another week debating shock treatment versus gradualism. Finally, we took one week to write it all up.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>}}\n\nOnce they had decided to act, de Lozada recalls that\n\n{{quote|there was a big discussion whether you could stop hyperinflation or inflation, period, by taking gradual steps. Many people said you had to take it slowly. You have to cure the patient. Shock treatment means you have a very sick patient [and] you have to operate before the patient dies. You have to get the cancer out, or you have to stop the infection. That's why we coined the phrase that inflation is like a tiger and you have only one shot; if you don't get it with that one shot, it'll get you. You have a credibility that you have to achieve. If you keep to gradualism, people don't believe you, and the hyperinflation just keeps roaring stronger. So shock therapy is get it over, get it done, stop hyperinflation, and then start rebuilding your economy so you achieve growth.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>}}\n\nIt is notable that de Lozada viewed shock therapy as an issue of political credibility, and less an economic issue as Sachs, its economic pioneer, did. Like Sachs, he was strongly influenced by the German government in 1947, but noted that they, like the new Bolivian government of Victor Paz, were a new government that acted decisively in the first 100 days, resolving the economic situation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Decree 21060====\n{{main|Decree 21060}}\n\nDecree 21060 included the following measures:\n* Allowing the peso to float.\n* Ending price controls and eliminating subsidies to the public sector.\n* Cutting two thirds of the employees of the state oil and tin companies. Freezing the pay of the remaining employees and public sector workers.\n* Liberalising import tariffs by imposing a uniform 20% tariff.\n* Stopping the payment of foreign debt under a deal negotiated with the IMF.\n\n====Results====\nIn the short term, the decree smothered hyperinflation. Within a few months, inflation had dropped to between 10 and 20 percent. The crash of the tin market in October of the same year and the reforms led to an estimated unemployment rate of 21.5 percent by 1987 (the unemployment rate had risen steadily from 5.5 percent in 1978 to 10.9 percent in 1982, 15.5 percent in 1984, and 20 percent in 1986).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Post-Communist states===\nThe next important chapter in the history of shock therapy was the collapse of communism in Europe in 1989. This left many post-communist states in central and eastern Europe with centralised authoritarian economies that had to transition to decentralised, market-orientated capitalist economies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nInspired by [[Bolivia]]'s example, and advised by institutions like the [[International Monetary Fund]] and individuals like [[Jeffrey Sachs]], many countries chose shock therapy to shake off the economic lethargy of the [[communism|communist]] era and transition to the capitalist systems. These transitions provide an interesting and important view into shock therapy and its consequences, especially when contrasted with [[China]], which began a gradualist transition (the opposite of the shock therapy approach) in 1978 under [[Deng Xiaoping]].\n\nAdvocates of shock therapy view [[Poland]] as the success story of shock therapy in the post-communist states and point out that shock therapy was not applied appropriately in [[Russia]], while critics point out that Poland's reforms were the most gradualist of all the countries and compare China's reforms with those of Russia<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/> and their vastly different effects.\n\n====Background====\n\nAfter the failure of the Communist government in the elections of June 4, 1989, it became clear that the previous regime was no longer legitimate. The unofficial talks at Magdalenka and then the [[Polish Round Table]] talks of 1989 allowed for a peaceful transition of power to the democratically elected government.\n\nThe economic situation was that inflation was high, peaking at around 600%, and the majority of state-owned monopolies and holdings were largely ineffective and completely obsolete in terms of technology. Although there was practically no unemployment in Poland, wages were low and the [[shortage economy]] led to a lack of even the most basic foodstuffs in the shops. Unlike the other post-communist countries, however, Poland did have some experience with a capitalist economy, as there was still private property in agriculture and food was still sold in farmers' markets.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\nIn September 1989 a commission of experts was formed under the presidency of Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's leading economist, Minister of Finance and deputy [[Premier of Poland]]. Among the members of the commission were Jeffrey Sachs, [[Stanis\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], [[Stefan Kawalec]] and [[Wojciech Misi\u0105g]]. The commission prepared a plan of extensive reforms that were to enable fast transformation of Poland's economy from obsolete and ineffective central planning to advanced capitalism, as adopted by the states of Western Europe and America.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Balcerowicz Plan====\n\n{{main|Balcerowicz Plan}}\n\nOn October 6 the program was presented on public television and in December the [[Sejm]] passed a packet of 11 acts, all of which were signed by the president on December 31, 1989. These were:\n\n# ''Act on Financial Economy Within State-owned Companies'', which allowed for state-owned businesses to declare bankruptcy and ended the fiction by which companies were able to exist even if their effectiveness and accountability was close to none.\n# ''Act on Banking Law'', which forbade financing the state [[budget deficit]] by the national [[central bank]] and forbade the issue of new currency.\n# ''Act on Credits'', which abolished the preferential laws on credits for state-owned companies and tied [[interest rate]]s to [[inflation]].\n# ''Act on Taxation of Excessive Wage Rise'', introducing the so-called [[popiwek|popiwek tax]] limiting the wage increase in state-owned companies in order to limit [[hyperinflation]].\n# ''Act on New Rules of Taxation'', introducing common taxation for all companies and abolishing special taxes that could previously have been applied to private companies through means of administrative decision.\n# ''Act on Economic Activity of Foreign Investors'', allowing foreign companies and private people to invest in Poland and export their profits abroad.\n# ''Act on Foreign Currencies'', introducing internal exchangeability of the [[z\u0142oty]] and abolishing the state monopoly in international trade.\n# ''Act on Customs Law'', creating a uniform customs rate for all companies.\n# ''Act on Employment'', regulating the duties of unemployment agencies.\n# ''Act on Special Circumstances Under Which a Worker Could be Laid Off'', protecting the workers of state firms from being fired in large numbers and guaranteeing unemployment grants and severance pay.\n\nPrivatization of companies was left until later.\n\n====Results====\n\nIn the short term, the reforms smothered the building hyperinflation before it reached high levels,<ref name=\"PolBalLec\"/> ended food shortages, restored goods on the shelves of shops and halved the absence of employees in the work place.<ref name=\"PolTime\"/> However, the reforms also caused many state companies to close at once, leaving their workers unemployed, and government statistics show this change as unemployment rose from 0.3% in January 1990 (just after the reforms) to 6.5% by the end of that year,<ref name=\"GUSUnemployment\"/> and a shrinking in the GDP for the next two consecutive years by 9.78% in the first and 7.02% (see main article).\n\nIn the long term, the reforms paved the way for economic recovery, with the GDP growing steadily to about 6\u20137% between 1995\u20137, falling to a low of 1.2% in 2001 before rising back up to the 6\u20137% region by 2007,<ref name=\"PolGDP\"/> often led by small service businesses, long suppressed by the Communist government.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/> However, despite GDP indicating prosperity for Poland, the unemployment rate continued to rise steadily, peaking at 16.9% in July 1994 before steadily falling down to a low of 9.5% in August 1998 before rising once more to a high of 20.7% in February 2003, from which it had fallen until the year 2008.<ref name=\"GUSUnemployment\"/> During the early years, the unemployment rate is thought to have been lower due to many of those claiming unemployment working in the grey (informal) economy, although this can account for no more than 5% of the unemployment rate.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/>\n\nThe long-term results of shock therapy point to both a rise and a fall{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} in living standards. Ownership of consumables (cars, TVs, VCRs, washing machines, refrigerators, personal computers, etc.) boomed, as did consumption of fruit and vegetables, meat and fish.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/> However, the huge economic adjustment Poland underwent created massive anxiety.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/>\n\n==Applications==\nThis section records all known applications of shock therapy in the world not mentioned under the history section above.\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe economic reforms of New Zealand's 1984 [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government, collectively known as [[Rogernomics]] (after New Zealand [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Roger Douglas]]), constitute an example of shock therapy.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Toward Better Governance - Public Service Reform in New Zealand (1984-94) and its Relevance to Canada|last = Holmes|first = J.

The 'shock' element of the New Zealand experiment, can be considered as such, because the Labour Party initially complied with its policies, not withdrawing its support until later in Roger's term.\n\n===Post-Soviet===\nSince the USSR's dissolution, the [[post-Soviet states]] faced many problems.

When economic liberalism came to this nation, the government took Sachs' advice and immediately withdrew regulations, price controls and subsidies to state-owned industries. However, with respect to the privatization of the state sector (which may or may not be considered as part of shock therapy depending on the definition being used) the change was much more gradualist. Whereas many economic factors were immediately applied{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, privatization of state-owned enterprises was delayed until society could safely handle the divestiture, as contrasted with the '[[business oligarch|robber baron]]' state of affairs in [[Russia]].\n\nProductivity increased although at the same time unemployment rates rose as well.

Hyperinflations see a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and the [[velocity of money]]. Either one, or both of these together, is the root cause of hyperinflation and in both models, one follows from the other.\n\nIn the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent\u2014whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless, they want to spend them in preference to holding notes that will lose value. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic Vienna, and capital flight, sometimes because of \"contagion\" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself. A crisis of confidence is particularly damaging to a [[fiat money|fiat currency]] (i.e. most modern currencies), a currency whose value is unrelated to any physical quantity, as fiat money is typically backed by future tax revenues and its (typically exclusive) acceptability to the government for payment of taxes and charges.\n\nIn the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When businesspeople perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot \"win\" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.\n\nEnding hyperinflation depends on which model is the main cause. In the confidence model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency\u2014often by issuing a completely new one. Also, if possible, any action that restores confidence in the government can help end the hyperinflation (e.g. the psychological effect of food in the shops after shortages in most hyperinflations, the election of a new government both capable of and dedicated to tackling the problem). In the monetary model, the issuer of the currency must stop expanding the currency.\n\n===Shock therapy as an artificial economic shock===\nA [[shock (economics)|shock]] in economics is defined as an unexpected or unpredictable event that affects an economy, either positively or negatively. Recessions are often modelled as negative economic shocks in which the current state of the economy is untenable and the economy tries to restore itself to a new equilibrium position. In the [[short-run]], as the economy adjusts to the shock but before it reaches the new equilibrium, the shock often causes productivity to fall, unemployment rise,<ref name=\"EconomicsForDummies\"/> and closure of firms that are now non-viable in the new environment. The new environment enables new kinds of businesses and people must learn new skills and exploit new opportunities to achieve [[long-run]] equilibrium.\n\nShock therapy can be largely understood by thinking of it as an artificial shock imposed by government policies. [[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical theory]] provides a very useful tool in trying to describe an artificial shock theoretically, in that neoclassical theory provides an idealised view of an economy based on certain assumptions, most of which are made true through market institutions (often but not necessarily provided by the government), law, culture or historical practise, and is very useful in explaining most situations (especially in modern Westernised economies). Even when some of the assumptions required for neoclassical theory are not in place resulting in an [[imperfect market]] and the results of neoclassical theory becoming distorted or failing, comparing the result with neoclassical theory can prove useful. Other, slightly different formulations of economic thought strive to describe shocks, the most important of which is [[economic liberalism]].\n\n====Neoclassical shocks====\nIn neoclassical theory, large negative shocks cause unemployment in the short run, and the larger the shock, the larger the unemployment. As a result, large shocks can lead to grave social problems, political unrest and, in the worst cases revolution. However, the market is already adjusting itself to return to the new equilibrium, causing job creation and opportunities. If there is no interference to prevent the markets adjusting to the new equilibrium, the markets immediately correct themselves with new firms and full employment, providing workers can acquire the new skills to exploit these new jobs, or are able to move to areas where they can find new employment.\n\nIn response to a shock created by bad government policies, sudden market liberalisation can allow the free markets to reach the equilibrium that the bad government policies prevented them reaching. If the response originates in the markets or other external factors, government intervention slows the free market's path to optimal recovery and liberalisation of the economy speed recovery. However, if the shock is large\u2014causing social and political conditions that destroy or prevent the recovery (e.g., revolution)\u2014government intervention to slow the recovery using gradualist policies and spreading the pain is justifiable.\n\n====Imperfect market shocks====\nThe most important type of nearly neoclassical shock is due to [[market failure]] and [[imperfect market]]s. Sudden free market liberalisation in the absence of free market institutions (as was the case in post-Communist states) or in which a Western-style economy is unnecessarily liberalised (e.g. cutting police budgets, removing regulation) are both examples of imperfect market shocks.\n\nThe nature of the imperfect market shock depends on what assumption of the perfect market is voided. The most important assumption for all markets is the idea of [[property rights]]. The free market doesn't just depend on the exchange of commodities, but on the rights to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. Markets are institutions that organize the exchange of control of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities. Property rights are the most important because they can have the most dramatic effect on the results, and are thought to be behind the most important causes of market failure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother important assumption is [[perfect competition]], which has many smaller assumptions tied to it. These include perfect information, no barriers to entry and many competitors. Again, there are different imperfect markets depending on what assumption is relaxed.\n\nMany competitors assumes that there is more than one firm producing any commodity. In the event of large-scale privatisation of a state-owned company as part of shock therapy, privatising such a company without waiting for a competitor creates a monopoly where the company can use its pre-eminent position to create barriers to entry, control prices and maintain its monopoly.<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/> Also, in post-authoritarian systems with fragile legal and democratic systems, such pre-eminent companies can also influence the government and the legal system to help maintain its monopoly.\n\n''[[Perfect information]]'' assumes that prices and product quality is known to all consumers and producers. The idea of ''imperfect information'' (most commonly called ''[[information asymmetry]])'' has many ramifications for markets. The most important one concerning shock therapy is international trade and financial liberalisation. Because international banks possess better information about other international firms than they do about local firms in a country (and local banks possess better information about other local firms), liberalisation of trade and finance never leads to an even playing field for local firms if international investment is high.<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/> [[Hernando de Soto Polar]] also notes that in conjunction with imperfect property rights, local firms may not be able to access foreign capital when borrowing against their own capital, which may have imperfect property rights (his so-called ''dead capital''), while local lenders know more about the conditions under which something is owned and can be borrowed against.\n\n=====Imperfect market failure in Russia=====\nProminent economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] ties all these ideas together to explain the reason why shock therapy failed in Russia.\n\nThrough the idea of property rights, Stiglitz uses the idea of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]] to explain that, in the presence of severe corruption, a lack of institutionalized law and order and artificially depressed exchange rates, the free market created by shock therapy in Russia created a race to the bottom to asset strip the country and remove the capital abroad, rather than the mutually beneficial race to control the market in commodities that would otherwise happen. Competition meant that if the nominal owner of the capital didn't asset strip the capital first, someone else would.<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/>\n\nLikewise, with the previously large Soviet nationalised industries being privatised quickly created a situation where major markets operated in a monopoly owned by a few individuals (the [[Russian oligarchs]]) who had links with the government of [[Boris Yeltsin]].\n\n=====Illusionary shock=====\nIllusion therapy refers to the imposition of shock economic policies on economy in a way that the society doesn't feel the shock or assumes that the dramatic change in policies is not as shocking or radical as it is in the real world.<ref name=\"illusion\" /> The situation of \"illusion\" can be created using a wide range of sociopolitical tools and techniques including information blackout on national statistics, imposing repeated false news shocks before the final shock (to decrease the social sensitivity or to habituate the people to the future shock), spreading misinformation, rewarding the society with interim exogenous rents and promoting them as the benefits of the shock, etc. Illusion therapy is used to soften or elude the potential social backlash during the shock. The first experience of illusion therapy has been documented after the implementation of Iran's subsidy reform project.<ref name=\"illusion\" />\n\n==People==\n* [[Ludwig Erhard]], architect of the [[West German]] post-War recovery\n* [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], architect of shock therapy in [[Bolivia]]\n* [[Jeffrey Sachs]], chief economic proponent of shock therapy\n* [[Leszek Balcerowicz]], architect of [[Balcerowicz Plan]] for shock therapy in [[Poland]]\n* [[Yegor Gaidar]], architect of shock therapy in [[Russia]]\n* [[Joseph Stiglitz]], a critic of shock therapy, increasing the prominence of corruption through Oligarchs [[Russia]]\n\n==Economic plans==\n* Bolivian [[Decree 21060]], the original shock therapy reforms in Bolivia\n* Economy and Free Market reforms in [[Chile under Pinochet]], a.k.a. the [[Miracle of Chile]]\n* [[Balcerowicz Plan]]\n* [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]] and the [[History of post-Soviet Russia]]\n* Fujishock, reform in Peru during the presidency of [[Alberto Fujimori]]\n* [[Reaganomics]]\n* [[Rogernomics]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Political economy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"PBS\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ufd_shocktherapy_full.html Up for Debate: Shock Therapy: Bolivia, Poland, Russia.

In her 2007 book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'', she argues that [[neoliberal]] [[free market]] policies (as advocated by the economist [[Milton Friedman]]) have risen to prominence in some developed countries because of a deliberate strategy of \"shock therapy\". [[Johan Norberg]] of the [[Cato Institute]] criticized the book, saying that the concept of shock therapy is falsely attributed to Friedman. According to Norberg, Friedman's quote (\"Only a crisis\u2014actual or perceived\u2014produces real change\") is taken out of context and misinterpreted.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/bp102.pdf | title=The Klein Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Polemics | accessdate= August 28, 2008 |publisher= [[Cato Institute]]}}</ref>\n\nThe economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] (sometimes credited with coining the term) says he never picked the term \"shock therapy\", does not much like it, and asserts that the term \"was something that was overlaid by journalism and public discussion\" and that the term \"sounds a lot more painful in a way than what it is\".

It faced war damage to its economy and the problems of mass migration due to the expulsion of ethnic Germans from areas east of the Oder-Neisse Line.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nApril 1945 to July 1947 saw the Allied occupation of Germany implement [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directive 1067 ([[JCS 1067]]). This directive aimed to transfer Germany's economy from one centred on heavy industry to a pastoral one to prevent Germany from having the capacity for war. Civilian industries that might have military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's ''approved peacetime needs'', which were set on the average European standard. To achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements. In May 1946, the first plan stated that German heavy industry must be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants. Restrictions on steel followed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIt soon became obvious that this policy was not sustainable. Germany could not grow enough food for itself and malnutrition was becoming increasingly common. The European post-war economic recovery did not materialise and it became increasingly obvious that the European economy had depended on German industry.<ref name=\"WikiMorgenthau\" />\n\nIn July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \"national security grounds\" the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.\" It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that \"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"<ref name=\"TimePdP\" />\n\nBy 1948, Germany suffered from rampant hyperinflation. The currency of the time (the [[Reichsmark]]) had no public confidence, and thanks to that and price controls, [[black market]] trading boomed and bartering proliferated. Banks were over their heads in debt and surplus currency abounded.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\nHowever, thanks to the introduction of JCS 1779 and the first Allied attempts to set up German governance, something could be done about this. [[Ludwig Erhard]], an economist, who had spent much time working on the problem of post war recovery, had worked his way up the administration created by the occupying American forces until he became the Director of Economics in the [[Bizone|Bizonal]] Economic Council in the joint British and American occupied zones (which later, with the addition of the French occupied territory, became the basis for West Germany). He was placed in charge of currency reform and became a central figure in events that were to follow.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Economic reforms====\nIn spring of 1948, the Allies decided to reform the currency. In preparation for this, a new central bank system was established in West Germany with independent Land Central Banks and the Bank deutscher Lander with headquarters in Frankfurt am Main.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nCurrency reform took effect on June 20, 1948, through the introduction of the [[Deutsche Mark]] to replace the [[Reichsmark]] and by transferring to the Bank deutscher Lander the sole right to print money. Each person received a per capita allowance of 60 DM, payable in two installments (40 DM and 20 DM) and business quota of 60 DM per employee. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nUnder the [[Deutsche Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|German Currency Conversion Law]] on 27 June, private non-bank credit balances were converted at a rate of 10 RM to 1 DM, with half remaining in a frozen bank account. Although the money stock was very small in terms of national product, the adjustment in the price structure immediately led to sharp price increases, fuelled by the high velocity of money through the system. As a result, on 4 October, the military governments wiped out 70% of the remaining frozen balances, resulting in an effective exchange of 10:0.65. Holders of financial assets (including many small-time savers) were dispossessed and the banks' debt in Reichsmarks was eliminated, transferred instead into claims on the Lander and later the Federal Government. Wages, rents, pensions and other recurring liabilities were transferred at 1:1.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nOn the day of the currency reform, [[Ludwig Erhard]] announced, despite the reservations of the Allies, that rationing would be considerably relaxed and price controls abolished.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\n====Results====\nIn the short term, the currency reforms and abolition of price controls helped end hyperinflation. The new currency enjoyed considerable confidence and was accepted by the public as a medium of payment. The currency reforms had ensured that money was once more scarce, and the relaxation of price controls created incentives for production, sales and earning this money. The removal of price controls also meant shops filled up with goods again, which was a huge psychological factor in the adoption of the new currency.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\nIn the long term, these reforms helped set the stage for the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (German for economic miracle) in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Chile 1975===\nChile's reforms under the government of [[Augusto Pinochet]] are held as the origin of neoliberal shock therapy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Economic reforms====\nThe government welcomed foreign investment and eliminated protectionist [[trade barriers]], forcing Chilean businesses to compete with imports on an equal footing, or else go out of business. The main copper company, [[Codelco]], remained in government hands due the nationalization of copper completed by [[Salvador Allende]], however, private companies were allowed to explore and develop new mines. Copper resources were, however, declared \"inalienable\" by the 1980 Constitution.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the short term, the reforms stabilised the economy.\n\nIn the long term, Chile has had higher GDP growth than its neighbouring countries, but also high [[gini index]], expressed in a noticeable inequality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Bolivia 1985===\nThe term ''shock therapy'' originates from Bolivia's tackling of hyper-inflation in 1985, and was thought to have been coined by the media.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On 29 August, just three weeks after the election of [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] as President, and the appointment of [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], the architect of shock therapy, as Planning Minister, Decree 21060 was passed. This decree tackled all aspects of the Bolivian economy and ended the hyper-inflation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Background====\nBetween 1979 and 1982, Bolivia was ruled by a series of coups, counter-coups, and caretaker governments, including the notorious dictatorship of [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza Tejada]]. This period of political instability set the stage for the hyperinflation that later crippled the country. In October 1982, the military convened a Congress elected in 1980 to lead choose a new Chief Executive.<ref name=\"WikiBolivia\"/> The country elected [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]], under whose term the galloping hyperinflationary process started. Zuazo received scant support from the political parties or members of congress, most of whom were eager to flex their newly acquired political muscles after so many years of authoritarianism. Zuazo refused to take extra-constitutional powers (as previous military governments had done in similar crises) and concentrated on preserving the democracy instead, shortening his term by one year in response to his unpopularity and the crisis racking his country.<ref name=\"Zuazo\"/> On 6 August 1985, President [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] was elected. He appointed his President of the Senate, [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], as Planning Minister with a mandate to fix the economy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Prelude to Decree 21060====\n[[Decree 21060]] was the famous decree that covered all aspects of the Bolivian economy, later referred to as shock therapy. In the run-up to the decree, [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] recalls what the new government set out to do:\n\n{{quote|People felt you couldn't stop hyperinflation in a democracy; that you had to have a military government, an authoritarian government to take all these tough steps that had to be taken. Bolivia was the first country to stop hyperinflation in a democracy without depriving people of their civil rights and without violating human rights.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>}}\n\nIn the three weeks between the inauguration of the President and decree 21060, he notes:\n\n{{quote|We spent one week saying, \"Do we really need to do something? Do we really need radical change?\" and then another week debating shock treatment versus gradualism. Finally, we took one week to write it all up.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>}}\n\nOnce they had decided to act, de Lozada recalls that\n\n{{quote|there was a big discussion whether you could stop hyperinflation or inflation, period, by taking gradual steps. Many people said you had to take it slowly. You have to cure the patient. Shock treatment means you have a very sick patient [and] you have to operate before the patient dies. You have to get the cancer out, or you have to stop the infection. That's why we coined the phrase that inflation is like a tiger and you have only one shot; if you don't get it with that one shot, it'll get you. You have a credibility that you have to achieve. If you keep to gradualism, people don't believe you, and the hyperinflation just keeps roaring stronger. So shock therapy is get it over, get it done, stop hyperinflation, and then start rebuilding your economy so you achieve growth.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>}}\n\nIt is notable that de Lozada viewed shock therapy as an issue of political credibility, and less an economic issue as Sachs, its economic pioneer, did. Like Sachs, he was strongly influenced by the German government in 1947, but noted that they, like the new Bolivian government of Victor Paz, were a new government that acted decisively in the first 100 days, resolving the economic situation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Decree 21060====\n{{main|Decree 21060}}\n\nDecree 21060 included the following measures:\n* Allowing the peso to float.\n* Ending price controls and eliminating subsidies to the public sector.\n* Cutting two thirds of the employees of the state oil and tin companies. Freezing the pay of the remaining employees and public sector workers.\n* Liberalising import tariffs by imposing a uniform 20% tariff.\n* Stopping the payment of foreign debt under a deal negotiated with the IMF.\n\n====Results====\nIn the short term, the decree smothered hyperinflation. Within a few months, inflation had dropped to between 10 and 20 percent. The crash of the tin market in October of the same year and the reforms led to an estimated unemployment rate of 21.5 percent by 1987 (the unemployment rate had risen steadily from 5.5 percent in 1978 to 10.9 percent in 1982, 15.5 percent in 1984, and 20 percent in 1986).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Post-Communist states===\nThe next important chapter in the history of shock therapy was the collapse of communism in Europe in 1989. This left many post-communist states in central and eastern Europe with centralised authoritarian economies that had to transition to decentralised, market-orientated capitalist economies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nInspired by [[Bolivia]]'s example, and advised by institutions like the [[International Monetary Fund]] and individuals like [[Jeffrey Sachs]], many countries chose shock therapy to shake off the economic lethargy of the [[communism|communist]] era and transition to the capitalist systems. These transitions provide an interesting and important view into shock therapy and its consequences, especially when contrasted with [[China]], which began a gradualist transition (the opposite of the shock therapy approach) in 1978 under [[Deng Xiaoping]].\n\nAdvocates of shock therapy view [[Poland]] as the success story of shock therapy in the post-communist states and point out that shock therapy was not applied appropriately in [[Russia]], while critics point out that Poland's reforms were the most gradualist of all the countries and compare China's reforms with those of Russia<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/> and their vastly different effects.\n\n====Background====\n\nAfter the failure of the Communist government in the elections of June 4, 1989, it became clear that the previous regime was no longer legitimate. The unofficial talks at Magdalenka and then the [[Polish Round Table]] talks of 1989 allowed for a peaceful transition of power to the democratically elected government.\n\nThe economic situation was that inflation was high, peaking at around 600%, and the majority of state-owned monopolies and holdings were largely ineffective and completely obsolete in terms of technology. Although there was practically no unemployment in Poland, wages were low and the [[shortage economy]] led to a lack of even the most basic foodstuffs in the shops. Unlike the other post-communist countries, however, Poland did have some experience with a capitalist economy, as there was still private property in agriculture and food was still sold in farmers' markets.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\nIn September 1989 a commission of experts was formed under the presidency of Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's leading economist, Minister of Finance and deputy [[Premier of Poland]]. Among the members of the commission were Jeffrey Sachs, [[Stanis\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], [[Stefan Kawalec]] and [[Wojciech Misi\u0105g]]. The commission prepared a plan of extensive reforms that were to enable fast transformation of Poland's economy from obsolete and ineffective central planning to advanced capitalism, as adopted by the states of Western Europe and America.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Balcerowicz Plan====\n\n{{main|Balcerowicz Plan}}\n\nOn October 6 the program was presented on public television and in December the [[Sejm]] passed a packet of 11 acts, all of which were signed by the president on December 31, 1989. These were:\n\n# ''Act on Financial Economy Within State-owned Companies'', which allowed for state-owned businesses to declare bankruptcy and ended the fiction by which companies were able to exist even if their effectiveness and accountability was close to none.\n# ''Act on Banking Law'', which forbade financing the state [[budget deficit]] by the national [[central bank]] and forbade the issue of new currency.\n# ''Act on Credits'', which abolished the preferential laws on credits for state-owned companies and tied [[interest rate]]s to [[inflation]].\n# ''Act on Taxation of Excessive Wage Rise'', introducing the so-called [[popiwek|popiwek tax]] limiting the wage increase in state-owned companies in order to limit [[hyperinflation]].\n# ''Act on New Rules of Taxation'', introducing common taxation for all companies and abolishing special taxes that could previously have been applied to private companies through means of administrative decision.\n# ''Act on Economic Activity of Foreign Investors'', allowing foreign companies and private people to invest in Poland and export their profits abroad.\n# ''Act on Foreign Currencies'', introducing internal exchangeability of the [[z\u0142oty]] and abolishing the state monopoly in international trade.\n# ''Act on Customs Law'', creating a uniform customs rate for all companies.\n# ''Act on Employment'', regulating the duties of unemployment agencies.\n# ''Act on Special Circumstances Under Which a Worker Could be Laid Off'', protecting the workers of state firms from being fired in large numbers and guaranteeing unemployment grants and severance pay.\n\nPrivatization of companies was left until later.\n\n====Results====\n\nIn the short term, the reforms smothered the building hyperinflation before it reached high levels,<ref name=\"PolBalLec\"/> ended food shortages, restored goods on the shelves of shops and halved the absence of employees in the work place.<ref name=\"PolTime\"/> However, the reforms also caused many state companies to close at once, leaving their workers unemployed, and government statistics show this change as unemployment rose from 0.3% in January 1990 (just after the reforms) to 6.5% by the end of that year,<ref name=\"GUSUnemployment\"/> and a shrinking in the GDP for the next two consecutive years by 9.78% in the first and 7.02% (see main article).\n\nIn the long term, the reforms paved the way for economic recovery, with the GDP growing steadily to about 6\u20137% between 1995\u20137, falling to a low of 1.2% in 2001 before rising back up to the 6\u20137% region by 2007,<ref name=\"PolGDP\"/> often led by small service businesses, long suppressed by the Communist government.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/> However, despite GDP indicating prosperity for Poland, the unemployment rate continued to rise steadily, peaking at 16.9% in July 1994 before steadily falling down to a low of 9.5% in August 1998 before rising once more to a high of 20.7% in February 2003, from which it had fallen until the year 2008.<ref name=\"GUSUnemployment\"/> During the early years, the unemployment rate is thought to have been lower due to many of those claiming unemployment working in the grey (informal) economy, although this can account for no more than 5% of the unemployment rate.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/>\n\nThe long-term results of shock therapy point to both a rise and a fall{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} in living standards. Ownership of consumables (cars, TVs, VCRs, washing machines, refrigerators, personal computers, etc.) boomed, as did consumption of fruit and vegetables, meat and fish.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/> However, the huge economic adjustment Poland underwent created massive anxiety.<ref name=\"PolSachs95\"/>\n\n==Applications==\nThis section records all known applications of shock therapy in the world not mentioned under the history section above.\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe economic reforms of New Zealand's 1984 [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government, collectively known as [[Rogernomics]] (after New Zealand [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Roger Douglas]]), constitute an example of shock therapy.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Toward Better Governance - Public Service Reform in New Zealand (1984-94) and its Relevance to Canada|last = Holmes|first = J.

When economic liberalism came to this nation, the government took Sachs' advice and immediately withdrew regulations, price controls and subsidies to state-owned industries. However, with respect to the privatization of the state sector (which may or may not be considered as part of shock therapy depending on the definition being used) the change was much more gradualist. Whereas many economic factors were immediately applied{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, privatization of state-owned enterprises was delayed until society could safely handle the divestiture, as contrasted with the '[[business oligarch|robber baron]]' state of affairs in [[Russia]].\n\nProductivity increased although at the same time unemployment rates rose as well. As of 2008, the GNP was 77% higher than in 1989.<ref>Suomen Kuvalehti 23/2009</ref> Moreover, inequality in Poland actually decreased right after the economic reforms were implemented, although it rose back up again in later years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/keane.htm|title=Poland Inequality, Transfers, and Growth in Transition|author=[[Michael Keane (economist)|Michael P.

Hyperinflations see a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and the [[velocity of money]]. Either one, or both of these together, is the root cause of hyperinflation and in both models, one follows from the other.\n\nIn the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent\u2014whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless, they want to spend them in preference to holding notes that will lose value. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic Vienna, and capital flight, sometimes because of \"contagion\" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself. A crisis of confidence is particularly damaging to a [[fiat money|fiat currency]] (i.e. most modern currencies), a currency whose value is unrelated to any physical quantity, as fiat money is typically backed by future tax revenues and its (typically exclusive) acceptability to the government for payment of taxes and charges.\n\nIn the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When businesspeople perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot \"win\" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.\n\nEnding hyperinflation depends on which model is the main cause. In the confidence model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency\u2014often by issuing a completely new one. Also, if possible, any action that restores confidence in the government can help end the hyperinflation (e.g. the psychological effect of food in the shops after shortages in most hyperinflations, the election of a new government both capable of and dedicated to tackling the problem). In the monetary model, the issuer of the currency must stop expanding the currency.\n\n===Shock therapy as an artificial economic shock===\nA [[shock (economics)|shock]] in economics is defined as an unexpected or unpredictable event that affects an economy, either positively or negatively. Recessions are often modelled as negative economic shocks in which the current state of the economy is untenable and the economy tries to restore itself to a new equilibrium position. In the [[short-run]], as the economy adjusts to the shock but before it reaches the new equilibrium, the shock often causes productivity to fall, unemployment rise,<ref name=\"EconomicsForDummies\"/> and closure of firms that are now non-viable in the new environment. The new environment enables new kinds of businesses and people must learn new skills and exploit new opportunities to achieve [[long-run]] equilibrium.\n\nShock therapy can be largely understood by thinking of it as an artificial shock imposed by government policies. [[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical theory]] provides a very useful tool in trying to describe an artificial shock theoretically, in that neoclassical theory provides an idealised view of an economy based on certain assumptions, most of which are made true through market institutions (often but not necessarily provided by the government), law, culture or historical practise, and is very useful in explaining most situations (especially in modern Westernised economies). Even when some of the assumptions required for neoclassical theory are not in place resulting in an [[imperfect market]] and the results of neoclassical theory becoming distorted or failing, comparing the result with neoclassical theory can prove useful. Other, slightly different formulations of economic thought strive to describe shocks, the most important of which is [[economic liberalism]].\n\n====Neoclassical shocks====\nIn neoclassical theory, large negative shocks cause unemployment in the short run, and the larger the shock, the larger the unemployment. As a result, large shocks can lead to grave social problems, political unrest and, in the worst cases revolution. However, the market is already adjusting itself to return to the new equilibrium, causing job creation and opportunities. If there is no interference to prevent the markets adjusting to the new equilibrium, the markets immediately correct themselves with new firms and full employment, providing workers can acquire the new skills to exploit these new jobs, or are able to move to areas where they can find new employment.\n\nIn response to a shock created by bad government policies, sudden market liberalisation can allow the free markets to reach the equilibrium that the bad government policies prevented them reaching. If the response originates in the markets or other external factors, government intervention slows the free market's path to optimal recovery and liberalisation of the economy speed recovery. However, if the shock is large\u2014causing social and political conditions that destroy or prevent the recovery (e.g., revolution)\u2014government intervention to slow the recovery using gradualist policies and spreading the pain is justifiable.\n\n====Imperfect market shocks====\nThe most important type of nearly neoclassical shock is due to [[market failure]] and [[imperfect market]]s. Sudden free market liberalisation in the absence of free market institutions (as was the case in post-Communist states) or in which a Western-style economy is unnecessarily liberalised (e.g. cutting police budgets, removing regulation) are both examples of imperfect market shocks.\n\nThe nature of the imperfect market shock depends on what assumption of the perfect market is voided. The most important assumption for all markets is the idea of [[property rights]]. The free market doesn't just depend on the exchange of commodities, but on the rights to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. Markets are institutions that organize the exchange of control of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities. Property rights are the most important because they can have the most dramatic effect on the results, and are thought to be behind the most important causes of market failure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother important assumption is [[perfect competition]], which has many smaller assumptions tied to it. These include perfect information, no barriers to entry and many competitors. Again, there are different imperfect markets depending on what assumption is relaxed.\n\nMany competitors assumes that there is more than one firm producing any commodity. In the event of large-scale privatisation of a state-owned company as part of shock therapy, privatising such a company without waiting for a competitor creates a monopoly where the company can use its pre-eminent position to create barriers to entry, control prices and maintain its monopoly.<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/> Also, in post-authoritarian systems with fragile legal and democratic systems, such pre-eminent companies can also influence the government and the legal system to help maintain its monopoly.\n\n''[[Perfect information]]'' assumes that prices and product quality is known to all consumers and producers. The idea of ''imperfect information'' (most commonly called ''[[information asymmetry]])'' has many ramifications for markets. The most important one concerning shock therapy is international trade and financial liberalisation. Because international banks possess better information about other international firms than they do about local firms in a country (and local banks possess better information about other local firms), liberalisation of trade and finance never leads to an even playing field for local firms if international investment is high.<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/> [[Hernando de Soto Polar]] also notes that in conjunction with imperfect property rights, local firms may not be able to access foreign capital when borrowing against their own capital, which may have imperfect property rights (his so-called ''dead capital''), while local lenders know more about the conditions under which something is owned and can be borrowed against.\n\n=====Imperfect market failure in Russia=====\nProminent economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] ties all these ideas together to explain the reason why shock therapy failed in Russia.\n\nThrough the idea of property rights, Stiglitz uses the idea of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]] to explain that, in the presence of severe corruption, a lack of institutionalized law and order and artificially depressed exchange rates, the free market created by shock therapy in Russia created a race to the bottom to asset strip the country and remove the capital abroad, rather than the mutually beneficial race to control the market in commodities that would otherwise happen. Competition meant that if the nominal owner of the capital didn't asset strip the capital first, someone else would.<ref name=\"StiglitzDiscontents\"/>\n\nLikewise, with the previously large Soviet nationalised industries being privatised quickly created a situation where major markets operated in a monopoly owned by a few individuals (the [[Russian oligarchs]]) who had links with the government of [[Boris Yeltsin]].\n\n=====Illusionary shock=====\nIllusion therapy refers to the imposition of shock economic policies on economy in a way that the society doesn't feel the shock or assumes that the dramatic change in policies is not as shocking or radical as it is in the real world.<ref name=\"illusion\" /> The situation of \"illusion\" can be created using a wide range of sociopolitical tools and techniques including information blackout on national statistics, imposing repeated false news shocks before the final shock (to decrease the social sensitivity or to habituate the people to the future shock), spreading misinformation, rewarding the society with interim exogenous rents and promoting them as the benefits of the shock, etc. Illusion therapy is used to soften or elude the potential social backlash during the shock. The first experience of illusion therapy has been documented after the implementation of Iran's subsidy reform project.<ref name=\"illusion\" />\n\n==People==\n* [[Ludwig Erhard]], architect of the [[West German]] post-War recovery\n* [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]], architect of shock therapy in [[Bolivia]]\n* [[Jeffrey Sachs]], chief economic proponent of shock therapy\n* [[Leszek Balcerowicz]], architect of [[Balcerowicz Plan]] for shock therapy in [[Poland]]\n* [[Yegor Gaidar]], architect of shock therapy in [[Russia]]\n* [[Joseph Stiglitz]], a critic of shock therapy, increasing the prominence of corruption through Oligarchs [[Russia]]\n\n==Economic plans==\n* Bolivian [[Decree 21060]], the original shock therapy reforms in Bolivia\n* Economy and Free Market reforms in [[Chile under Pinochet]], a.k.a. the [[Miracle of Chile]]\n* [[Balcerowicz Plan]]\n* [[Economy of Russia|Russia under Yeltsin]] and the [[History of post-Soviet Russia]]\n* Fujishock, reform in Peru during the presidency of [[Alberto Fujimori]]\n* [[Reaganomics]]\n* [[Rogernomics]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Political economy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"PBS\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ufd_shocktherapy_full.html Up for Debate: Shock Therapy: Bolivia, Poland, Russia.

The miasmatic position was that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infection was not passed between individuals but would affect individuals within the locale that gave rise to such vapors. It was identifiable by its foul smell. It was also initially believed that miasmas were propagated through worms from ulcers within those affected by a plague.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mias\n\nThe miasmatic theory of disease remained popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and a sense of ''effluvia'' contributed to Robert Boyle's ''[[Suspicions about the Hidden Realities of the Air]]''.\n\nIn the 1850s, miasma was used to explain the spread of [[cholera]] in [[London]] and in [[Paris]], partly justifying [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmann's later renovation of the French capital]].

Miasma has different names in Chinese culture. Most of the explanations of miasma refer to it as a kind of sickness, or poison gas.\n\nThe ancient Chinese thought that miasma was related to the environment of parts of Southern China. The miasma was thought to be caused by the heat, moisture and the dead air in the Southern Chinese mountains. They thought that insects\u2019 waste polluted the air, the fog, and the water, and the virgin forest harbored a great environment for miasma to occur.\n\nIn descriptions by ancient travelers, soldiers, or local officials (most of them are men of letters) of the phenomenon of miasma, fog, haze, dust, gas, or poison geological gassing were always mentioned. The miasma was thought to have caused a lot of diseases such as the cold, influenza, heat strokes, [[malaria]], or dysentery. In the medical history of China, malaria had been referred to by different names in different dynasty periods. Poisoning and [[psittacosis]] were also called miasma in ancient China because they did not accurately understand the cause of disease.\n\nIn the [[Sui dynasty]], doctor Tsao Yuan-fung mentioned miasma in his book ''On Pathogen and Syndromes'' ([[:zh:\u8af8\u75c5\u6e90\u5019\u8ad6|\u8af8\u75c5\u6e90\u5019\u8ad6]]). He thought that miasma in Southern China was similar to [[typhoid fever]] in Northern China. However, in his opinion, miasma was different from malaria and [[dysentery]]. In his book, he discussed dysentery in another chapter, and malaria in a single chapter. He also claimed that miasma caused various diseases, so he suggested that one should find apt and specific ways to resolve problems.<ref>(\u968b)\u5de2\u5143\u65b9\u64b0\uff0c\u66f9\u8d64\u96fb\u70b3\u7ae0\u5708\u9ede\uff0c\u300a\u5de2\u6c0f\u8af8\u75c5\u6e90\u5019\u8ad6\u300b\uff0c(\u53f0\u5317\uff1a\u570b\u7acb\u4e2d\u570b\u91ab\u85e5\u7814\u7a76\u6240\uff0c1996)\uff0c\u980130\u300147\u201351\u3002</ref>\n\nThe concept of miasma developed in several stages. First, before the Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]], the concept of miasma was gradually forming; at least, in the Eastern [[Han Dynasty]], there was no description of miasma. During the Eastern Jin, large numbers of northern people moved south, and miasma was then recognized by men of letters and nobility. After the Sui and the [[Tang Dynasty]], scholars-bureaucrats sent to be the local officials recorded and investigated miasma. As a result, the government became concerned about the severe cases and the causes of miasma by sending doctors to the areas of epidemic to research the disease and heal the patients. In the [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]], versions of local chronicles record different miasma in different places.<ref name=\"ntnu_miasma\">\u725f\u91cd\u884c\uff0c\u738b\u5f69\u840d\uff0c\u3008\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u300c\u7634\u6c23\u300d\u8003\u91cb\u3009\uff0c\u300a\u570b\u7acb\u81fa\u7063\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5927\u5b78\u5730\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5831\u544a\u300b\uff0c(\u7b2c38\u671f\uff0c\u53f0\u5317\uff1a\u570b\u7acb\u81fa\u7063\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5927\u5b78\u5730\u7406\u5b78\u7cfb\uff0c2003)\uff0c\u980125\u3002 {{cite web |url=http://www1.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/download.php?filename=43_d78d35f8.pdf&dir=archive&title=Download |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224357/http://www1.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/download.php?filename=43_d78d35f8.pdf&dir=archive&title=Download |archivedate=2012-03-25 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Southern China was highly developed in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

Most scholars of the time agreed that the geological environments in the south had a direct impact on the population composition and growth. Many historical records reflect that females were less prone to miasma infection, and mortality rates were much higher in the south, especially for the men. This directly influenced agriculture cultivation and the southern economy, as men were the engine of agriculture production. Zhou Qufei (\u5468\u53bb\u975e), a local magistrate from the [[Southern Song Dynasty]] described in his treatise, ''[[Lingwai Daida|Representative Answers from the South]]'': \"...

Miasmata were believed to come from rotting vegetation and foul water\u2014especially in [[swamp]]s and urban [[ghetto]]s.\n\nMany people, especially the weak or infirm, avoided breathing night air by going indoors and keeping windows and doors shut. In addition to ideas associated with zymotic theory, there was also a general fear that cold or cool air spread disease. The fear of night air gradually disappeared as understanding about disease increased as well as with improvements in home heating and ventilation. Particularly important was the understanding that the agent spreading [[malaria]] was the [[mosquito]] (active at night) rather than miasmata.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Peter C|title=How Night Air Became Good Air, 1776\u20131930|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.3/baldwin.html|journal=Environmental History|date=July 2003|volume=8|issue=3|pages=412\u2013429|doi=10.2307/3986202|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040411214207/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.3/baldwin.html|archive-date=2004-04-11|url-status=live|jstor=3986202}}\n</ref><ref>Cipolla, Carlo M.

Throughout the 19th century, the medical community was divided on the explanation for disease proliferation.  On one side were the contagionists, believing disease was passed through physical contact, while others believed disease was present in the air in the form of miasma, and thus could proliferate without physical contact.  Two members of the latter group were Dr. Thomas S. Smith and Florence Nightingale.\n\n[[Thomas Southwood Smith]] spent many years comparing the miasmatic theory to contagionism.\n\n{{quote|To assume the method of propagation by touch, whether by the person or of infected articles, and to overlook that by the corruption of the air, is at once to increase the real danger, from exposure to noxious effluvia, and to divert attention from the true means of remedy and prevention.}}\n\n[[Florence Nightingale]]:\n\n{{quote|The idea of \"contagion\", as explaining the spread of disease, appears to have been adopted at a time when, from the neglect of sanitary arrangements, epidemics attacked whole masses of people, and when men had ceased to consider that nature had any laws for her guidance. Beginning with the poets and historians, the word finally made its way into scientific nomenclature, where it has remained ever since [...] a satisfactory explanation for pestilence and an adequate excuse for non-exertion to prevent its recurrence.}}\n\nThe current germ theory accounts for disease proliferation by both direct and indirect physical contact.<ref name=\"ebscohost.com\"/>\n\n===Influence on sanitary engineering reforms===<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The insidious foe sewer gas.jpg|thumb|\u201cAll smell is disease.\u201d]] -->\nIn the early 19th century, the living conditions in industrialized cities in Britain were increasingly unsanitary. The population was growing at a much faster rate than the infrastructure could support. For example, the population of Manchester doubled within a single decade, leading to overcrowding and a significant increase in waste accumulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cholera and the fight for Public Health Reform in Mid-Victorian England|last = Gill|first = Geoff|date = 2000|journal = Historian|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The miasma theory of disease made sense to the sanitary reformers of the mid-19th century. Miasmas explained why [[cholera]] and other diseases were epidemic in places where the water was stagnant and foul-smelling. A leading sanitary reformer, London's [[Edwin Chadwick]], asserted that \"all smell is disease\", and maintained that a fundamental change in the structure of sanitation systems was needed to combat increasing urban mortality rates.\n\nChadwick saw the problem cholera and typhoid epidemics as being directly related to urbanization, and he proposed that new, independent sewerage systems should be connected to homes. Chadwick supported his proposal with reports from the [[Royal Statistical Society|London Statistical Society]] which showed dramatic increases in both morbidity and mortality rates since the beginning of urbanization in the early 19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Though Chadwick proposed reform on the basis of the miasma theory, his proposals did contribute to improvements in [[sanitation]], such as preventing the reflux of noxious air from sewers back into houses by using separate drainage systems in the design of [[sanitation]]. That led, incidentally, to decreased outbreaks of [[cholera]] and thus helped to support the theory.<ref>{{cite journal |first=James |last=Whorton |journal=[[Western Journal of Medicine|West. J.

However, it was inconsistent with the findings arising from [[microbiology]] and [[bacteriology]] in the later 19th century, which eventually led to the adoption of the [[germ theory of disease]], although consensus was not reached immediately. Concerns over [[sewer gas]], which was a major component of the miasma theory developed by [[Galen]], and brought to prominence by the \"[[Great Stink]]\" in London in the summer of 1858, led proponents of the theory to observe that sewers enclosed the refuse of the human bowel, which medical science had discovered could teem with [[typhoid]], [[cholera]], and other [[microorganism|microbes]].\n\nIn 1846, the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act<ref name=\"public_health\" /> was passed to identify whether the transmission of cholera was by air or by water.

The system helped purify London's water and saved the city from epidemics. In 1866, the last of the three great British cholera\nepidemics took hold in a small area of [[Whitechapel]].

During the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|cholera epidemic of 1854]], Snow traced high mortality rates among the citizens of [[Soho]] to a water pump in [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]]. Snow convinced the local government to remove the pump handle, which resulted in a marked decrease in cases of cholera in the area. In 1857, Snow submitted a paper to the [[British Medical Journal]] which attributed high numbers of cholera cases to water sources that were contaminated with human waste. Snow used statistical data to show that citizens who received their water from upstream sources were considerably less likely to develop cholera than those who received their water from downstream sources.  Though his research supported his hypothesis that contaminated water, not foul air, was the source of cholera\nepidemics, a review committee concluded that Snow's findings were not significant enough to warrant change, and they were summarily dismissed. Additionally, other interests intervened in the process of reform. Many water companies and civic authorities pumped water directly from contaminated sources such as the Thames to public wells, and the idea of changing sources or implementing filtration techniques was an unattractive economic prospect. In the face of such economic interests, reform was slow to be adopted.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1855, [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] made a testimony against the Amendment to the \"Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act\" that regularized air pollution of some industries. He claimed that:\n\n{{quote|That is possible; but I believe that the poison of the cholera is either swallowed in water, or got directly from some other person in the family, or in the room; I believe it is quite an exception for it to be conveyed in the air; though if the matter gets dry it may be wafted a short distance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snows_testimony.html|title=Snow's Testimony|first=Ralph R.|last=Frerichs|website=www.ph.ucla.edu|accessdate=15 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603143829/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snows_testimony.html|archivedate=3 June 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the same year, [[William Farr]], who was then the major supporter of the Miasma Theory, issued a report to criticize the germ theory.

Miasma has different names in Chinese culture. Most of the explanations of miasma refer to it as a kind of sickness, or poison gas.\n\nThe ancient Chinese thought that miasma was related to the environment of parts of Southern China. The miasma was thought to be caused by the heat, moisture and the dead air in the Southern Chinese mountains. They thought that insects\u2019 waste polluted the air, the fog, and the water, and the virgin forest harbored a great environment for miasma to occur.\n\nIn descriptions by ancient travelers, soldiers, or local officials (most of them are men of letters) of the phenomenon of miasma, fog, haze, dust, gas, or poison geological gassing were always mentioned. The miasma was thought to have caused a lot of diseases such as the cold, influenza, heat strokes, [[malaria]], or dysentery. In the medical history of China, malaria had been referred to by different names in different dynasty periods. Poisoning and [[psittacosis]] were also called miasma in ancient China because they did not accurately understand the cause of disease.\n\nIn the [[Sui dynasty]], doctor Tsao Yuan-fung mentioned miasma in his book ''On Pathogen and Syndromes'' ([[:zh:\u8af8\u75c5\u6e90\u5019\u8ad6|\u8af8\u75c5\u6e90\u5019\u8ad6]]). He thought that miasma in Southern China was similar to [[typhoid fever]] in Northern China. However, in his opinion, miasma was different from malaria and [[dysentery]]. In his book, he discussed dysentery in another chapter, and malaria in a single chapter. He also claimed that miasma caused various diseases, so he suggested that one should find apt and specific ways to resolve problems.<ref>(\u968b)\u5de2\u5143\u65b9\u64b0\uff0c\u66f9\u8d64\u96fb\u70b3\u7ae0\u5708\u9ede\uff0c\u300a\u5de2\u6c0f\u8af8\u75c5\u6e90\u5019\u8ad6\u300b\uff0c(\u53f0\u5317\uff1a\u570b\u7acb\u4e2d\u570b\u91ab\u85e5\u7814\u7a76\u6240\uff0c1996)\uff0c\u980130\u300147\u201351\u3002</ref>\n\nThe concept of miasma developed in several stages. First, before the Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]], the concept of miasma was gradually forming; at least, in the Eastern [[Han Dynasty]], there was no description of miasma. During the Eastern Jin, large numbers of northern people moved south, and miasma was then recognized by men of letters and nobility. After the Sui and the [[Tang Dynasty]], scholars-bureaucrats sent to be the local officials recorded and investigated miasma. As a result, the government became concerned about the severe cases and the causes of miasma by sending doctors to the areas of epidemic to research the disease and heal the patients.

Most scholars of the time agreed that the geological environments in the south had a direct impact on the population composition and growth. Many historical records reflect that females were less prone to miasma infection, and mortality rates were much higher in the south, especially for the men. This directly influenced agriculture cultivation and the southern economy, as men were the engine of agriculture production. Zhou Qufei (\u5468\u53bb\u975e), a local magistrate from the [[Southern Song Dynasty]] described in his treatise, ''[[Lingwai Daida|Representative Answers from the South]]'': \"...

Miasmata were believed to come from rotting vegetation and foul water\u2014especially in [[swamp]]s and urban [[ghetto]]s.\n\nMany people, especially the weak or infirm, avoided breathing night air by going indoors and keeping windows and doors shut. In addition to ideas associated with zymotic theory, there was also a general fear that cold or cool air spread disease. The fear of night air gradually disappeared as understanding about disease increased as well as with improvements in home heating and ventilation. Particularly important was the understanding that the agent spreading [[malaria]] was the [[mosquito]] (active at night) rather than miasmata.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Peter C|title=How Night Air Became Good Air, 1776\u20131930|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.3/baldwin.html|journal=Environmental History|date=July 2003|volume=8|issue=3|pages=412\u2013429|doi=10.2307/3986202|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040411214207/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.3/baldwin.html|archive-date=2004-04-11|url-status=live|jstor=3986202}}\n</ref><ref>Cipolla, Carlo M.

Throughout the 19th century, the medical community was divided on the explanation for disease proliferation.  On one side were the contagionists, believing disease was passed through physical contact, while others believed disease was present in the air in the form of miasma, and thus could proliferate without physical contact.  Two members of the latter group were Dr. Thomas S. Smith and Florence Nightingale.\n\n[[Thomas Southwood Smith]] spent many years comparing the miasmatic theory to contagionism.\n\n{{quote|To assume the method of propagation by touch, whether by the person or of infected articles, and to overlook that by the corruption of the air, is at once to increase the real danger, from exposure to noxious effluvia, and to divert attention from the true means of remedy and prevention.}}\n\n[[Florence Nightingale]]:\n\n{{quote|The idea of \"contagion\", as explaining the spread of disease, appears to have been adopted at a time when, from the neglect of sanitary arrangements, epidemics attacked whole masses of people, and when men had ceased to consider that nature had any laws for her guidance. Beginning with the poets and historians, the word finally made its way into scientific nomenclature, where it has remained ever since [...] a satisfactory explanation for pestilence and an adequate excuse for non-exertion to prevent its recurrence.}}\n\nThe current germ theory accounts for disease proliferation by both direct and indirect physical contact.<ref name=\"ebscohost.com\"/>\n\n===Influence on sanitary engineering reforms===<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The insidious foe sewer gas.jpg|thumb|\u201cAll smell is disease.\u201d]] -->\nIn the early 19th century, the living conditions in industrialized cities in Britain were increasingly unsanitary. The population was growing at a much faster rate than the infrastructure could support. For example, the population of Manchester doubled within a single decade, leading to overcrowding and a significant increase in waste accumulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cholera and the fight for Public Health Reform in Mid-Victorian England|last = Gill|first = Geoff|date = 2000|journal = Historian|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The miasma theory of disease made sense to the sanitary reformers of the mid-19th century. Miasmas explained why [[cholera]] and other diseases were epidemic in places where the water was stagnant and foul-smelling. A leading sanitary reformer, London's [[Edwin Chadwick]], asserted that \"all smell is disease\", and maintained that a fundamental change in the structure of sanitation systems was needed to combat increasing urban mortality rates.\n\nChadwick saw the problem cholera and typhoid epidemics as being directly related to urbanization, and he proposed that new, independent sewerage systems should be connected to homes. Chadwick supported his proposal with reports from the [[Royal Statistical Society|London Statistical Society]] which showed dramatic increases in both morbidity and mortality rates since the beginning of urbanization in the early 19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Though Chadwick proposed reform on the basis of the miasma theory, his proposals did contribute to improvements in [[sanitation]], such as preventing the reflux of noxious air from sewers back into houses by using separate drainage systems in the design of [[sanitation]]. That led, incidentally, to decreased outbreaks of [[cholera]] and thus helped to support the theory.<ref>{{cite journal |first=James |last=Whorton |journal=[[Western Journal of Medicine|West. J.

However, it was inconsistent with the findings arising from [[microbiology]] and [[bacteriology]] in the later 19th century, which eventually led to the adoption of the [[germ theory of disease]], although consensus was not reached immediately. Concerns over [[sewer gas]], which was a major component of the miasma theory developed by [[Galen]], and brought to prominence by the \"[[Great Stink]]\" in London in the summer of 1858, led proponents of the theory to observe that sewers enclosed the refuse of the human bowel, which medical science had discovered could teem with [[typhoid]], [[cholera]], and other [[microorganism|microbes]].\n\nIn 1846, the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act<ref name=\"public_health\" /> was passed to identify whether the transmission of cholera was by air or by water. The act was used to encourage owners to clean their dwellings and connect them to sewers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nEven though eventually disproved by the understanding of [[bacteria]] and the discovery of [[virus]]es, the miasma theory helped establish the connection between poor [[sanitation]] and disease.

Encouraged by the Great Stink, Parliament sanctioned Bazalgette to design and construct a comprehensive system of sewers, which intercepted London's sewage and diverted it away from its water supply. The system helped purify London's water and saved the city from epidemics. In 1866, the last of the three great British cholera\nepidemics took hold in a small area of [[Whitechapel]]. However, the area was not yet connected to Bazalgette's system, and the confined area of the epidemic acted as testament to the efficiency of the system's design.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nYears later, the influence of those sanitary reforms on Britain was described by [[Sir Richard Rogers]]:<ref name=\"SULAIR\"/>\n\n{{quote|London was the first city to create a complex civic administration which could coordinate modern urban services, from public transport to housing, clean water to education.

During the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|cholera epidemic of 1854]], Snow traced high mortality rates among the citizens of [[Soho]] to a water pump in [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]]. Snow convinced the local government to remove the pump handle, which resulted in a marked decrease in cases of cholera in the area. In 1857, Snow submitted a paper to the [[British Medical Journal]] which attributed high numbers of cholera cases to water sources that were contaminated with human waste. Snow used statistical data to show that citizens who received their water from upstream sources were considerably less likely to develop cholera than those who received their water from downstream sources.  Though his research supported his hypothesis that contaminated water, not foul air, was the source of cholera\nepidemics, a review committee concluded that Snow's findings were not significant enough to warrant change, and they were summarily dismissed. Additionally, other interests intervened in the process of reform. Many water companies and civic authorities pumped water directly from contaminated sources such as the Thames to public wells, and the idea of changing sources or implementing filtration techniques was an unattractive economic prospect. In the face of such economic interests, reform was slow to be adopted.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1855, [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] made a testimony against the Amendment to the \"Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act\" that regularized air pollution of some industries. He claimed that:\n\n{{quote|That is possible; but I believe that the poison of the cholera is either swallowed in water, or got directly from some other person in the family, or in the room; I believe it is quite an exception for it to be conveyed in the air; though if the matter gets dry it may be wafted a short distance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snows_testimony.html|title=Snow's Testimony|first=Ralph R.|last=Frerichs|website=www.ph.ucla.edu|accessdate=15 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603143829/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snows_testimony.html|archivedate=3 June 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the same year, [[William Farr]], who was then the major supporter of the Miasma Theory, issued a report to criticize the germ theory.

The regular voice cast consists of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Doug Lawrence]], [[Jill Talley]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]] and [[Lori Alan]]. Most one-off and background characters are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], [[Sirena Irwin]], [[Bob Joles]], [[Mark Fite]] and [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. Throughout the show's run, it has employed numerous guest stars from many ranges of professions. Repeat guests include [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Tim Conway]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Marion Ross]], [[John O'Hurley]] and [[Michael McKean]].\n\n''SpongeBob SquarePants'' chronicles the adventures and endeavors of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Many of the ideas for the show originated in an unpublished, educational comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'', which Hillenburg created in the mid-1980s. He began developing ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', another Nickelodeon animated series which Hillenburg directed. While creating the show, Hillenburg, with colleague [[Derek Drymon]], was also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. He turned to Kenny, who had worked with him on ''Rocko's Modern Life'', to voice the title character.\n\nKenny and Catlett were the first cast members to receive award nominations for their performance on ''SpongeBob SquarePants''. They each received [[Annie Award]] nominations in 2001, but did not win. In 2010, Kenny won the Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in a Television Production, making it the first time a cast member had won this type of award. Bumpass was the first cast member to be nominated for an [[Emmy Award]], receiving a nomination in 2012. In 2018, Kenny won both an Annie Award and an Emmy Award for his performance as SpongeBob.\n\n==Regular cast==\n\n===Background===\n{{Listen\n| filename    = SpongeBob SquarePants - voice sample from Secret Box.ogg\n| title       = Voice of SpongeBob SquarePants\n| description = Audio sample of the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants from the episode \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 2)#ep35a|The Secret Box]]\" (2001).\n| pos         = left\n}}\n[[File:Clancy Brown.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Voice acting veteran [[Clancy Brown]] provides the voice of [[Mr. Krabs]].]]\n[[File:41st Annie Awards, Jill Talley.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Kenny's wife, [[Jill Talley]], voices [[Plankton and Karen#Karen|Karen]].]]\n[[File:Carolyn Lawrence (cropped).jpg|thumb|175px|right|Actress [[Carolyn Lawrence]] voices [[Sandy Cheeks]].]]\n[[File:Dee Bradley Baker by Gage Skidmore 2009.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Dee Bradley Baker]] has appeared in several minor roles.]]\n[[File:Ernest-Borgnine 2004.JPEG|thumb|175px|right|Actor [[Ernest Borgnine]] was a recurring guest star on the show, voicing Mermaid Man from 1999 to his death in 2012.]]\n\n''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has featured the voices of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]],  [[Rodger Bumpass]],  [[Clancy Brown]], [[Mr. Lawrence]], [[Jill Talley]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]] and [[Lori Alan]] since it began.

The company\u2019s services include [[monoclonal]] and [[polyclonal]] antibody and [[antigen]] development, molecular modeling, antibody sequencing and engineering, [[bioreactor]] technology, [[pharmacokinetic]] studies, antibody [[epitope]] binning, [[peptide]] synthesis, [[immunoassay]] development, [[ligand-binding assay]] analysis, and support for [[CAR-T]] research. \n\n==History==\nAntibody Solutions was founded in 1995 by current president, John Kenney, PhD, Judith Kenney, and Dennis and Bette Gould. Dr. Kenney had managed the monoclonal antibody (MAb) development laboratory for Syntex Research ([[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]])  in Palo Alto, Calif., and Gould managed the MAb production facility for Syva Diagnostics. Gould left Antibody Solutions in 1997 and eventually became a vice president for Sepragen Corporation.\n\nKenney and Gould were assisted in the startup of the company by Barry Bredt, who had the foresight to acquire the domain name, [https://www.antibody.com www.antibody.com], for the company. Bredt later became director of the [[University of California at San Francisco]]\u2019s General Clinical Research Center, and was a pioneer of the HIV/AIDS Diagnostics \"EASYCD4.\"<ref>Josefowicz S, Buchner L, Epling CL, Sinclair E, Bredt B.

One of the first independent antibody discovery companies, the firm focused on custom antibody discovery for therapeutics, diagnostics and critical reagents. The company pioneered the use of bioreactors in antibody research by becoming the first CRO to produce antibodies in CELLine flasks in 2000. \n\nAntibody Solutions was headquartered for several years in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], a short distance from [[Shoreline Park, Mountain View|Shoreline Park]], [[Moffett Field]] and the [[Googleplex]].

Dr. Kenney had managed the monoclonal antibody (MAb) development laboratory for Syntex Research ([[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]])  in Palo Alto, Calif., and Gould managed the MAb production facility for Syva Diagnostics. Gould left Antibody Solutions in 1997 and eventually became a vice president for Sepragen Corporation.\n\nKenney and Gould were assisted in the startup of the company by Barry Bredt, who had the foresight to acquire the domain name, [https://www.antibody.com www.antibody.com], for the company. Bredt later became director of the [[University of California at San Francisco]]\u2019s General Clinical Research Center, and was a pioneer of the HIV/AIDS Diagnostics \"EASYCD4.\"<ref>Josefowicz S, Buchner L, Epling CL, Sinclair E, Bredt B.

Debuting on September 17, 2009, it follows the exploits of a dysfunctional intelligence agency, led by [[Sterling Archer]] (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) and seven of his colleagues\u2014Malory Archer ([[Jessica Walter]]), [[Lana Kane]] ([[Aisha Tyler]]), Cyril Figgis ([[Chris Parnell]]), [[Cheryl Tunt]] ([[Judy Greer]]), Pam Poovey ([[Amber Nash]]), Ray Gillette ([[Adam Reed]]) and Dr. Algernop Krieger ([[Lucky Yates]]). ''Archer''{{'s}} premise evolves as the comedy assumes the standard setup of an [[anthology series|anthology]] in later seasons, each with self-contained [[Narrative arc|arcs]], new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor. Beginning with the eighth season in 2017, the show was broadcast on sibling network [[FXX]].\n\n''Archer'' was conceived by Reed shortly after the cancellation of his [[Adult Swim]] comedy ''[[Frisky Dingo]]''. It draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]]. The show's hallmarks include reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and [[meta reference|meta-comedy]]. ''Archer'' is produced using [[limited animation]] and takes its visual style from mid-century comic art. The cast members record their lines individually, and the show regularly employs guest actors and actresses for supporting characters. There have been [[List of Archer episodes|110 episodes]] broadcast in ''Archer''{{'s}} history.\n\n''Archer'' has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and four [[Critics Choice Award]]s. It has also received 15 [[Annie Award]] nominations, among others, for outstanding achievement in animation, writing, direction, and voice acting. ''Archer'' will return to its original setup for the eight-episode eleventh season, as Reed oversees the comedy's production in a reduced role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/19/archer-season-11-interview/|title=FX's Archer renewed for surprise season 11, reveals major changes|last=Hibberd|first=James|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 20, 2019}}</ref> Season eleven was scheduled to premiere on May 6, 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/fx-sets-premiere-dates-for-fargo-mrs-america-better-things-devs-archer-more-tca-1202825595/|title=FX Sets Premiere Dates For \u2018Fargo\u2019, \u2018Mrs. America\u2019, \u2018Better Things\u2019, \u2018Devs\u2019, \u2018Archer\u2019 & More \u2013 TCA|last=Petski|first=Denise|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref> but was postponed indefinitely amidst the [[2019-20 coronavirus outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/archer-season-11-premiere-date-coronavirus-fxx-1234572170|title=''Archer'' season 11 delayed due to Coronavirus|website=Variety|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Characters and settings==\n{{main|List of Archer characters}}\n\n''Archer'' follows the exploits of eight dysfunctional [[espionage|secret agents]] and supporting staff of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional [[New York City|New York]]-based intelligence agency.

Debuting on September 17, 2009, it follows the exploits of a dysfunctional intelligence agency, led by [[Sterling Archer]] (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) and seven of his colleagues\u2014Malory Archer ([[Jessica Walter]]), [[Lana Kane]] ([[Aisha Tyler]]), Cyril Figgis ([[Chris Parnell]]), [[Cheryl Tunt]] ([[Judy Greer]]), Pam Poovey ([[Amber Nash]]), Ray Gillette ([[Adam Reed]]) and Dr. Algernop Krieger ([[Lucky Yates]]). ''Archer''{{'s}} premise evolves as the comedy assumes the standard setup of an [[anthology series|anthology]] in later seasons, each with self-contained [[Narrative arc|arcs]], new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor. Beginning with the eighth season in 2017, the show was broadcast on sibling network [[FXX]].\n\n''Archer'' was conceived by Reed shortly after the cancellation of his [[Adult Swim]] comedy ''[[Frisky Dingo]]''. It draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]]. The show's hallmarks include reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and [[meta reference|meta-comedy]]. ''Archer'' is produced using [[limited animation]] and takes its visual style from mid-century comic art. The cast members record their lines individually, and the show regularly employs guest actors and actresses for supporting characters. There have been [[List of Archer episodes|110 episodes]] broadcast in ''Archer''{{'s}} history.\n\n''Archer'' has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and four [[Critics Choice Award]]s. It has also received 15 [[Annie Award]] nominations, among others, for outstanding achievement in animation, writing, direction, and voice acting. ''Archer'' will return to its original setup for the eight-episode eleventh season, as Reed oversees the comedy's production in a reduced role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/19/archer-season-11-interview/|title=FX's Archer renewed for surprise season 11, reveals major changes|last=Hibberd|first=James|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 20, 2019}}</ref> Season eleven was scheduled to premiere on May 6, 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/fx-sets-premiere-dates-for-fargo-mrs-america-better-things-devs-archer-more-tca-1202825595/|title=FX Sets Premiere Dates For \u2018Fargo\u2019, \u2018Mrs. America\u2019, \u2018Better Things\u2019, \u2018Devs\u2019, \u2018Archer\u2019 & More \u2013 TCA|last=Petski|first=Denise|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref> but was postponed indefinitely amidst the [[2019-20 coronavirus outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/archer-season-11-premiere-date-coronavirus-fxx-1234572170|title=''Archer'' season 11 delayed due to Coronavirus|website=Variety|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Characters and settings==\n{{main|List of Archer characters}}\n\n''Archer'' follows the exploits of eight dysfunctional [[espionage|secret agents]] and supporting staff of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional [[New York City|New York]]-based intelligence agency.

The committee secretary is first-in-charge of the province; second-in-command is the governor of the provincial government.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) claims the island of Taiwan and its surrounding islets, including Penghu, as \"[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]]\", though Taiwan has not been under control of a government that ruled from mainland China since 1949, when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] lost the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]], which established the PRC. ([[Kinmen]] and the [[Matsu Islands]] are claimed by the PRC as part of its Fujian Province. [[Pratas Islands|Pratas]] and [[Taiping Island|Taiping]] are claimed by the PRC as part of Guangdong and Hainan provinces respectively.) The territory is controlled by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, commonly called \"Taiwan\").\n\n=== Municipality===\n{{Main|Direct-administered municipalities of China}}\n\nA municipality ({{zh |s = \u76f4\u8f96\u5e02 |t = \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02 |p = zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec |l = direct-administrated city |links = no }}) or municipality directly under the administration of the central government is a higher level of city which is directly under the Chinese government, with status equal to that of the provinces. In practice, their political status is higher than that of common provinces.\n\n=== Autonomous region ===\n{{Main|Autonomous regions of China}}\n\nAn autonomous region ({{zh |s = \u81ea\u6cbb\u533a |t = \u81ea\u6cbb\u5340 |p = z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b |links = no }}) is a minority subject which has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group along with its own local government, but an autonomous region theoretically has more legislative rights than in actual practice.

As a result, there were 22 provinces in China (Outer China and [[China proper]]) near the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]].\n\n===ROC provinces (1912\u20131949)===\nThe [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], established in 1912, set up four more provinces in [[Inner Mongolia]] and two provinces in historic [[Tibet]], bringing the total to 28. In 1931, [[Ma Zhongying]] established [[Hexi Province|Hexi]] in the northern parts of Gansu but the ROC never acknowledged the province. However, China lost four provinces with the establishment of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]] in 1945, China re-incorporated Manchuria as 10 provinces, and assumed control of Taiwan as a province. As a result, the Republic of China in 1946 had 35 provinces. Although the Republic of China now only controls one province ([[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]), and some islands of a second province ([[Fujian]]), it continues to formally claim all 35 provinces (including those that no longer form part of the area of the People's Republic of China).\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Andong Province|Andong]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5b89\u6771\u7701}})

There are 34 such divisions claimed by the [[China|People's Republic of China]], classified as 23 '''provinces''' ({{zh|c=\u7701|hp=sh\u011bng}}), four [[direct-administered municipalities of China|municipalities]], five [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], and two [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]].

The committee secretary is first-in-charge of the province; second-in-command is the governor of the provincial government.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) claims the island of Taiwan and its surrounding islets, including Penghu, as \"[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]]\", though Taiwan has not been under control of a government that ruled from mainland China since 1949, when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] lost the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]], which established the PRC. ([[Kinmen]] and the [[Matsu Islands]] are claimed by the PRC as part of its Fujian Province. [[Pratas Islands|Pratas]] and [[Taiping Island|Taiping]] are claimed by the PRC as part of Guangdong and Hainan provinces respectively.) The territory is controlled by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, commonly called \"Taiwan\").\n\n=== Municipality===\n{{Main|Direct-administered municipalities of China}}\n\nA municipality ({{zh |s = \u76f4\u8f96\u5e02 |t = \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02 |p = zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec |l = direct-administrated city |links = no }}) or municipality directly under the administration of the central government is a higher level of city which is directly under the Chinese government, with status equal to that of the provinces. In practice, their political status is higher than that of common provinces.\n\n=== Autonomous region ===\n{{Main|Autonomous regions of China}}\n\nAn autonomous region ({{zh |s = \u81ea\u6cbb\u533a |t = \u81ea\u6cbb\u5340 |p = z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b |links = no }}) is a minority subject which has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group along with its own local government, but an autonomous region theoretically has more legislative rights than in actual practice. The governor of each autonomous region is usually appointed from the respective minority ethnic group.\n\n=== Special administrative region (SAR) ===\n{{Main|Special administrative regions of China}}\n\nA special administrative region (SAR) ({{zh |s = \u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a |t = \u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 |p = t\u00e8bi\u00e9 x\u00edngzh\u00e8ngq\u016b |links = no }}) is a highly autonomous and self-governing sub national subject of the People's Republic of China that is directly under the Central People's Government. Each SAR has a chief executive as head of the region and head of government. The region's government is not fully independent, as foreign policy and military defence are the responsibility of the central government, according to the basic laws.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== List of province-level divisions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!colspan=9|{{PRC provinces big imagemap alt}}\n|-\n!align=\"center\"|[[Guobiao|GB/T 2260-2007]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc# |title=GB/T 2260 codes for the provinces of China |access-date=2011-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040305025950/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc# |archive-date=2004-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n!align=\"center\"|[[ISO 3166-2:CN|ISO]]<ref>[[ISO 3166-2:CN]] ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 3166-2|3166-2]] codes for the provinces of China)</ref>\n!align=\"left\"|Province\n!align=\"left\"|Chinese<br />Hanyu Pinyin\n!align=\"left\"|Capital\n!align=\"right\"|Population{{efn|as of 2010}}\n!align=\"right\"|Density{{efn|per km<sup>2</sup>}}\n!align=\"right\"|Area{{efn|km<sup>2</sup>}}\n!align=\"center\" class=\"alphabetical\"| Abbreviation{{efn|Abbreviation in the parentheses is informal}}\n|-\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Anhui|Anhui Province]]                   |{{zh|labels=no|s=\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701}}|\u0100nhu\u012b Sh\u011bng   |{{lang|zh|\u7696}}  |CN-AH|9696ff| |[[Hefei]]       | 59,500,510| 425.91|139,700|AH|W\u01cen}}\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Beijing|Beijing Municipality]]|{{zh|labels=no|s=\u5317\u4eac\u5e02}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u5317\u4eac\u5e02}}|B\u011bij\u012bng Sh\u00ec|{{lang|zh|\u4eac}}|CN-BJ|ff8585||''Beijing''|19,612,368|1,167.40|16,800|BJ|J\u012bng}}\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Chongqing|Chongqing Municipality]]           |\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02|\u91cd\u6176\u5e02|Ch\u00f3ngq\u00ecng Sh\u00ec|{{lang|zh|\u6e1d}}    |CN-CQ|ff8585| |''Chongqing''| 28,846,170| 350.50|82,300|CQ|Y\u00fa}}\n|- style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"{{tent division chn 1|[[Fujian|Fujian Province]]{{efn|Most of the Fujian Province is administered by the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] while the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]] retains control of the [[Kinmen County]] (Quemoy) and [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang County]] (Matsu) under its own streamlined [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]].}}|{{zh|labels=no|s=\u798f\u5efa\u7701}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5efa\u7701}}|F\u00faji\u00e0n Sh\u011bng  |{{lang|zh|\u95fd}}  |CN-FJ|9696ff| |[[Fuzhou]] (PRC)<br>[[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng]] (ROC){{efn|The [[Fujian Provincial Government]] was formed on 1 May 1927 and the provincial government was relocated from [[Fuzhou|Foochow]] to Kinmen, then [[Xindian District|Hsintien Township]] and [[New Taipei City|Taipei County]] within [[Taiwan Province]] in 1956 before moving back to Kinmen on 15 January 1996.

Anhui were originally one province called Jiangnan, with its capital at Nanjing.

In 1931, [[Ma Zhongying]] established [[Hexi Province|Hexi]] in the northern parts of Gansu but the ROC never acknowledged the province. However, China lost four provinces with the establishment of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]] in 1945, China re-incorporated Manchuria as 10 provinces, and assumed control of Taiwan as a province. As a result, the Republic of China in 1946 had 35 provinces. Although the Republic of China now only controls one province ([[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]), and some islands of a second province ([[Fujian]]), it continues to formally claim all 35 provinces (including those that no longer form part of the area of the People's Republic of China).\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Andong Province|Andong]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5b89\u6771\u7701}})

He is best friends with [[#Marty|Marty]] the [[Plains zebra|zebra]] ([[Chris Rock]]). He is used to the life of comfort in the zoo but learns to adapt to the wild. He's smart, quick thinking and fast on his feet. He is a dancer by nature, often impressing others with his aerobatic feats. He does tend to be a little self-absorbed, often not seeing the problems of others above his own.\n\nAlex enjoys his life at the zoo and has plenty of friends and is surprised when hearing Marty's wish to leave and live in the wild (or run free in [[Connecticut]] as stated in the movie).<ref>\"Madagascar\"</ref> As a cub, Alex was born on an African wildlife reserve and named Alakay. He has brown and yellow fur, whiskers, a black nose, a big mane, and a long tufted tail. He was the son of the alpha lion, [[#Zuba|Zuba]] ([[Bernie Mac]]), and was constantly given lessons on hunting, though he displayed no interest in the activity. During one of the sessions, Alex was captured by [[Poaching|poachers]], but the crate he was contained in fell into a river and eventually floated to New York. He is found by humans who renamed him Alex and took to the Central Park Zoo. In ''Madagascar'', after Marty, Alex's best friend, leaves in an effort to take a train to the wild, Alex, [[#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]] ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]), and [[#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) pursue him and are shot with tranquilizer darts by humans. The animal-rights activists pressure the zoo into releasing them back into the wild, but on the ship to the preserve, Alex and his friends fall into the ocean. They wash ashore on [[Madagascar]], and, while Marty is excited to be free, Alex wishes to go home. He grows very hungry after days of being unable to eat, not realizing that steak is animal flesh. Hunger drives Alex into a crazed state, and after almost killing Marty in hunger (by biting him on the butt when he thought it was a piece of steak), in a moment of lucidity, he goes into self-imposed exile, barricading himself in the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] territory of the island. Marty pursues him, unwilling to leave his friend, but is attacked by the fossa, the native predators of Madagascar. Alex works to defend Marty and is later given [[sushi]] by the penguins to satiate his hunger.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Alex encounters his parents, Zuba and [[#Florrie|Florrie]] ([[Sherri Shepherd]]), who are overjoyed to see their son and he becomes co-alpha lion alongside his father.\n\nZuba assumes Alex is strong after hearing he is the \"King\" of New York and arranges a rite of passage into the pride. [[#Makunga|Makunga]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]), Zuba's rival, persuades Alex to challenge [[#Teetsi|Teetsi]] during the Alex's [[rite of passage]]. Teetsi was revealed to be a bulky, strong lion and Alex is quickly defeated by him. To keep from banishing Alex, Zuba transfers his control to Makunga, and in turn, he, Florrie, and Alex are banished. Zuba soon grows unaccepting of Alex after realizing he is not a fierce warrior. The next day, the watering hole is shown to be dried up and Alex leaves with Marty to find out the cause. They leave the safety of the reserve, prompting Zuba to follow Alex and bring him back. Alex discovers that the stranded New Yorkers had created a dam, and through the use of dancing, he is recognized by the attacking New Yorkers. With the help of others, the dam is destroyed and they return to the preserve. His father learns to respect his habits, and they remain in Africa instead of flying home with the penguins. In ''The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper'', a stuffed animal Alex is seen briefly and its head is quickly dismembered by Nana's toy poodle, Mr. Chew. Alex has small cameos with his friends celebrating Christmas and singing a version of \"[[Jingle Bells]]\".\n\nThe fact that Alex loses the challenge to Teetsi and is spanked by Nana in ''Madagascar'' gives him the impression he is a horrible fighter, but this is not true, because (in the Nana case), she only gets Alex by surprise, but was more visible when in ''Madagascar 2'', he has a short, but equilibrated{{clarify|date=November 2014}} fight against Nana. Alex is shown to have a superhuman level of interior physical strength, seeing that he broke the zoo's public telephone, and lifts Melman, Marty and Gloria with relative ease.\n\nAlex made another appearance in \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole.\" Wally Wingert reprises his role from the first video game. In the show, he appeared as a hallucination \"spirit guide\" to help Skipper, whose memories had been stolen by the evil Dr. Blowhole. At first, Skipper thought he was very talkative and annoying, but soon he accepted his guidance, especially when he had to face Blowhole when he got back to New York City. A running gag in the episode is that Skipper's friends are confused and convinced he's crazy when they see him talk to Alex, since only Skipper can see him. After Dr. Blowhole was defeated, Alex's spirit guide form disappeared.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', it opens on Alex's birthday and after a present from his friends of a mud New York he is determined to get the penguins from [[Monte Carlo]]. Alex creates four phases and after a fight with his friends they are exposed and are pursued by Captain Chantel DuBois.\n\nAfter cutting the DuBois' snare they fly back to New York until they crash in a train yard. Alex is determined to get back home and tries to fix the plane but fails. Then he persuades [[#Gia|Gia]] ([[Jessica Chastain]]) a [[North American jaguar|jaguar]] to let them on the train, with whom he is smitten upon first sight. After being let on the train Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria realized that this was a ticket home.\n\nAfter a failing performance in Rome, he gives a pep talk and has the circus spiced up to get the circus promoter for a tour in America. Stefano told Alex why [[#Vitaly|Vitaly]] ([[Bryan Cranston]]) the [[Siberian tiger]] was grouchy. Alex teaches Gia trapeze, and they begin to fall deeply in love. The London performance was better and they go to America. DuBois came to \"take home\" Alex but gets shot out of a cannon. Alex tells them why they had to join the circus.\n\nAlex gives another pep talk to his friends and Julien that they were wrong and they decide to go back until DuBois comes. Awakening, Alex realizes they are back in the zoo with iron cage links between them. Luckily the circus came and rescued him. But DuBois is still determined to get Alex's head and is taking Stefano. But Alex saves the day (with Gia's help) by saving [[#Stefano|Stefano]] ([[Martin Short]]), a [[sea lion]], and defeating DuBois.\n\n===Marty===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Marty\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Chris Rock]] (films and TV specials)<br />[[Phil LaMarr]] (video games)<br />Thomas Stanley (foal)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Plains zebra]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n|| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMarty is a male [[plains zebra]] who used to live at the Central Park Zoo, and is a good friend of [[#Alex|Alex]] the [[lion]]. He once had an [[iPod]] before Alex accidentally broke it. Marty likes seaweed on a stick.\n\nMarty is a hopeless [[optimism|optimist]]; he usually sees the brighter side of many things, taking every situation in stride. He has black and white stripes, a furry coat, a mane, and a tufted tail. He strives to be unique, which proves difficult when he meets his own kind in Africa, who look and act almost exactly the same. Marty is best friends with Alex and the two are rarely at odds. His carefree lifestyle tends to get on the nerves of his friends, but mostly serves to impress them; he is the one who helps hold the group together when things seem to get down.\n\nMarty lived a life of comfort in the zoo. After his tenth birthday had come and gone, meaning that his life was already half over, Marty decided that never having seen the wild, he must travel to the wild, for at least a short time.\n\nIn the movie, Alex says he's black with white stripes, as he has 30 black, and only 29 white, but this was partly because Alex had to give an explanation as to why he was licking Marty, as he thought he was the steak in his dream.\n\nThe film begins on Marty\u2019s 10th birthday (middle-aged for a zebra). His friends try to give him a great birthday, but somehow, Marty wants more. He escapes the [[Central Park Zoo]], where he had lived for the past ten years, and makes a dash for the wild. His friends, Alex, [[#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]], and [[#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]], flag him down, but as they are about to take him back to the zoo, police officers and animal control officers appear in all directions, tranquilize the animals, and send them on a ship to a wildlife preserve in [[Kenya]]. The [[#Penguins|penguins]] take over the ship and the four friends are washed up on the shores of [[Madagascar]].\n\nOnce on the island, Marty had his dream fulfilled. Marty sets up a \"bar\" on the island, known as \"Casa del Wild\" (in English ''Home of the Wild''). Alex is mad at Marty for getting them shipped to the wild, but he later apologizes to Marty and actually begins to enjoy himself on the island. Unfortunately, his enjoyment brings on his killer instincts, causing him to attack the resident lemurs and his friends, including Marty. Alex does not \"go savage\" for long, and after regaining his senses, he runs away from his friends out of regret. Soon after that, Marty learns the hard way that the wild is not what it seems to be, and how hard it really is for many animals to live there with so many predators and other dangers. Realizing the consequences brought upon by his impulsive actions, such as sacrificing his and the other's lives at the Zoo (the one safe place they called home) and the misfortune he caused his best friend, Marty comes to truly regret his birthday wish. However, after learning of the penguins having hijacked a boat and are offering the zoo animals a trip back home, Marty immediately runs after Alex in hopes to save his friend. Alex is later able to rejoin his friends as they head back to the zoo.\n\nMarty, along with his friends, has only a few small cameos in ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]''. He, Alex, and Gloria are seen at the beginning decorating Melman's neck with Christmas lights. At the end, he, his friends, and almost all the other zoo animals are seen singing their own version of \"Jingle Bells\".\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Marty (along with Alex, Melman, Gloria, Hannah, the lemurs, and the penguins) finds himself stranded in Africa after a failed attempt at flying to New York. There, he joins a herd of zebra that all look and sound exactly like him. While he enjoys this new lifestyle at first, he quickly becomes depressed when it becomes evident he has no individuality in a herd. Marty also becomes upset when Alex is unable to tell him apart from the other zebras. Ultimately, Alex is able to make amends by picking Marty out of the herd (later revealed to be due to the bite mark left on his backside from the previous film, and the fact that he is black with white stripes, while the other zebras are all white with black stripes.) Marty accompanies his friend to unblock a dam set by stranded New Yorkers in the jungle (which causes the watering hole to dry up). When Alex is caught, Marty gets the other animals to help rescue him.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', Marty joins the circus along with the others. His circus act is cannon along with [[#Stefano|Stefano]] the [[New Zealand sea lion|sea lion]]. In the middle of the film, you can tell he loves the afro. At the end of the film, it is shown that Marty is dancing in his afro (along with the others) to the tune Afro Circus / I like to Move it.\n\n===Melman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Melman Mankiewicz III\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[David Schwimmer]] (films and TV specials)<br />[[Stephen Stanton]] (video games)<br />[[Zachary Gordon]] (calf)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Reticulated giraffe]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMelman Mankiewicz III is a male [[reticulated giraffe]]. He has a furry coat, green eyes, whiskers, a snout, a long neck, brown spots, horns, and a tufted tail. He is somewhat of a [[hypochondriac]], having doses of medicine for meals and doctor's appointments frequently. He even complains about having brown spots on his neck (the spots, in real life, are natural).\n\nHe is skittish most of the time, but often has moments of profound clarity. His experience being medicated has given him insight regarding how to treat sick or injured animals who might otherwise give up hope and dig a hole, waiting to die in it. His love for Gloria is deep, and is always a gentleman to her; to Marty and Alex, he's just another one of the \"awkward\" guys.\n\nMelman had a residence at the Central Park Zoo, where he received constant medical treatment for problems that were all psychosomatic. He would undergo MRIs, CAT scans, injections, flu shots, and be put into braces and crutches for no particular purpose at all. In the Central Park Zoo, Melman was used to his cushy life taking pills and undergoing treatments. One night, Marty the Zebra escaped and Melman immediately informed Alex of this.\n\nIn a flashback in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', there is a hint that he had a crush on Gloria as a child (as he seems uncomfortable when she comments that Alex is cute). When the animals nearly die trying to fly back to New York in a salvaged airplane, he screams he is in love with Gloria; she is asleep and does not hear. In Africa, Melman is horrified to learn that once a giraffe becomes sick, it has no way to survive and therefore must simply wait in a hole to die. He takes the position of Witch Doctor to cure sick animals, introducing them to Western medicine and giving them longer and better lives.\n\nWhile he proves to be a very good witch doctor, he is informed by another giraffe that Melman has a brown spot on his shoulder, one which the previous Witch Doctor seemed to have gotten and \"was gone\" two days later. Thinking he only has two days to live, Melman initially waits in a hole, but then takes King Julien's advice and goes to declare his love to Gloria. He finds her on a date and simply tells her date what a wonderful girl Gloria is and to treat her right. When the watering hole dries up and King Julien decides to sacrifice an animal for the water gods, Melman offers himself. He is saved at the last moment, when Gloria tells him that she loves him back, and the two become a couple; it becomes apparent the \"brown spot\" was not fatal (the previous Witch Doctor is found alive and well, the brown spot in fact being a natural giraffe spot); however, there is not a scene where Melman is told of this. It is assumed that he figured it out when his \"time\" came and went and he was fine. He was last seen dancing off into the sunset with Gloria, Alex and Marty.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', Melman and Gloria are still together. They and the other animals go to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. Once inside the hotel, Melman, Alex and Marty argue over who should be the leader of the group. They are crushed by Gloria's weight and they fall into the casino. Whilst escaping the hotel with the other animals, they are pursued by DuBois. On the way they lose DuBois and manage to reach the Hotel Ambassador. While boarding the plane, Melman is grabbed by the neck when DuBois appears. Alex with a little help from Mort, cuts the rope and saves Melman.\n\nAbove the skies of France, the plane's engine fails and it crash lands into a suburban rail yard. Whilst running from the authorities who are closing in on them, Melman gives Alex the idea of boarding the train containing the circus. Upon arrival in Rome, Melman and the group realize how terrible the circus was. En route to London, Melman and the others are discussing how terrible the circus was before Alex tells them about his newfound inspiration.\n\nMelman and Gloria create a dancing tightrope act that is performed in London. When Melman and his friends are pursued by DuBois, the circus discover their true identities.\n\n=== Gloria ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Gloria\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] (films and TV specials)<br />[[Bettina Bush]] (video games)<br />[[Willow Smith]] (calf)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Common hippopotamus]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nGloria is a female [[hippopotamus]] who resided in the [[Central Park Zoo]] as an attraction, all the while being good friends with Alex, Marty, Melman, and becoming the latter's girlfriend as of ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa''. She has gray skin, brown eyes, a snout, short arms and legs, black fingernails, an enormously fat belly, short stubby tail, and a triangular belly button. Gloria comically serves as the height of the gang, both intentionally and in situations she accidentally falls into. She is often serious with what she is talking about and the guys are careful not to get on her nerves.\n\nAs a hippopotamus, Gloria is another animal in the Central Park Zoo and was one of the many attractions, drawing crowds that enjoyed seeing her swim about in her water tank. She would also receive the star treatment as one of the zoo's main attractions and attend Marty\u2019s birthday party. At this party, Marty announced his wish upon blowing out the candles on his cake: to go to the wild. Gloria, Alex and Melman tried to have Marty come to his senses by telling him life out in the wilds was savage and difficult, whereas life in the zoos was adequate. Marty was unhappy at hearing this, and Gloria told Alex to go to console Marty. Later that night, Marty acted out his wish and headed straight for the Terminal Station to take a train and go to Connecticut, where Marty heard wide open spaces were found. Gloria urged both Alex and Melman to come with her to find Marty and bring him back before any people would notice. They were found, regardless, along with Mason and Phil, the two chimps, and a troupe of secretive penguins, all ending up tranquilized with darts.\n\nWhen they all came to, they found themselves in crates bound for Africa. When the penguins hijack the ship, the crates fall into the ocean and wash up on the island of Madagascar. After some confusion, they start to set up their own society and attract the attention of a lemur colony.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Gloria expresses a desire to join in the zoo breeding program, in the hopes of finding a boyfriend. When the animals crash land in Africa, she attracts the attention of a hippo named Moto Moto. Though she thinks he is the ideal boyfriend at first, she realizes that he only loves her for her size, whereas Melman loves her for who she is. Realizing that she loves Melman back, she stops him from sacrificing himself into the volcano, even saying \"It's crazy to think that I had to go halfway around the world to find the perfect guy was right next door...\" and then joins the other animals in rescuing Alex from Nana.\n\nGloria returns in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' with Melman, the couple finds their way as they contribute to the circus' success with a spectacular tightrope act.\n\n===The Penguins===\nA group of the NYC [[ad\u00e9lie penguin]] spies. Skipper is a major character in the first film, but Kowalski, Rico, and Private are supporting characters and don't talk much until ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]''. All four penguins have major roles in the first sequel and supporting roles in the second sequel.\n\n====Skipper====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Skipper\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nSkipper is the leader of the [[ad\u00e9lie penguin]]s (despite their color-schemes not matching the real species) and is the main character in the TV show. He has dark, [[sapphire (color)|sapphire]]-blue eyes and his head is flatter than those of the other three penguins. Like the rest of the penguins, he has no idea what is expected of the penguin species, other than to \"smile and wave.\" At one point, Private used a bird biology book to tell the other penguins how to act, but since the penguins usually need the chimpanzees Phil and Mason to translate for them, it was unclear how either he or Private were able to read the biology book, which is presumably written in English. His sidekicks, Kowalski, Rico, and Private don't talk much until ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]''.\n\nIn the first ''Madagascar'' movie, Skipper is the mastermind behind a plot to escape the confines of the zoo and leave for Antarctica. Kowalski, Rico, and Private are his accomplices in this plot. They dig under their enclosure until they reach Marty the zebra, thinking it to be the South Pole. Skipper explains to Marty that they are attempting to escape the zoo because penguins do not belong there in captivity. He then orders his accomplices to continue tunneling. Late that night, Skipper and the other penguins are caught by a SWAT team, as are six other animals found outside the zoo. The penguins are tranquilized and put into a crate to be transferred.\n\nWhen they awake, Skipper is confused at the lettering on the crate where they are being held and orders Mason to read it; Mason's companion Phil reads it. According to the box, they are all bound for a wildlife preserve in Africa, despite the cold climate penguins need. Skipper orders Rico to pick the lock on the crate where they are held, whereupon the four penguins knock out the crew and take command of the ship, commandeering it to reach Antarctica. Skipper and his mates finally reach Antarctica and are sorely disappointed by the barren, desolate terrain (as evidenced by Private's exclamation, \"Well, this sucks...\") Skipper has the ship return quickly from the South Pole, where it crashes into the beaches of Madagascar and a much warmer climate. Upon arriving, he and the other three encounter Gloria and Melman, and see that Alex and Marty (whom they refer to as their \"monochromatic friend\") are gone. Skipper decides to help rescue Marty from the grim fate of being eaten by the native foossa (possibly as gratitude for Marty\u2019s silence regarding the escape). It is Skipper who helps to distract the foossa while Marty is recovered, and also helps fight off a number of them.\n\nSkipper notices later on that Alex is still hungry, not having been able to eat steak, and has Rico prepare sushi for Alex. Skipper then relinquishes control of the ship to Alex, as he no longer needs it, and proceeds to sunbathe on the tropical beaches in comfort. Skipper is asked by Private if they should tell Alex and his friends that the ship is out of gas. Skipper declines, telling his troupe to \"Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave.\"\n\nIn ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', Skipper and the penguins salvage a crashed airplane to fly back to New York. They fix the plane when it crashes in Africa with the help of \"more thumbs\" (Mason and Phil). At the end of the movie, he marries a [[bobblehead]] doll. In ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', the bobblehead is nowhere to be seen.\n\nIn ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'', it is revealed that Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private, along with Mason and Phil, have been in Monte Carlo. With Phil dressed as the \"King of Versailles,\" they are able to amass a fortune of jewels, diamonds and gold and plan to buy an aircraft to pick up the \"hippies\" (Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman) in Africa and return to New York. Things change when Alex and the others rush to Monte Casino, believing that the penguins have abandoned them. Skipper later uses the fortune to help the gang become part of a traveling circus. After saving the gang skipper turns to a life of crime and soon creates a mafia known as the Frozen Tuxedos. skipper and his original crew control Europe with an iron fist. soon after this skipper launches an attack on the US plunging the world into World War Three.\n\n\nSkipper is one of the four main characters of ''The Penguins of Madagascar''. In the show, many things are revealed about him and it expands on his character from the movies. In multiple episodes it is shown that Skipper knows karate and is an exceptionally capable fighter. He's also very strong, as seen in \"Launchtime.\" In \"Crown Fools,\" he states that he had taken down an angry walrus with \"a wing and a prayer and another wing\". However, in \"Needle Point\", it is revealed that he has [[Trypanophobia|a fear of needles]], so in later episodes if he's injured he's treated with medical cream or the like. Generally, he is a straight man, displaying a very stereotypical general personality when not in battle: he's been shown waking his men up early in the morning for training, has given them trials on being able to work without him a number of times, and has been shown to being very hard-boiled. He is, though, soft on his men at times, properly rewarding them and even showing fear and worry when he knows they're in danger. He becomes especially upset when he believes one of them to be dead. He often tries to hide this part, as he once told Private that he (Private) is always bait because he \"is gullible and expendable,\" but later becomes upset when Private is eaten.\n\nAlthough Skipper's plans and theories often serve as jokes, his most unorthodox theories are sometimes proven true; the Blowhole existence is the most extreme example of this. Doctor Blowhole is first mentioned in \"Eclipsed\", when Skipper brings up his plan to extinguish the sun; this is because the sun was covered by a solar eclipse and, before Mason, Phil, and Kowalski mentioned it, Skipper believed he finally succeeded. Skipper being paranoid often comes up due to his theories, and whether or not he's right depends on the episode. Often, those around him refuse to follow along, mostly Marlene because she believes Skipper overreacts. He often comes up with theories without basis on new arrivals, usually flying [[piranha]] or being a spy for Doctor Blowhole. According to him, there are actually 8 continents, since he counts [[Atlantis]] (and appears to believe it is off the coast of Brazil). He once tells Maurice that if he had Skipper's security clearance, he would believe it too. Skipper indicates that he believes that some new arrivals to the zoo could be flying [[piranha]]. In the episode \"Launchtime,\" when he asks Kowalski to search for a place where nearly no lemurs can be found, he states that he cannot set foot in Denmark; when Private questions him on this, he replies by saying \"Well, that's private, Private, between me and the Danes.\" It is later revealed that the incident in question was caused by Hans the Puffin, revolving around a fish fight and top secret documents that made them both public enemy number one.\n\nSkipper has mentioned that there used to be two more penguins (Manfredi and Johnson, named for two ill-fated characters in the [[World War II]] prisoner-of-war saga [[Stalag 17#Plot synopsis|Stalag 17]]) in addition to himself and the other three; this is unconfirmed, and these claims have never been adequately explained. When they're brought up, it's usually as a warning or an aside remark, as they died in the past during a mission. In \"The Hidden\", he mentions that they died during a mission when they were attacked by \"flying piranhas\" and that they had to \"bury what was left of them with a tea spoon\". In \"A Kipper for Skipper,\" when Skipper states that \"relatively few penguins get left behind\", as the others point out that Manfredi, Johnson, and another penguin were. In \"Roger Dodger,\" he tells Rico that he would take him out if he had to and tells him \"just ask Manfredi and Johnson.\" In \"An Elephant Never Forgets,\" he tells them that while he was training Private that Manfredi and Johnson \"fell for the exploding elephant foot.\" They are also mentioned by Private, who claims that they mistook the hind end of a [[beluga whale]] for an escape tunnel. In \"Maurice at Peace,\" it is implied that they were accidentally smothered by the others due to a misinterpretation of a message which actually said to smother them with affection. In \"Smotherly Love,\" it is mentioned that they died a very relaxing death in a day spa.\n\nIn ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', he uses some Italian words such as \"Sempre all'erta\" (in \"Haunted Habitat\"), \"Bravissimo\" (in \"The Hidden\"), \"Attenzione\" (in \"Crown Fools\"), \"Eccellente\" (in \"Kingdom Come\"), \"Finito!\" (in \"Popcorn Panic\") and \"Perfetto\" (in \"An Elephant Never Forgets\"). His Italian pronunciation is not perfect. In \"The Falcon and the Snow Job,\" Skipper falls for a female [[Peregrine falcon]] named Kitka and they date for a while. Skipper breaks up with her after it is revealed that she had swallowed Fred the squirrel, and in subsequent episodes she wasn't heard from or mentioned.\n\nSkipper shares a very strong friendship with Marlene, a female Asian Otter who lives across from the penguins and is a main character in the series. Despite their conflicting differences and clashes of personality, the two still remain very close and are able to keep their bond of friendship strong. Marlene is also considered \"privileged\" by Skipper, due to the fact that he thinks of her as a smart, which is rather unusual, considering his otherwise generally scornful opinion of mammals. He sometimes allows her to tag along on missions.\n\nAs the series ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' continues, Skipper starts to realize that Private is following in his footsteps in \"Private and the Winky-Factory.\" Skipper also becomes less sensitive to his enemies Dr. Blowhole and Hans the Puffin. Over the course of the series, he likes and trusts them less and less. In the Dr. Blowhole Special \"Blowhole Strikes Back,\" Hans and Skipper are referred to as \"frenemies.\" At the beginning of the episode, Hans surprises Skipper by meeting him in China and refers to him as such.\n\n====Kowalski====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Kowalski\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] (films and other media)<br />[[Jeff Bennett]] (''The Penguins of Madagascar'')\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nKowalski is [[second-in-command]] and the tallest of the penguins, forming plans for the group and usually taking notes for Skipper. When Skipper is absent, he takes charge and his rank is [[First Lieutenant]]. He has blue eyes and tends to over-analyze situations.\n\nOften formulating plans for the group, Kowalski is a loyal supporter of his leader, Skipper. Kowalski had escaped the zoo with the other penguins but was promptly captured and put into a crate for transfer with his comrades. The crates were all placed on a ship bound for Africa, where all the creatures from the zoo would be kept in a wildlife preserve. While in the crate, Kowalski confessed that he could not read (he said the words on the side of the box were an \"older code\", in slight reference to ''Return of the Jedi'') and asked another transferee, a chimpanzee named Phil, to read the words on the crate. As soon as this was done, the four penguins headed to the ship's bridge, knocked out the crew and captain, bound them up, and Kowalski plotted the ship's course to Antarctica.\n\nHe is the [[technician]] of the group and always has his notepad (and an [[abacus]] in the animated series). While being able to formulate plans and invent things (such as a rocket ship out of a trashcan and fireworks, a futuristic rotary saw blade made of energy and multiple random objects, or an intelligence sucking machine from just a [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] box, a magnet, and a vacuum) he is shown to have a bit of difficulty deducing simpler machines. At the end of \"Needle Point\", it is revealed that he has a fear of zoological oral checks. He seems to also spout nearly or completely nonsensical words, such as, \"The moo cow may have a chocolate marshmallow\", or \"I'll be a bicycle cream cone\", whenever either hit incredibly hard (as he did when body checked by a giant rat during a hockey game) or when shocked severely (as by Officer X's stun gun). He screamed \"[[Galileo Galilei]]\" when he got his injection during \"Needle Point\". He also loves candy.\n\nIn the series he is shown to be intelligent but it is not as apparent in the films, which reveal that he does not know how to read (English) (e.g. in ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', he states that the paper plane would help them fly back to New York and he does not understand that the fuel indicator was indicating that fuel is finished; and in ''Penguins of Madagascar'' he wrongly calculated that they arrived in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], when in reality they arrived in [[Shanghai]]). He does most of his calculations on an abacus, although he was briefly in possession of a calculator that was destroyed. He is in love with a dolphin called Doris and recorded a poem for her on DVD which highlighted her apparent non-interest in him in the \"Hot Ice\" episode. (She was first mentioned in \"Gone in a Flash\" with a photo being shown.)\n\nIt has been noted that his inventions have a habit of horribly backfiring regardless of his best intentions or their successes. Some of his most significant blunders include: a time machine (or 'Chronotron') that triggered a temporal rift that nearly destroyed reality and resulted in three of Kowalski appearing in one place (noticeably, the first Kowalski from the future wanted to stop the ray and the second one wanted it to keep working); a youth ray (designed to return spoiled food to its fresher state) that turned Skipper into a chick; a mind-switching machine (which backfired in its first use because he forgot to take the warm-blooded/cold-blooded conflict into account when switching Rico with Roger); a device called the \"Chronocurbulator\" that stops time that left time seemingly permanently frozen when it broke down; a helmet that granted the user the power of telekinesis; an invisibility ray (or 'Transparent Matter-Maker', called 'Transmatterer' for short due to copyright issues) that turned itself invisible before being set to randomly fire; a mind-reading machine that quickly burnt out due to lack of processing power; a cloning machine that relied on the Higgs Boson particle for power; nanites that could reprogram other machines (these were programmed to not harm a penguin, but this backfired when they locked the penguins in their habitat to 'protect' them); and the artificially engineered life-form 'Jiggles', who consumed the zoo's fruit and nearly destroyed the zoo when it grew to monstrous size. In ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'', an invention of his called a \"nucular\" reactor (sic) is used.\n\nAs a result of his inventions, he comes off as unhinged, especially when he becomes overly defensive about what he does. Outright called a mad scientist by Skipper, Kowalski often creates things in order to \"show them\" and has, on few occasions, hidden his devices. In \"I Know Why The Caged Bird Goes Insane\", he becomes increasingly derailed as the episode goes on after being temporarily bound to a wheelchair, mostly because the nursery he was being held in was right next door to the Science Expo, and he makes a few attempts to break out.\n\nKowalski can play a banjo and sing as seen in the episode \"Concrete Jungle Survival\".\n\n====Rico====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Rico\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] (''Madagascar'')<br />[[John DiMaggio]] (most media)<br />[[Fred Tatasciore]] (second video game)<br />[[Conrad Vernon]] (''Penguins of Madagascar'')\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nRico, third-in-command of the penguins, does not really talk too much. He is similar in physical features to the other penguins in the movies, but he has a tuft of feathers shaped like a Mohawk and a scar of unknown origin on his left cheek in the television series, which makes him easier to distinguish, particularly from Skipper. Rico is the greediest and fattest of the penguins - he will eat almost anything, and thinks constantly of food. Skipper describes him as \"clearly a world-class psychopath\". Rico appears to be not merely particularly psychotic, but to some degree mentally deficient. In \"Friend in a Box\" Kowalski points a mind-reading device at him which, despite seeming to function perfectly for the other three penguins, picks up only the word 'Fish' being thought by Rico. According to Skipper, it was a mystery how Rico passed the psych test. On the other hand, in \"Cat's Cradle\" Skipper tells Rico to demonstrate shutting off all unnecessary brain functions to conserve oxygen, and Rico seems to 'deactivate' by deflating his entire body.\n\nIn the first and second film, what little speech Rico used suggested that his native language is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and his [[sushi]]-preparation skills added to this idea. However, in the TV series, he communicated with excitable garbled grunts, but could still manage short sentences in English, and his language further improved by the second season. He has also displayed a fondness for a plastic doll toy called Miss Perky. He's the team's weapons expert and his main function is to [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitate]] any necessary tools that Skipper may need for a mission. His stomach operates as a [[hammer space]], containing items as large or larger than himself, or that weigh much more than common sense would allow, with no ill effect on himself. He can swallow and regurgitate almost anything from paperclips and explosives, all the way to a running chainsaw and ground-to-air missile. As the show went on, characters could actually reach inside him and pull things out. His stomach even contains a spiral staircase and elevator, and he can swallow other characters and regurgitate them safely, as he has swallowed both Mort and Kowalski.\n\nHe's very fond of explosives, and his answer to problems would always be \"Kaboom!\", if Skipper did not keep him in line.\n\nRico has little tolerance for \"mushy\" stuff, and often becomes nauseous when Private gets overly emotional and \"lovey-dovey\" about something. On the other hand he seems to be the second most emotional penguin next to Private and is deeply in love with a doll called Ms. Perky. Another characteristic of Rico is that he might be incredibly superstitious, as, after receiving a rather dismal sounding fortune in a fortune cookie, Rico was a victim of pranks by King Julien who was trying to prove it was right. Even after revealing that Julien was behind the accidents, Rico still needed to have him \"take away the curse.\" He is also insanely skilled with knives and bladed objects, able to make sashimi or carve a Christmas tree from ice in a matter of seconds and destroy bowling pin dummies with a chainsaw while blindfolded.\n\nRico's psychosis needs to be controlled at all times, by Skipper limiting his use of destructive solutions, often involving explosions. Giving him free rein to destroy to his heart's desire, Rico builds up enough psychotic pressure that he becomes a vortex of destruction, spinning out of control and destroying everything in his path. Kowalski once estimated Rico was capable of destroying the entire zoo in this state.\n\nRico appears to have an outstanding opera voice when excited (as seen in episodes \"Go Fish\", \"Herring Impaired\", \"High Moltage\", \"Hair Apparent\", etc.).\n\nIn the episode \"Herring Impaired\", Rico shows that he can be responsible when his friends need help, and because the other penguins had \"Pisces Dementia\", Rico had to keep watch over his friends to make sure they don't have another fish for 24 hours. During the episode, Maurice asked that \"Since when did we get four Ricos?\" showing that Rico is actually known for his appetite for fish and insanity among the other animals.\n\n====Private====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Private\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Christopher Knights]] (films and video games)<br />[[James Patrick Stuart]] (''The Penguins of Madagascar'')\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nPrivate is the youngest and shortest of the penguins. He has the largest sexual appetite of the penguins, he is a dirty dog and sexual fiend, always loves to get it on with the lady's ;). He has light blue eyes and speaks with a [[United Kingdom|British]] accent (though the other penguins think his accent is fake).<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Hard Boiled Eggy|episodelink=List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep54|series=The Penguins of Madagascar|serieslink=The Penguins of Madagascar|network=[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]|airdate=June 19, 2010|season=2|number=6|minutes=8:17|quote=Kowalski: He's putting on an adorably phony British accent. Skipper: Just like the private. Private: Phony? This is how I really talk.}}</ref> Private has been known to be a rather curious penguin and is much nicer and down-to-earth than the others. In a way, he's much more childish, enjoying \"Lunacorns\" (pony dolls based on a show that teaches good morals and friendship) and often suggesting much nicer plans (such as asking for something instead of breaking into a habitat or simply telling the truth to others.) He is often called inexperienced by the others. He has an addiction to Peanut Butter Winkies, first displayed in \"Skorka\" and further elaborated on in later episodes.\n\nHe was overprotective of the egg in the episode \"Paternal Egg-Stinct\", though given how his team mates were treating it (Skipper put it through a dangerous obstacle course, Kowalski tried shock treatments to increase its intelligence, and Rico was flying it with a hang glider), this was rational. Private is very good at deciphering the code, communications and peace treaties, and in some degrees, common sense.\n\nPrivate has been known to give life lessons (in \"Mort Unbound\" he tells Mort, \"There is a natural order of things\" and in \"Two Feet High and Rising\" he tells Mort that Julien's feet \"are just feet; not love\"). Private is emotionally sensitive, and is often portrayed as more observant or down to earth than the others (noticing when Skipper's ankle tag had not been taken off, indicating that he did not get a shot or suggesting that Maurice had stumbled back because of being blinded by a camera flash, which Skipper quickly labeled as preposterous though he nevertheless told Kowalski to run a scenario) as well as having fighting skills on a par with or only slightly below those of Rico and Skipper (in one episode he is able to block rapid strikes from Skipper and disarm him with his feet while spinning on his head, all while blindfolded). On the wall of the Penguin's HQ is a stuffed fish with a sign \"Private's First Prize\"; hiding behind it (as well as a bunch of electronic precautions) is his most prized possession: a [[butterscotch]] lollipop. Like Kowalski, he loves candy, but eating too much of it causes him to hallucinate. He has an abnormal fear of badgers and cockroaches, as shown in the \"Badger Pride\" and \"Stop Bugging Me\" episodes respectively. When Private is the last available penguin to fix a situation (such as when it's revealed that the penguins had spied on the rest of the zoo occupants or during 'Untouchable'), he is able to rise to the occasion and execute a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nIn the episode \"Cute-Astrophe\", Private ended up developing a \"hyper-cute\" ability, wherein he achieves a state of over 132% adorability, that will make everyone around him pass out as they cannot cope with how absolutely cute he is. At first, Skipper abused the hyper-cute, using it on everyone around them, so Private swore to never use it again after the misuse of the hyper-cute caused chaos around the zoo and nearly got them sent away. Despite his vow, the hyper-cute made appearances in other episodes. This ability was attempted in one episode when Private was molting, but instead of knocking an observer out with adorability, it frightened and panicked anybody seeing him use the ability.\n\nIn the \"Concrete Jungle Survival\" episode, Private received the rank of [[Private First Class]] after successfully passing a test in the city. He had been just a [[Private (rank)|Private]] beforehand.\n\nIn the Christmas special \"Merry Madagascar\" Private finds himself falling in love with Cupid, one of Santa's reindeer. The relationship is short-lived, as Cupid must return and work with Santa. Private reminded her that they would \"Always have Madagascar!\" as she flew off.\n\nPrivate is the only penguin with known relatives, he has an uncle named Nigel (though they may not be related), and in \"Operation Penguin,\" he mentions his father is named Sam Fishy, though Sam Fishy has yet to be shown onscreen. However, in ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'', he appeared to have been abandoned as an egg, leading to the possibility that he is an [[orphan]].\n\n===The Lemurs===\n\n====King Julien XIII====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = King Julien XIII\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] (films)<br />[[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] (TV series and specials, video games, and ''Madagascar 3'' soundtrack)<br />[[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]] (first video game)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ring-tailed lemur]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nKing Julien XIII is an Indian-accented conceited, selfish, fun-loving [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n\nAs a self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs, Julien ruled over a great colony of lemurs in Madagascar using mostly his charisma and [[Delegation|delegating]], i.e. telling other people what they should do since he certainly had very little ability to lead. Nevertheless, he shows more intelligence and calmness compared to the other lemurs (aside from Maurice), which is shown when the very word \"[[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]]\" drives all of them, except himself and Maurice, into a state of panic.\n\nHe had parties for his people on [[Madagascar]] with much frequency, the likes of which were interrupted constantly by the fossa, which trespassed onto the lemur territory, devouring all that they could catch.\n\nIn Julien's early life as seen in ''All Hail King Julien'', he was depicted as the nephew of King Julien XII, who banned all noisy things to keep the fossa from attacking. After Julien XII abdicated to evade a prophecy from being eaten by the Fossa, Julien XIII became the new King of the Lemurs and did things that were opposite his uncle's rules. He saves his people from the Fossa and got bitten on the butt by the Fossa and he survived. When he learns that his nephew is still alive and is still king, his devious uncle tries to get rid of him and reclaim the throne. When he returned, Uncle King Julien tricks Julien into going into the Fossa territory to find out what they're planning with Maurice joining him. In the end, Julien discovered his uncle's plot, glad that Clover chose him over his uncle, and gives his uncle a second chance, by putting him in the Fossa disguise, that is being cuddled by a Fossa girl, much to his uncle's dismay.\n\nThe day Alex and his friends came to Madagascar, King Julien and his subjects were enjoying one of their parties when it was invaded by the fossa. When the fossa were scared off by Alex, Julien and his people were hiding in the trees and saw this scene, thinking Alex and his friends were giants from some faraway land, with Julien coming forward and presenting himself as the king of the lemurs&nbsp;\u2014 once he had ascertained they were not dangerous by tempting them with Mort.\n\nWhen asked where the people were, Julien pointed to a skeleton of a man caught in a parachute hanging from a tree. Later that night, Julien had a meeting of the lemurs and other creatures of the jungle in the plane. Julien insisted that if they could make friends with Alex and his friends, the foossa would be scared away for good. Maurice was skeptical about this plan, but Julien insisted that, being king, his ideas were the best. Julien's plan failed when Alex started to get out of control and try to kill the lemurs and his friends. Although Alex then turned back to normal and the foossa were scared away with only the actions of the four main characters and the penguins, Julien took the credits for its success. However, when it went wrong, he did not foist the idea back onto Maurice.\n\nWhen Alex and his friends were ready to go back to New York, Julien gave them his crown; he had already made himself a bigger, better one using a leaf-tailed [[gecko]] named Stevie.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Julien, along with Maurice and Mort, accompany Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman to New York on the plane built by the penguins while leaving Stevie in charge until the day he returns. He is in the first class, ordering constant refreshments, and amusing himself with plane crash videos. As the plane crashes down to Africa after running out of fuel and momentum, Julien takes utter pleasure in the feeling of weightlessness caused by the high-speed descent. By being in first class, he escapes the crash with a parachute but loses his crown.\n\nUpon arriving in Africa, Julien at first believes they are in New York and makes himself a new crown. He manages to gain some power while in Africa, although very few characters actually pay attention to him, getting to ride a flock of [[flamingo]]s with Maurice, then moving on to riding [[ostriches]] and finally an elephant. Later, when the reserve's watering hole dries up, Julien suggests to the animals that they make a sacrifice to \"his good friends, the water gods\" at the volcano to replenish the water. To convince the masses, King Julien enacts his casual conversation with the Water Gods. Later, Julien persuades Melman to volunteer for the sacrifice, who believed he was going to die soon anyway. But when Melman realized he was going to live, he gave up on being a sacrifice, leaving Julien disappointed at his plan's failure. Mort arrives soon after, followed by a persistent shark that had been attempting to eat him. This shark then falls into the volcano, thus completing the sacrifice, and as Julien comes out of the volcano, he sees the water coming back to the reserve (due, in fact, to a dam constructed by Nana being destroyed by Alex and Zuba), and is convinced of his plan's success. From this King Julien concludes that the Water Gods like seafood more.\n\nJulien appears in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' regularly, often noisily and unintentionally annoying Skipper and pretty much everyone. He is the self-proclaimed \"King of the Zoo\" no doubt due to his former king status on Madagascar. Only Mort and Maurice truly believe and respect him as their king, the rest just show up to his \"proclamation of royal decrees.\" Julien is proven to be a worthy ally in most episodes, since it is he who sometimes saves the day for the penguins (like in \"[[The Penguins of Madagascar: Operation: DVD Premiere#Television special: \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\"|Dr. Blowhole's Revenge]]\"). Julien hates having anyone touch his feet, such as passing a royal decree that anyone who touches his feet would be banished from his kingdom (the zoo). When the sewer rats went to the zoo and tricked the Penguins out of their home, Julien decided to play for the Penguins in a game of Hockey to try and win their home back. They were losing until one of the rats touched his feet, after that he lost it and beat all of them on his own.\n\nIn the episode \"Crown Fools\", Julien panics when he loses his crown and obsessively longs for it until it is revealed that he had a spare crown all along (prompting Marlene, who was trying to make him new crowns all day, to chase him with a crowbar). Despite his desire for everyone to listen and do what he wants, he dislikes and ignores Mort, his most loyal follower, who treats him like a god. Mort responds to everything Julien tells him to do as \"I like...\" followed by whatever Julien said. In the episode \"Haunted Habitat\" he mentioned that he had a dream that he was \"The last mammal on Earth\". Mort was just happy to be in the dream despite that he was \"road kill\" in it.\n\nA recurring gag in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' series is that Julien believes in [[Spirit|supernatural beings]], which sometimes annoys the other animals. In the episode ''Misfortune Cookie'', Rico gets a fortune cookie that reads \"You will soon meet a fowl end.\" The penguins deny that fortune cookies have any power, despite receiving three accurate fortunes, and dismiss it as superstition. Julien exclaims \"these stitions are super,\" and tries to get the penguins to believe in the supernatural. King Julien actively plots to make a \"foul end\" fortune come true - by his own doing. It is also known that his believing in spirits can be used against him, seeing that Mason and Phil tricks Julien into believing that the \"sky spirits\" are angry with the Julien self-centrism, thing that change Julien's personality. But when Skipper notices that kind Julien is more annoying than the [[narcissist]] Julien, Skipper makes him come back to his original self.\n\nIt is also shown that Julien gains a super-lemur level of strength if he gets mad. Visible when in \"Miracle on Ice\", Julien spanked and humiliated the Rat King, after one of his henchmen touched Julien's feet; In Happy King Julien Day, Maurice claims that Julien violently used a cane to spank everyone who forgot his self-proclaimed holiday.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', he has a bigger role and falls in love with Sonya the Bear. Also, he saved the day by managing to get back to the circus.\n\n====Maurice====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Maurice\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Cedric the Entertainer]] (films and TV specials)<br />John Cothran, Jr. (first video game)<br />[[Fred Tatasciore]] (second and third video games)<br />[[Kevin Michael Richardson]] (television)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Aye-aye]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMaurice is an overweight [[aye-aye]], although he lacks the aye-aye's distinctive middle finger.\n\nMaurice is King Julien's advisor - although Julien seldom listens to him - and often shows skepticism of his ruler's mad plans. He has a long squirrel-like bushy tail. He lived in a tribe of other lemurs and witnessed newcomers to their home: a quartet of zoo animals. Maurice was suspicious of Alex, a lion, thinking him to be potentially dangerous. Maurice expressed this concern during a meeting of the lemurs and jungle animals, but was ignored by Julien. The next day, Maurice took part in the festival honoring the newcomers. During the festival, his suspicions about Alex become confirmed as Alex starts to give into his natural predatory instincts, and shortly after explained the trouble with having a lion around. He knew that Alex would need to eat meat, and felt that Alex should leave and go to the carnivore side of the island.\n\nShortly after, Maurice witnessed Gloria, Melman, and Marty working with a group of penguins to fight off the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] that were attacking the lemur tribe. Maurice had to admit that King Julien's plan had worked and that fossa would no longer be of any worry. Maurice saw the newcomers out when they decided to leave and was obligated to wave King Julien's arm for him, as the king was tired of waving it.\n\nIn the sequel ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', Maurice does not have a prominent role, basically agreeing to whatever King Julien says. In the series, he often acts like a strict big brother to Mort and knows him so well that in \"The Penguin Stays in the Picture\" he is shocked to find that Mort only ate half of his popsicle, prompting Skipper to go find him because he suspected Mort went missing, which was correct.\n\nHe is shown to have many hidden talents in several episodes such as painting and speaking chameleon in \"The Hidden\" and using a yo-yo in \"Friend-in-a-Box.\" In \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel,\" his desire to control an army of Julien man-servants is revealed. Despite being overweight, he was still able to hold his own when he got into a physical fight with Kowalski and Rico in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel.\" He has shown attraction to Darla the Baboon.\n\nMaurice returns with a much smaller role in ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,'' where he and the other two lemurs join the zoosters in catching up with the penguins and chimps. After joining the circus, the trio of lemurs fall into a crate holding Sonya the bear. Julien falls in love with Sonya, weirding-out Maurice and Mort. The two don't show up again until the end of the movie where they gun Dubois with a tranquilizer dart.\n\n====Mort====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Mort\n| series             = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice              = [[Andy Richter]] (most media) <br />[[Dee Bradley Baker]] (first video game)<br />[[Matt Nolan (American actor and singer)|Matt Nolan]] (second and third video games)\n| lbl21              = Species\n| data21             = [[Goodman's mouse lemur]]\n| first              = [[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]] (2005)\n| creator            = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\n\nThough quite timid, Mort can also be shrill and vocal in confrontations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Julien finds Mort incredibly annoying, and does not hesitate in proclaiming so. Despite this, Mort does not show any lasting unhappiness, and his expression changes within the same scene.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A running gag is that Mort commonly pukes. Mort has an [[foot fetish|obsession with Julien's feet]] ever since he used them to kick some fossa as seen in the first episode of ''[[All Hail King Julien]]''. Mort also has very good money skills as in the episode \"Gimme Gimme Gimme: The Game\" where he cleverly becomes the richest lemur in Madagascar (all the other lemurs became broke including Julien after getting all their money and possessions but gives it all back after Julien, defeated, says that he had won showing that he believed that it was all a game). In the episode \"Oh Captain, Muy Captain (Part 2)\", is revealed that Mort was a fearsome pirate named Dread Pirate Mort at some point. In every episode, Mort was able to develop different personalities such as Smart Mort and his Evil Grammy which resulted in his personality disorder. During the events of \"Exiled\", it is revealed that Mort is an immortal transdimentional being and all of his alternate personalities are dimensional counterparts who he defeated and absorbed their life essence. By the end of the season, he marries the mountain lemur Zora but later break up in Season 5.\n\nIn ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' episode \"Sting Operation\" when the penguins turn into idiots, they had the same obsession for feet just like him, which Julien despises. In his anger, Julien once banished Mort from their habitat at the zoo, forcing Mort to seek a \"cure\" from the Penguins.<ref name=\"Feet\"/>\n\nMort makes his first appearance in ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', wherein he has a minor role. He lives among the other native lemurs under Julien. Julien uses him as a test to see if Alex and the others eat lemurs, and Mort quickly decides that he likes them, as he is later shown to have a tendency to like everything. Later, Julien notes that if Alex does not like fish and still hungers for steak, Mort is \"Plan B\". Mort is last seen in the film with the other lemurs wishing the zoo animals farewell, and Julien uses him as a makeshift foot-rest.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Mort plays a much larger role. He attempts to follow Julien and Maurice on the penguins' plane, but Julien goes to extremes to keep him out of the plane, declaring that Mort had \"scissors and hand cream\" (he did in fact, have a pair of scissors, however he lacked any hand cream on the journey). {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Mort succeeds in attaching himself to the outside of the plane, where he is seen by Alex (parodying a scene of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''{{'}}s episode ''Nightmare at 20.000 feet''), before falling into the ocean shortly before it crashed. After reaching a shore at Africa, Mort is pursued by a persistent shark, which follows him onto the African preserve. Mort (still followed by the shark) finds Julien at a volcano where Melman had just decided that he would not sacrifice himself to return the preserve's water. The shark accidentally falls into the volcano just as Alex and Zuba destroy the dam blocking the river, thus leading Julien to believe that his plan to give a sacrifice to bring back the water was successful.\n\nMort makes appearances through ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'', along with Julien and Maurice. At one point, stuffed \"Mort\" dolls became very popular, and out of jealousy Julien throws them into the skunk habitat.<ref name=\"Plush\">{{cite episode| title = Operation: Plush and Cover | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = March 30, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 4}}</ref> Mort is accidentally shipped back to the factory with the dolls, and must be rescued. In the episode, King Julien also reveals that the only reason he allows Mort to stay with them is so he can express his dislike for Mort in front of him, and keep himself entertained.<ref name=\"Feet\"/> Mort is also shown to be unhappy with his past self after growing in size and muscle mass due to an invention from Kowalski. After being turned back into his regular self, Mort expresses that he is happy with who he is.<ref name=\"Unbound\">{{cite episode| title = Mort Unbound | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = June 26, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 21}}</ref> In the television series, whenever an animal or object is falling it almost always lands on Mort. Despite the fact that Mort is often treated poorly by King Julien, the other characters show concern for him as Maurice tries to (if with limited success) save Mort when he may be in danger to be King Julien's biggest concern, and Skipper, who refers to Mort as \"sad-eyes\", dived in the way of the mutant rat overlord to save Mort. In the episode \"Otter Woman\", all the boys are attracted to Marlene because her fur turned white. Mort tries the same thing in the end of the episode, without success.\n\nMort returned in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. Things he does in it involve vomiting on Alex's birthday cake, helping Alex defeat Dubois early on in the film, being part of the flying [[Afro]] Circus with the other lemurs, and tranquilizing Dubois with knockout darts.\n\n===Mason and Phil===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Mason and Phil\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Conrad Vernon]] (Mason)<br />(Phil is an unvoiced character)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Common chimpanzee|Chimpanzee]]s\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMason and Phil are two sophisticated [[common chimpanzee]]s at the Central Park Zoo, who prefer to drink cups of [[coffee]] and \"read\" the newspaper in the morning. Mason speaks with a [[Received Pronunciation|stereotypical British accent]]; Phil, by contrast, doesn't speak at all and communicates entirely through [[American Sign Language]], though whether he is actually deaf is unknown. While Mason is unable to read, Phil can and is used to decipher writing while Mason translates the ASL. Both escape the zoo after Gloria breaks through its outer wall; Mason mentions [[Tom Wolfe]] giving a lecture, and they plan to attend to \"throw poo at him.\"<ref name=\"throw\">{{cite video |date=November 15, 2005 |title=Madagascar |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/ |medium=DVD |publisher=DreamWorks |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |quote=\"I heard Tom Wolfe is speaking at Lincoln Center.\" / \"Well of course we're going to throw poo at him!\"}}</ref> Along with other characters, Phil and Mason are captured and sent to a wildlife reserve.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} However, their crates are not thrown off the boat, and they are not seen until a final scene, in which they are still in crates waving farewell to the Madagascar natives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', the chimps call upon chimpanzees living in Africa to help rebuild the wrecked plane that was supposed to fly them back to New York.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} They later go on strike, asking for [[maternity leave]]s and breaks (Skipper argues that they are all males); eventually, they [[blackmail]] Skipper into agreeing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', Mason and Phil are supporting characters in the series, and are shown to be annoyed by Julien's partying. They attempt to rid him of his ways by tricking Julien into thinking a solar eclipse was a sign that the \"sky spirits\" disapproved of his behavior.<ref name=\"Eclipse\">{{cite episode| title = Eclipsed | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = June 6, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 20}}</ref> They also frequently mention throwing poo and are used to read the English language. Phil may be the most temperamental or \"potty mouthed\" of the two, as after being told there is no checkmate in checkers, he makes several signs which Mason responds with \"You groom your mother with those hands?!\" Phil and Mason may also sometimes lose things in the translation of what they are made to read. An instance of this is when the zoo occupants were ordered to make a cake for King Julien, and Mason mistakes \"booger\" for \"sugar\". This does not mean that Phil is unable to communicate well, even though he is unable to truly speak, he was still able to win over the heart of Lulu, a female chimp visiting from the Hoboken Zoo in New Jersey for a weekend, While Lulu did appear in a later episode where the penguins ended up accidentally finding themselves in the Hoboken Zoo, it is unknown if she keeps in touch with Phil.\n\nMcGrath explained that originally their \"first scene was just deciphering the code on the shipping label\".<ref name=\"background\" /> The crew \"got this girl who knew American Sign Language\" to give them hand gestures. They wanted gestures to be \"really frenetic\", and \"she signed out, 'Tell the tiny pea-brained birds that the sign reads: Ship to...{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"background\" /> Afterward, the crew returned to the scene where Mason notes Tom Wolfe's lecture, and she signed \"Can we throw our poo at his stupid white suit?\"<ref name=\"background\" /> Mason is named after legendary British actor [[James Mason]], whose urbane, sophisticated vocal styling is mimicked by Vernon.\n\nIn ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'' Mason and Phil have smaller roles and are mostly seen posing as the King of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].\n\nThey make a cameo appearance on a newspaper in ''[[Turbo (film)|Turbo]]''.\n\n===Circus Zaragoza Animals===\nThe animals of Circus Zaragoza are trained circus performers that Alex's group had met while on the run from Chantel DuBois. Among the animals of Circus Zaragoza are:\n\n====Vitaly====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Vitaly\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Bryan Cranston]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Siberian tiger]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nVitaly is a muscular [[Siberian tiger]] with a Russian accent who leads a traveling circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.\n\nThe tough Vitaly once jumped through flaming rings of fire to excite crowds, constantly pushing himself to the limit by jumping through smaller and smaller rings that seemed impossible for his size while lubricating himself with olive oil. But after losing his confidence and more than a few of his hairs on one fateful attempt which involved a flaming ring that would only fit on the smallest finger (due to the olive oil being flammable), he also lost his passion and his act partially. When Alex and his friends plead with the circus to let them escape on their train, Vitaly is the most resistant, only to be overruled by Gia. When the zoo animals purchase the circus, Vitaly remains the most hostile to their changes to the business, even as the rest of the crew becomes inspired.\n\nIn London, Vitaly decides to give up and prepares to leave just before the circus' critical performance. Alex confronts Vitaly and reminds the tiger of his love of performing and while suggesting he uses [[hair conditioner]] as a safer lubricant before regaining his courage to jump through the tiny flaming [[wikt:hoop|hoop]]. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly to open the successful show. With that, a profoundly heartened Vitaly becomes a fast friend of Alex. Even after the zoo animals are exposed and estranged from the circus, Vitaly is the first to support Gia's proposal to rescue their new friends from the zoo and plays a key role in that operation.\n\n====Gia====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Gia\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Jessica Chastain]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Jaguar]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n| nationality = Italian\n}}\nGia is a [[jaguar]] with an Italian accent who is part of the traveling circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. She wears a blue woven floral [[necklace]], has gold eyes and has heart-shaped palms. She is Alex's love interest who is always on the lookout to discover something new and gets her chance when she convinces a reluctant Alex to teach her the trapeze \u2013 \"Circus Americano\" style. Her only role in the circus before Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria came around was doing normal cat tricks (sitting, standing, rolling over), but when Alex teaches her trapeze, she performs with him and they move closer. Later on, she and the other circus animals save Alex and the gang from Dubois.\n\n====Stefano====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Stefano\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Martin Short]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[sea lion]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n| nationality = Italian\n}}\nStefano is a [[sea lion]] with an Italian accent and curly whiskers. He is part of the traveling circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' and is a happy, fun-loving Italian sea lion who always looks on the brighter side of things. A true entertainer at heart, he is up for any challenge to save the circus, even convincing Alex that the show must go on.\n\n====Sonya====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Sonya\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Frank Welker]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Eurasian brown bear]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nSonya is the traveling circus' most ferocious [[Eurasian brown bear]] who appears in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. Her tricycle riding act is only topped by her ridiculous [[tutu (clothing)|tutu]]. But her biggest trick of all will be casting a spell on King Julien, who is instantly smitten with her. She does not talk nor is anthropomorphic like most of the other characters, but Julien can understand what she is saying when she growls (the way she communicates instead).\n\nWhile they are in [[Rome]], she and Julien travel to [[Vatican City]] where they steal the [[Pope]]'s ring after Julien pretends to kiss it and uses it to buy her a [[Ducati]] motorbike after they fall down a set of stairs and destroy her tricycle, which she uses in her performance in [[London]].\n\n====The Andalusian Triplets====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = The Andalusian Triplets<br />Esperanza, Esmeralda and Ernestina\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Paz Vega]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Andalusian horse]]s\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nEsperanza, Esmeralda, and Ernestina (voiced by [[Paz Vega]]) are three of the new characters in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. They are [[White (horse)|white]] [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian Mares]] who like Marty and are part of the circus. All their names start with \"E\" and end with \"A\". When Alex's group improved the Circus Zaragoza, the Andalusian Triplets bounced on the trampolines during their act while wearing butterfly wings on their outfits.\n\nThey were listed as \"Horses\" in the credits.\n\n====The Dancing Dogs====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = The Dancing Dogs<br />Frankie, Freddie, Jonesy and Shakey\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Nick Fletcher]] (Frankie)<br />[[Vinnie Jones]] (Freddie)<br />[[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] (Jonesy)<br />[[Jules de Jongh]] (Shakey)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Entlebucher Mountain Dog]] (Frankie)<br />[[Great Dane]] (Freddie)<br />[[Bernese Mountain Dog]] (Jonesy and Shakey)<br />[[Beagle]] (Bobby)<br />[[Dachshund]] (Sammy)\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nThe Dancing Dogs are a group of six performing [[dog]]s with British accents as members of the circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. They tend to fight and argue with each other and they hate being called cute and cuddly. The Dancing Dogs consist of Frankie the [[Entlebucher Mountain Dog]] (voiced by [[Nick Fletcher]]), Freddie the [[Great Dane]] (voiced by [[Vinnie Jones]]), Jonesy the [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] (voiced by [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]), Shakey the Brown [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] (voiced by [[Jules de Jongh]]), Bobby the [[Beagle]], and Sammy the [[Dachshund]]. Only the first three are credited.\n\n====Manu and Maya====\nManu and Maya are two performing [[Indian elephant]]s as members of Circus Zaragoza in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.\n\nTheir names are revealed in the DVD commentary as well as the fact that they are German. According to Tom McGrath, they are very nice and great to work with. They remain silent in the film due to the fact that their possible dialogue was cut from the film.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Ted===\nTed (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) is a [[polar bear]] who lives in the Central Park Zoo. He first appeared in \"[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]\" where he was sad due to be alone during Christmas. This caused Private to want to give him a present. When Skipper denied him his request, Private snuck out into the city to find Ted a gift only to be kidnapped by Nana. After getting Private back, the other penguins decided to invite Ted to their Christmas party where the polar bear had invited the rest of the Zoo as the animals present sing their rendition of \"Jingle Bells.\"\n\nHe made a brief background cameo in the first movie.\n\nIn the series, he mainly appears as a background zoo animal. He did play a small role in the episode \"P.E.L.T.\" when Skipper had to provoke and evade a polar predator.\n\n===Zuba===\nZuba (voiced by [[Bernie Mac]] in the film, Dan White in the video game) is a [[lion]] who is Alex's father and the alpha lion of the pride in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''.\n\nHe was first seen as the Alpha Lion of a pride in the reserve where Alex was born. At first, he thinks that Alex has returned to take over, but his wife notices that they both have the same birthmark and realizes that Alex is their son. Zuba is a proud father, but he is somewhat confused as to why his son is interested in [[dancing]]. After many events in the movie including Alex failing the rite of passage and shaming his family, Zuba finally accepts Alex. The film was dedicated to Mac's memory.\n\n===Florrie===\nFlorrie (voiced by [[Sherri Shepherd]]) is Alex's mother, Zuba's wife, and the alpha [[lion]]ess of the pride in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''. Florrie, unlike Zuba, accepts Alex for what he is. She is not disturbed at all by the fact that Alex prefers to dance instead of fight. Due to this, she acts as the voice of reason and tries to encourage Zuba that it is better that Alex came back to them, dancer or not, as a king. Florrie is never addressed by her name in the film and in the movie's end credits, she is credited as \"Mom\". It is presumably in the novelization that her name is revealed.\n\n===Moto Moto===\nMoto Moto (voiced by [[will.i.am]] in the film, [[Greg Eagles]] in the video game) is a chunky, handsome and muscular [[hippopotamus]] with an attractive deep voice, who is very attracted to 'big and chunky' females. In ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', he courts and romantically pursues Gloria. However, eventually, Gloria realizes that Moto Moto only loves her because of her large body, and Gloria breaks up with him as a result, though they remain friends.\nMoto Moto is mentioned to mean \"Hot Hot\" in Swahili. He has also become an [[internet meme]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTTAq_JOUjk</ref>\n\n===Okapi Girl===\nAn unnamed female [[Okapi]] (voiced by [[Taraji P. Henson]]) appears in ''[[Madly Madagascar]]'', whom Marty finds himself in love with. She is not interested until he uses a love potion on himself, causing her and all the other female animals to begin pampering him. She and the other animals lose interest in him after he jumps into a lake to hide from them (due to becoming overwhelmed by the pampering), causing the potion to wash off.\n\n===North Wind===\nNorth Wind is an [[Arctic]] elite undercover interspecies task force that is dedicated to helping animals that can't help themselves. They worked with the Penguins in order to thwart the plans of the villain Dave (aka Dr. Octavius Brine). Among the members of North Wind are:\n\n====Classified====\nClassified (voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) is a courageous yet slightly arrogant British [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]] and the [[Leadership|team leader]] of North Wind.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> He is at loggerheads with Skipper. Skipper calls him Classified, who states his name isn't really \"Classified\". His name is classified (as in \"top secret\") because he is the leader of the team. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Skipper.\n\n====Short Fuse====\nShort Fuse (voiced by [[Ken Jeong]]) is a Belgian [[harp seal]]. He is the North Wind's explosive and demolitions expert. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Rico.\n\n====Eva====\nEva (voiced by [[Annet Mahendru]]) is a Russian [[snowy owl]] and North Wind's intelligence analyst. Kowalski has a crush on her. She is the North Wind's counterpart of Kowalski.\n\n====Corporal====\nCorporal (voiced by [[Peter Stormare]]) is a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and the muscle of the North Wind team. He seems to like penguins and he freaks out when other penguins are taken. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Private (loosely, as he's also able to fight well, but shows affection at a great level, like Private.)\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===Nana===\nNana (voiced by [[Elisa Gabrielli]] in the films, [[Marion Ross]] in the second video game) is an elderly lady with a Yiddish accent and the [[archenemy]] of Alex the lion.\n\nNana's personality changes over her appearances. Initially, she appears as a very aggressive old lady with incredible martial arts skills. In ''The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper'', she is shown to be aggressive with anyone, no matter how courteous people are with her. But in ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', she appears to be kinder than before, even leading the New Yorkers when she notices that they are in panic, only being aggressive with wild animals; which she sees as no different from domestic animals. She is also shown to be a soft and grandmotherly figure to the New Yorkers. For example, when a man helps her find her handbag, she says, \"Such a good boy. Nana can't survive without it.\"\n\nNana seems to be incredibly resistant to injury, as she was able to have another fight with Alex right after being tugged out of the back of a speeding tour jeep as well as being thrown through the windshield a second time by the penguins, who reversed over her in the jeep after noticing that she did not die. Despite her martial arts skills, she is still portrayed as a \"little old lady\"; she has a waddling gait, wears dentures, and is knocked onto her back when firing a gun.\n\nIn the first movie, Nana crosses paths with Alex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], then brutally assaults him. Throughout the series, she refers to Alex as \"the bad kitty.\" She also hits Melman with her hand bag, causing his head to get stuck in the Grand Central Station Clock. When the animals are surrounded by police, she somehow gets past and kicks Alex in \"the batteries\" (or his groin). She was quickly taken away by police. As shown in the sequel, she was not arrested, she was interviewed as a witness, and states what she thought of Alex: \"He was a very bad kitty.\"\n\nNana is featured in ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]'', where she proves that there are times when she is shown to be not only aggressive with animals, but with also people, like when she destroys random merchandise at a kiosk while shopping for her dog, then demands to purchase Private in a very rude tone, when she refuses to pay the taxi driver her fare, when she tells her doorman to \"buzz off\" and then punches him in the face for no reason, and even when she does not hold the elevator for Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico.\n\nNana returns in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''. She also becomes the leader of an army of tourists left stranded by the penguins' schemes. She again crosses paths with Alex, then fights him, and wins again, although Alex puts up much more of a fight this time (although Alex confesses to his friends that he actually only did it to distract her to get her bag, making Nana's victory unofficial). She often hits Alex and loves her handbag. At the end of the film, Alex gives Makunga Nana's handbag. When she sees Makunga holding it, she kicks him in the groin, steps on his foot, whacks his hand with a ruler, digs her hand into his ear, arm-burns him, and spanks him before dragging him off the reserve by his ear. According to the DVD commentary, she took Makunga back to New York with her in a kitty cage.\n\nNana's assault on Alex at Grand Central Station is mentioned by a taxi driver in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' episode \"Zoo Tube\".\n\nNana does not appear in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.\n\n====Mr. Chew====\nMr. Chew (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a small, white [[poodle]], fond of chewing and tearing various items apart (as demonstrated on an Alex plush toy). Chew is owned by Nana, and lives in her apartment on the top floor in an apartment complex. Nana purchased Private, mistaking him for a [[squeaky toy]], while he was attempting to find a gift for Ted, and reveals him to be a Christmas present for Mr. Chew. Chew nearly mauled Private, while Nana was watching a football game on TV, but was defeated by Skipper, Kowalski and Rico, who had set out to rescue Private. Nana does not hear the fight, but after she sees the damage (following hearing Rico's dynamite stick going off), she blames Mr. Chew for destroying her apartment and puts him on a big \"time out\".\n\nMr. Chew had a cameo appearance in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' when an identical poodle was seen as a head trophy owned by Captain Chantel DuBois.\n\n===The Fossa===\nThe [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (voiced by [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] and [[Eric Darnell]] in the film, various voices in ''[[All Hail King Julien]]'') appear as medium-sized weasel-like creatures, closely related to mongoose, and rarely speak, instead usually growling and yelping.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThroughout ''Madagascar'', they are shown to terrorize the lemurs and attempt to eat them. According to Julien, \"they're always annoying us [the lemurs] by trespassing, interrupting our parties, and ripping our limbs off.\"<ref name=\"limb\">{{cite video |date=November 15, 2005 |title=Madagascar |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/ |medium=DVD |publisher=DreamWorks |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |quote=They're always annoying us by trespassing, interrupting our parties, and ripping our limbs off.}}</ref> The fossa are fearful of Alex, and run away when they suspect an attack from him, as well as allow him to take their prey.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The fossa are defeated by Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, and the penguins and driven into their territory.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" episode \"The Terror of Madagascar,\" a baby Fossa (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) was shipped to the Central Park Zoo as part of a zoo-to-zoo tour. Throughout the episode, the baby fossa kept biting King Julien. Because of this, he thought that the fossa was trying to eat him. Kowalski told him that this was the fossa's way of showing love towards Julien, since he thought of him as his father. But, Julien realized this too late, because in order to get rid of the fossa, he shipped in a [[boa constrictor]] named Savio to devour him. In order to keep the fossa safe, Julien wanted Savio to eat him instead, but the fossa attacked Savio to protect Julien, much to the penguins' disappointment.\n\nThe Fossa are recurring characters in ''All Hail King Julien''. During his reign, King Julien's uncle King Julien XII had kept the lemur kingdom quiet in order to keep the Fossa from attacking them. His uncle gives Julien the crown after learning that the king of the lemurs will be eaten by the Fossa. But Julien got bitten on the butt, while saving the lemurs and his scream sent boulders falling down and the Fossa run away. Throughout the first movie and the two TV series, there have been male Fossa. In the fifth episode of ''All Hail King Julien'' there is a Fossa girl who flirts with Julien and Maurice in a Fossa suit. She is seen in the end cuddling the suit with Julien's uncle in it who is being punished and sparred by Julien, for sending his nephew to the territory and trying to reclaim the throne. Julien is, at one point, able to tame a Fossa girl named Mary Anne who later becomes a partial leader of the Fossa.\n\n===Makunga===\nMakunga (voiced by [[Alec Baldwin]] in the film, [[John Cygan]] in the video game) is a male [[lion]] with a large black mane styled in a pompadour and green eyes. He is Zuba's rival and wants to take his place as alpha lion. He also calls Alex pathetic. When asked why he wants to become alpha lion, he replies \"I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart, and I want everyone else to do what I say\" Makunga usually acts like he thinks he is smart and has good leadership, but he only is trying to become alpha lion because he wants to be in charge. Makunga often looks at other characters while making an evil unnoticed face where he crosses his arms in front of his chest and makes a big [[smirk]], usually when he is planning to do something that is not good (in this manner, he is very similar to [[List of The Lion King characters|Scar]] from ''[[The Lion King]]\").\n\nHis name sounds a little to \"Wakunga\", (singular: \"Mkunga\") which means \"midwives\" in Swahili.\n\nMakunga often challenged Zuba to fights over the alpha lion position, but was easily beaten. One of those fights led to Zuba being distracted while Alex was captured by poachers. Years later, Makunga used Alex in a bid to finally reach the rank of alpha lion where he tricked Alex into challenging his henchman Teetsi. When Alex was defeated, Zuba reluctantly had to give up his alpha lion status and go into exile with his family. Makunga is not a very good leader saying the only solution to the fact that the local water hole was nearly dry was that they all would have to fight for it. This causes doubt about his role as alpha lion, and almost every animal on the reserve wants Zuba back. After the water was restored, he still refused to allow Zuba and Alex to return from banishment.\nHe eventually meets his downfall when being tricked into angering Nana, who attacks Makunga and drags him off the reserve by his ear. The DVD commentary reveals that \"Nana brought Makunga to New York in a kitty cage\".\n\n====Teetsi====\nTeetsi (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) is Makunga's henchman and the strongest lion in his group. Makunga tricked Alex by suggesting that he goes up against Teetsi. Alex ended up defeated by Teetsi.\n\n===Captain Chantel DuBois===\nCaptain Chantel DuBois (voiced by [[Frances McDormand]]) is a [[Principality of Monaco|Monegasque]] [[animal control officer]]. She is the best [[animal control officer]] in [[Monte Carlo]] with a perfect success record. She is a big-game hunter and has extraordinary tracking skills, as well as superhuman strength and a habit of mounting the heads of every animal she has caught on her wall. Like Nana, she is incredibly resistant to injury. Throughout the third film, she pursues the Four in hopes of having their heads as trophies, especially Alex's. The obstacles DuBois avoid during her and her team's chase behind the animals' [[SUV]] in Monte Carlo are sliding past some omega-3 fish being spilled on the road while carrying her scooter up high, driving from one building to the other [in slow motion] after jumping off her scooter (where the animals are preparing to get on the plane), and doing some stunts in an office building.\n\nShe finally captured Alex and the other animals at [[New York City]], and the zoo staff thank her incorrectly believing that she tried to return Alex. She rips up the check they give her where she says that \"It wasn't about the money. It was about the lion.\" Alex is caged and DuBois hides a poison filled dart in a foam finger and shoots it at him, but the circus animals, being alerted by King Julien, arrive and rescue him. After a long fight between the animals and DuBois and her henchmen, DuBois is tranquilized by Mort and her men are knocked out. She and her men are last seen shipped to Madagascar with her henchmen (similar to the first movie) thanks to the Penguins.\n\n====DuBois' Men====\nDuBois' Men are four men of Captain DuBois' animal control officers. They are prone to getting hurt, unlike their boss. However, even when they ''do'' get hurt, DuBois can heal them instantly simply by singing \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]],\" thereby appealing to their patriotism. One is short, one is tall and skinny with a mustache (on an extra released on the DVD reveals his name is Gerard), one is overweight with a goatee and sideburns, and one is also overweight and has a mustache.\n\n===Dave / Dr. Octavius Brine===\nDave (voiced by [[John Malkovich]]) is a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who appears in [[Penguins of Madagascar]] as the main antagonist. He disguises himself as a human professor under the alias of Dr. Octavius Brine. Dave used to be one of the top attractions at the Central Park Zoo, in which time he entertained children with his clever and funny tricks. However, when Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private arrived, they unknowingly stole all his glory due to their cuteness and he was forcibly removed from his home. Afterwards, Dave was shipped to every major Zoo in the world, but the same thing happened again and again and again: penguins getting all the attention while Dave was shunned, ignored and neglected. Embittered, Dave now seeks revenge on the penguin species, becoming a [[mad scientist]] in the process.\n\nInside his submarine lair, Dave creates the [[Medusa]] serum, a green substance that when fired in a ray will transform its target into a physically and mentally disfigured monster. He plans to use it on all the penguins that stole his fame and then unleash the now monstrous penguins on New York city, so that the humans will despise them instead of love them. However, a group of Arctic animals called the \"North Wind\" attempt to foil his plans.\n\nAt the end of the film, Dave's plan for revenge is foiled and the vengeful octopus is shrunk by his own ray (the effects having been reversed by Private) and gets trapped in a snow globe, where he is admired by a little girl.\n\n====Dave's Henchmen====\nDave's Henchmen are octopuses. They are evil minions who work for Dave and assist him in his plans to rid of all penguins. They don't speak, but they make a bubbling sound that Dave understands. Each henchman share the first names of famous celebrities. Whenever Dave ordered them to do something, he would say the actor's first name and an action word that spells out the actors' full names (Ex. \"[[Nicolas Cage|Nicolas, cage]] them.\" \"[[Elijah Wood|Elijah, would]] you please take them away?\" \"[[Halle Berry|Halle, bury]] them.\"). About three of these underlings are named after the actors.\n\n==Characters in ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' TV series==\n\n===Marlene===\nMarlene (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]] in normal form, [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in wild form) is the Central Park Zoo's only resident [[Oriental small-clawed otter]] with primarily brown fur, with a white chest, face, and right foot. Marlene is shown to be both playful<ref name=\"Crown\">{{cite episode| title = Crown Fools | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 9, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 11}}</ref> and kind towards others, which often conflicts with Skipper's serious and safety-cautious attitude.<ref name=\"Hidden\">{{cite episode| title = The Hidden | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 18, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 12}}</ref> Though this is true, the two still share a very strong friendship with one another and still have the ability to keep that certain bond exceedingly strong, making it rather difficult to break. She attempts to find and bring out the best in others through kindness, though is not immune to feeling anger towards Rhonda, a rude walrus apathetic to others, and works to have her transferred (she regrets the decision after learning Rhonda would be sent to a polar bear reserve, and works doggedly to send her elsewhere).<ref name=\"Popcorn\" /> Despite having doubts on the penguins' ways of dealing with issues, Marlene still believes that they can accomplish very difficult tasks.<ref name=\"Feet\">{{cite episode| title = Two Feet High and Rising | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 7, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 9}}</ref> Marlene is known to snore very loudly while asleep, which invokes fear in an alligator named Roger residing in the sewer system beneath her enclosure.<ref name=\"Haunted\">{{cite episode| title = Haunted Habitat | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = March 28, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> Like other residents at the zoo, Marlene is shown to love both popcorn<ref name=\"Popcorn\">{{cite episode| title = Popcorn Panic | episodelink = List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep16 | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = May 9, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 16}}</ref> and candy. In order to get candy, she is bribed by Maurice to celebrate King Julien Day and participate in several tasks to keep Julien content.<ref name=\"JulienDay\">{{cite episode| title = Happy King Julien Day | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = March 31, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 5}}</ref> Marlene has also revealed that she won the Internet popularity contest at her past zoo three years in a row (though was unable to compete at the Central Park Zoo due to a scandal)<ref name=\"Tangled\">{{cite episode| title = Tangled in the Web | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 8, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 10}}</ref> and that she considers [[Christmas in July]] \"the biggest holiday of the year\".<ref name=\"JulienDay\"/>\n\nIn \"Otter Gone Wild\", it is revealed that she was born in captivity. When she sets foot in the outside world, she becomes wild. In her primal state, she briefly becomes [[infatuated]] with King Julien, and is capable of posing a significant threat even to the equally-psychotic Rico in a fight, later successfully defeating two enraged badgers who had just given the entire penguin team significant trouble.\n\nIn \"Otter Things Have Happened\", the penguins invented a machine that is able to locate anyone's ideal match at a moment's notice; the birds misread the signal her saliva sample gave and present her with Fred the squirrel, upsetting Julien who kidnaps the little guy (who Marlene has actually started to like). When she realizes Fred is not good for her, she dumps Fred and goes back to her single lifestyle. Kowalski, upset that his invention is faulty, throws it out. In the trash the machine begins to show the results of Marlene's test again; we see Fred in the area it was picking up, but then are treated to the introduction of a brand new character, Antonio or the \"Otter Bachelor of Central Park\", a buff, Latino male otter who has a fancy to frequently playing his Spanish guitar. It is not finalized, but it seems that Antonio was the individual who Marlene's test picked up, not Fred. It is not known yet if the penguins know of Antonio's existence or if Marlene will get to meet him in future episodes but in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel\" it is shown that Marlene dreams of being in a spacious room surrounded by many otters very similar (if not exactly like) Antonio all playing Spanish Guitars.\n\nIn \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\", it is shown that she believes Dr. Blowhole is not real. In \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole,\" she saw that he was real, though made no comment concerning any prior disbelief.\n\nDuring \"The Otter Woman\", an over-chlorinated pool resulted in Marlene's fur being bleached white, causing her to be mistaken for an [[arctic mink]] called \"Arlene,\" resulting in Skipper and Julien becoming infatuated with her before Skipper became convinced that \"Arlene\" had done something horrible to the seemingly missing Marlene. Later, Marlene's fur was dyed back to its original color by Alice when she noticed what happened to Marlene.\n\nIn \"Littlefoot,\" Marlene was separated from her feral self thanks to Kowalski's latest invention, but the separation resulted in her monstrous alter-ego going on the rampage while 'regular' Marlene was now excessively paranoid and afraid of everything around her. Despite Officer X capturing Marlene's feral self and taking her to animal control after feral Marlene went on a rampage that destroyed most of New York- earning the name 'Littlefoot' in the process-, the penguins managed to recombine Marlene's two selves, making Officer X lose his job again, and the experience of confronting her other self allowing Marlene to gain greater control over her feral side.\n\nIn \"Badger Pride,\" Marlene had to put up with the attacks from Becky and Stacy Badger (who are prone to having to put up with badger stereotypes) and her wild side comes in handy when it came to subduing them.\n\n===Alice===\nAlice (voiced by [[Mary Scheer]]) is a [[zookeeper]] exclusive to ''The Penguins of Madagascar''. She seems to dislike aspects of her job, and is happy to have a voice-automated robot guide give directions so she can avoid \"annoying tour group questions\".<ref name=\"Choked\">{{cite episode| title = All Choked Up | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 24, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 14}}</ref> She also does not understand what people enjoy about watching animals on their computer, saying that they do not do anything interesting.<ref name=\"Tangled\"/> Alice is involved in several aspects of the animal's well-being. It's hinted that deep down Alice cares for the zoo animals and only wants what's best for them as she hates it when people feed the animals popcorn, and posts several signs throughout the zoo after catching a child feeding Marlene a kernel. Though this could just be herself keeping her job safe.<ref name=\"Popcorn\"/> Alice is also in charge of gathering the penguins for visits to the veterinarian, and later remarks that they have a dentist appointment (Private then confusedly states that they do not have teeth).<ref name=\"Needle\">{{cite episode| title = Needle Point | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = June 6, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 19}}</ref> Alice and the penguins have a mutual dislike for each other,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and she believes that they are scheming (though she is actually correct in this assumption).<ref name=\"Popcorn\"/> Though another zookeeper can be heard over her walkie-talkie, voiced by John DiMaggio, Alice is usually the only one ever seen on-screen but occasionally an unnamed zoo worker appears sporadically, though his face is always hidden.<ref name=\"Tangled\"/> Unintentionally, Alice won the zoo's internet popularity contest when a camera documenting the animals was accidentally pushed toward her dancing and slapping her [[Buttocks|butt]] in the kitchen.<ref name=\"Tangled\"/> In \"Miss Understanding\", she remarked to a know-it-all kid that the zoo had three male penguins and one female, which turned out to be false (not that she knew or cared, either of which could be true).\n\n===Pervis McSlade===\nPervis McSlade (voiced by [[Gary Cole]]) is the zoo commissioner of the Central Park Zoo.\n\nPervis McSlade first appeared in \"In The Line of Doody.\" He is the commissioner for the Central Park Zoo. He was making an appearance to announce the opening of the Children's Zoo. Skipper saved him from being hit by a pigeon named Frankie.\n\nHe later appears in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" to make Frances Alberta the new zookeeper of Central Park. When he finds out Frances was building bio mechanical androids to replace the animals with, he fired her.\n\n===Zoo Doctor===\nThis unnamed [[Physician|doctor]] (voiced by [[Brian George]] in an Asian-Indian accent) works as a [[veterinary physician|veterinarian]] at the Central Park Zoo. He works in the \"animal care\" building. Unlike Alice, he seems to be quite fond of animals. He is bald and wears a white lab coat. Skipper often voices dislike of him because of his use of needles and when injured, he has been known to try and downplay the injury rather than visit the vet.\n\n===Chuck Charles===\nChuck Charles (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[News presenter|newsman]] who works at Channel-1.\n\nIn \"The All Nighter Before Christmas,\" he mentions that he is so used to talking on television that he has forgotten how to talk normally.\n\nDue to an unknown reason in \"Goodnight and Good Chuck,\" he was fired and replaced with his rival anchor Pete Peters and he got a new job at the zoo as Alice's assistant. But he was sat on by Burt, swung out of control by Bada and Bing, tried to get a chameleon off of his face, being dragged away by a vehicle that drove itself, almost got flushed down a toilet, jumped on by Mort, and got sprayed by the amnesia spray by the Penguins. He tried to get his old job back by exposing the Penguins' operation to the world and he got past Rico, Private and Kowalski. The disc was taken by Pete Peters and Peters aired it. But when the world thought the Penguins' operation was fake, Pete Peters was fired and Chuck Charles was reinstated.\n\n===Rat King===\nThe Rat King (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) is a genetically enhanced, muscular [[Laboratory rat|lab rat]] who resides in the sewer. He constantly torments the penguins and never learns his lesson when he's defeated each time. He even tries to take over their home in a hockey game, but he is defeated by King Julien after Rat King's fellow rats skated over King Julien's feet. Also he is matched power with Skipper.\n\n====Sewer Rats====\nCountless small sewer rats who are friends and minions of Rat King. They are voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n===Officer X===\nOfficer X (voiced by [[Cedric Yarbrough]]) is a New York [[animal control officer]] who has a single-minded focus on removing stray animals from the streets. Officer X is shown to have a [[superhuman]] level of strength, crushing a small metal cage with his bare hands and defeating Joey, who even the penguins could not easily beat, head on, leading Skipper to say Officer X cannot be human.\n\nHe first tangles with the penguins when they interfere with his pursuit of a stray cat, the penguins' friend Max, in the episode \"Cat's Cradle\". When asked by Alice what his real name was, X responds that his mother never told him his real name, instead telling him that it was \"classified.\" Officer X was defeated by a Red Rhodesian Slasher that was painted to look like Max.\n\nX returns in the episode \"What Goes Around\" when he tries to capture the penguins when they are found out of the zoo on the streets of New York, but the subsequent chase results in X losing his job due to the scale of the damage he had caused and the public's lack of belief that penguins were responsible for his actions. He was arrested on vandalism charges creating the mess resulting from his and the penguins' encounter.\n\nHe returns as an exterminator in \"Stop Bugging Me,\" having been forced to work as an [[Pest control|exterminator]] after his previous rampage. He fights with the penguins who are protecting three cockroaches that Rico befriended. X was ready to enact his revenge, only for Private to cause the cockroaches to crawl into his suit causing him to run off. He also lost his mustache in this episode.\n\nIn \"The Officer X Factor,\" he replaces Alice for the weekend when she was sent on a vacation. As a zookeeper, he knew about every inch of the zoo to prevent the penguins' escape into cooler water. He was also expecting that the penguins were going to fly to the [[East River]], but he was defeated there. He landed on the taxi that Alice was returning in as it drives away.\n\nOfficer X attempted to regain his position in \"Littlefoot\" by capturing the monster currently attacking New York (the feral version of Marlene that had been separated from her normal self), but the penguins sabotaged this effort by recombining the two Marlenes, leaving Rico behind to give the impression that X's penguin-related \"insanity\" had prompted him to steal a penguin from the zoo. X loses his job again, leaving him upset.\n\nHis next appearance was in \"A Kipper for Skipper\" where he was working as a [[fishmonger]]. When Kowalski, Rico, and Private were arguing over the fish, X captured the three of them. Luckily, they were able to defeat him by dropping a bowling ball on him.\n\nHe was briefly seen in \"Goodnight and Good Chuck\" in which a video revealing all of the penguins' covert operations were broadcast worldwide. Officer X watched the news segment in Times Square and truimphantly told anyone who would listen that \"I told you!\" and \"I'm not crazy!\". He then calls his mother and tells her to turn on the TV to prove his sanity. Unfortunately, everyone else who watches it believes it to be a news hoax due to the sheer impossibility of the scenario and the amusing antics of the penguins in the video. Officer X drops to his knees and cries out in despair when still no one believes him.\n\nIn \"Snowmageddon\", X is now stacking shelves. When Skipper and Marlene go out for a snack run and a snowstorm traps them in the same shop, X manages to capture Skipper, and ties him up with a licorice whip then cages him under a plastic crate, which he sits on while calling animal control. Marlene helps to free Skipper and thanks to the destruction it can be assumed that X has lost his job again.\n\n===Joey===\nJoey (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]]) is a bad tempered and hostile [[red kangaroo]] with an Australian accent that always refers to himself in the third person who loves beating up anyone who steps foot in his habitat, especially [[#Skipper|Skipper]] and Julien. He first appeared in the season one episode, \"Assault and Batteries\" and later on in \"Cat's Cradle\" when he tried to beat up Officer X but was badly hurt instead. He also appeared to have a big role in \"Skorca!\" In the season two episode, \"Kanga-Management\", the Penguins accidentally destroy the Koala habitat, forcing Leonard to temporarily live with Joey until the pen is re-built, to both's dismay. Eventually, the two settle their differences and become friends, agreeing on their hatred for the penguins.\n\nEven though Joey has a pouch that only female kangaroos have, it is assumed by many fans that Joey is a female kangaroo with a masculine voice.\n\n===Leonard===\nLeonard (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]) is an extremely paranoid and nervous [[koala]]. He first appeared in \"Night and Dazed\", where he was shown to be very afraid of the penguins. After being accidentally launched into the city due to Kowalski's evacuation launcher, the penguins come save him and bring him back to the zoo.\n\nHe appears again in \"Kanga Management\" in which the penguins accidentally destroy his enclosure, forcing him to temporarily live in Joey's enclosure. He and Joey eventually become friends due to their hatred for the penguins.\n\nIn \"Nighty Night Ninja\", he watches a martial arts film with the penguins while he waits for his home to air out, due to a fish bomb. This causes him to start attacking the other animals in a sleep-walking state the next day. The penguins cure him by making him watch ''The Lunacorns'', and save him from the sewer rats, whom he had attacked earlier.\n\n===Hans===\nHans (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is a [[puffin]] with a past history with Skipper that involves a mission in [[Denmark]] that somehow resulted in Skipper being declared Public Enemy Number One in the country in question. During \"Huffin & Puffin\", he appeared in New York, initially apparently wanting to make peace with Skipper, before his true agenda was revealed to be his attempt to take control of the Penguins' lair for revenge. With Skipper having infiltrated the lair and defeated Hans, he was then shipped to the [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken Zoo]].\n\nHe appeared in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" and helped the penguins defeat the animal androids who had taken over the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nHe appeared in \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\", working with Doctor Blowhole as part of a plan to take Skipper's memories away.\n\n===Dr. Blowhole===\nDr. Blowhole (voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]) is an evil, mad [[bottlenose dolphin]] scientist and supervillain, who plans to take revenge on the human race: In the past, Blowhole was known as \"Flippy\", and was forced by humans to perform tricks at [[Coney Island]] for their own amusement. Dr. Blowhole is Skipper's arch-nemesis. He only has one (real) eye; his right eye is a robotic one, which hides a scar. He is described by Private and Skipper as being \"pure evil, with skin that's surprisingly pleasant to the touch\", which Blowhole claims is because he always moisturizes. He appears to love rubbing it in that he has far superior technology than the penguins do, which usually gets on Kowalski's nerves. Since he is a dolphin, he gets around by the use of a [[Segway PT|Segway-type]] vehicle while on land, which also projects a glass dome around it and Blowhole to turn into an escape vehicle. He also has a habit of referring to the penguins as \"pen-gyoo-wins\" (it is implied that he only does this to tick them off). Dr. Blowhole has a habit of having his deep-voiced computer announce the names of his creations in a dramatic voice (provided by [[Jim Cummings]]) instead of saying them himself (i.e. Chrome Claw). Unlike most cartoon villains, instead of simply leaving his enemies to die in a deathtrap, he typically stays to oversee their destruction personally, well aware they will likely escape somehow (telling Julien as much when asked), unless he'd be killed as well if he stays (such as locking them in his base as it self-destructs). In the special, the evil dolphin also proved able to hold his own with the combat-trained Skipper in a short physical fight.\n\nDr. Blowhole is mentioned in the episode \"Eclipsed\". Blowhole apparently had a plan to extinguish the Sun, as when Private told him that the sun went dark, Skipper believed that Dr. Blowhole had succeeded in his plan, but actually the sun went dark because of a [[Eclipse|solar eclipse]].\n\nIn \"Roomies\", Blowhole sends a [[walrus]] spy, named Rhonda a.k.a. Agent 12, to steal Kowalski's \"plasma cutter\" invention, which acts as a chain saw. The villainous dolphin himself is never seen the episode.\n\nDr. Blowhole kidnaps King Julien, believing him to be Skipper's best friend, in an effort to lure the flightless force into a trap so that he can annihilate them once and for all. Julien and Blowhole join forces and captures the \"pen-gu-wins\". After Blowhole reveals his plan to activate a \"Ring of Fire\" that he built in the North Pole to flood the world (saying it was inspired by a ring of fire he was forced to jump through when he was in captivity), Mort appears from the lair's skylight and frees the penguins after crashing into a control panel. Blowhole then activates the Ring of Fire after throwing Mort from the control panel. He then sends a giant mutated lobster he devised earlier in the episode called Chrome Claw after Skipper and the penguins (which he'd mentioned he was planning to create during their previous encounter) but they manage to defeat it. After a short battle with Skipper, Blowhole is betrayed by Julien, who claims to have been a double agent the entire time, and the \"Ring of Fire\" (which the media has dubbed the \"Hoop of Heat\", much to Blowhole's anger) is deactivated. Blowhole escapes, promising revenge.\n\nDoctor Blowhole was referenced in \"Invention Intervention\", where Skipper assumed that Kowalski's out-of-control invisible invisibility ray was actually created by Blowhole, commenting that his arch-nemesis had become far more intelligent&nbsp;\u2013 if harder to follow given the lack of motive behind such an attack&nbsp;\u2013 since their last confrontation.\n\nIn \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole\", Dr. Blowhole helps Skipper's rival, Hans the [[Puffin]], escape the [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] Zoo so he can lure Skipper into a trap. Once he ambushed him, he uses his clown-shaped \"Mind Jacker\" to steal Skipper's memories so he can use them to infiltrate the penguins' lair so he can turn them into his monster slaves using his \"Diaboligizer\". When he is about to blast the penguins with the Diaboligizer, he misfires, causing it to hit King Julien's [[MP3 player]] infused with Kowalski's experimental power cell (which Julien foolishly thought was a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]). The mix of the three resulted in a giant MP3 monster, which made everyone near it sing uncontrollably. Blowhole soon decides to use the creature to his advantage by winning it over with his beautiful singing voice. Once he was in control, he started using it to destroy [[New York City]]. Fortunately, Skipper returned to New York with the help of a spirit guide in the form of Alex the lion as seen earlier in the movie. Skipper distracted Blowhole while the penguins took out the source of the monster's power. With Blowhole foiled again and the monster back to normal, he tried to escape, but Skipper activated the Mind Jacker on Blowhole, wiping out his memories. He was soon returned to Coney Island under his old name of Flippy the Dolphin, where he was forced to jump through the Ring of Fire once again.\n\nHe is also mentioned in \"The Big S.T.A.N.K\", where he was the reason that S.T.A.N.K was created, to lure him to the toilet-shaped stink bomb, but the project was abandoned with the realization that dolphins don't use toilets. He was mentioned again in \"Operation: Big Blue Marble\" when Skipper suggested Blowhole as a suspect for the recent environmental chaos and random weather conditions that they were experiencing, but Kowalski confirmed that Blowhole was still at Coney Island as Flippy.\n\nIn \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\", it is revealed that Doris the dolphin (Kowalski's love interest) is his sister and his real name is Francis (which Red One, one of his Lobster minions, laughed off). He only created the name Dr. Blowhole since it earned him more respect.\n\n===Rhonda===\nRhonda (voiced by [[Kathy Kinney]]) is a very rude, unhygenic, lazy and obnoxious [[walrus]] (though she is depicted with buck teeth instead of tusks). She appears in the episode \"Roomies\" where she is transferred into Marlene's habitat. At first Marlene is excited to have another girl to hang out with, but gets annoyed by Rhonda very quickly due to her disgusting and obnoxious behavior. She asks the penguins to ship her out overnight, but stops the shipment after hearing she is getting taken to a polar bear reserve. Instead they send her to the Hoboken Zoo. At the end, we see that she is one of Dr. Blowhole's agents and stole Kowalski's plasma cutter.\n\nShe appears again, as an ally this time, in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" where she Hans, Clemson, Lulu and Savio help the penguins fight off animal androids in the Hoboken Zoo.\n\n===Bada and Bing===\nBada and Bing (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in Brooklyn accents) are giant [[eastern lowland gorilla]]s. Bada is a gray [[gorilla]] and Bing is a brown gorilla. First shown in the \"Kingdom Come\" episode when they served as thuggish bodyguards for Maurice, they have been seen displaying softer sides upon other occasions, such as when they looked after Mort in \"The Penguin Stays in the Picture\" while a photographer was there as an unrequested favor to Private, who wanted to be on the cover of the zoo brochure.\n\nThe two are attacked by a super-enlarged Mort in the episode \"Mort Unbound\" in order for him to get King Julien's stolen mango back.<ref name=\"Mort Unbound\">{{Cite episode|title=Mort Unbound|episodelink=List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep21|series=The Penguins of Madagascar|serieslink=The Penguins of Madagascar|network=[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]|airdate=June 26, 2009|season=1|number=21|minutes=4:18}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Truth Ache,\" it is revealed that Bing sleeps with a stuffed rabbit named Mr. Bunny.\n\n===Burt===\nBurt (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] in the TV series, [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the video games) is an [[Indian elephant]] who was just an extra zoo animal during the beginning of the series, but then evolved into a character of greater focus as the series evolved.\n\nHe was central to the episode \"An Elephant Never Forgets\", in which he leaves the zoo to locate a man who had irritated him as a boy by playing his kazoo at the zoo.\n\nIn the 2005 videogame version of ''Madagascar'', Burt was called Darnell.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBurt is shown to be obsessed with [[peanut]]s, and when he does not eat them, he goes insane as shown in \"Jungle Law\". He nearly eats Julien when he mistakes him for a peanut.\n\nHe played a vital role in the penguins' defeat of the ruthless boa constrictor Savio due to his sheer size preventing Savio from attacking him, squeezing Savio so that the snake's previously-swallowed victims were released.\n\n===Roger===\nRoger (voiced by [[Richard Kind]]) is the penguins' [[American alligator]] friend who [[Sewer alligator|lives in the sewer]]. They meet him in the episode \"Haunted Habitat\" when Skipper and Marlene go to investigate in the sewer under Marlene's habitat because of a strange sound. Roger tells the penguins that he is from Florida and that he was the pet of a young boy until he was flushed into the sewers by the boy's parents.\n\nHe appears again in \"Roger Dodger\" when the Sewer Rats terrorize him. Kowalski swapped his mind with Rico's to drive away the Sewer Rats and then had to work to get their minds back into their respectful bodies. Roger is uncomfortable in Rico's body and keeps regurgitating weapons uncontrollably, despite his pacifist nature.\n\nIn \"Gator Watch,\" the overload of sewage causes problems for Roger at the time when the penguins were visiting him. The penguins had to work to find the right home for him since the \"zoo overlords\" would be surprised at the sudden appearance of Roger. First they tried a park with Roger disguised as a log. A woman recognized him. Then the penguins try to disguise Roger as an exhibit at the museum. Two boys ended up giving Roger away. Another idea was to have Roger pose as a [[gargoyle]] at the top of a building. Roger fell off the building and into a populated swimming pool. This caused the entire city to end up in a Gator Watch which ended with Roger getting captured by animal control at a theater. When the penguins worked to free Roger, the location Roger was taken to was the Central Park Zoo where an alligator habitat has been set up by the zoo staff.\n\nSince then, he has made background appearances.\n\n===Max===\nMax (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]) is the penguins' stray [[tabby cat]] friend who lives in an alley near Central Park. He first meets the four penguins in the episode \"Launchtime\" when the penguins end up on a rooftop across the street from the zoo instead of on the moon. At first, the penguins thought he was a \"mooncat\", but at the end they figure out he was just a stray cat. Max is skinny and hopes to catch a bird in his life. He at first wanted to eat the penguins, but was so touched when he was given a can of fish by them that he became their friend instead. He has a very small cameo in \"The Helmet\".\n\nIn \"Cat's Cradle\", Max tried to escape Officer X. With help from the Penguins, Max and penguins managed to trick Officer X into getting attacked by a wildcat called the Red Rhodesian Slasher.\n\nHe appears once more in \"Street Smarts\" where Max helps the Penguins retrieve Mort from Elmer by teaching them how to be a dog. In the end, Max and Elmer become close friends, but only because Elmer thinks that Max is a lemur.\n\n===Duck Family===\nThe [[American Pekin duck|Duck]] Family are a family of ducks that live in a pond in Central Park.\n\n====Mother Duck====\nMother Duck (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is a white duck who is the mother of Bradley, Samuel, Ramona, and Eggy.\n\n====Eggy====\nEggy (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is a duckling who is the son of Mother Duck and the brother of Ramona, Samuel and Bradley. In \"Paternal Egg-Stinct,\" Marlene found an abandoned egg in her habitat. She gave it to the penguins to look after. Julien wanted the egg for himself. He called it Julien Junior, or JJ for short. Private called the egg Eggy. At the end, Marlene brings Mother Duck to the penguins to get her duckling back.\n\nUnfortunately, the effects of the Penguins' training goes to a point where Mother Duck asks the Penguins to do something to stop him as seen in \"Hard Boiled Eggy.\" Their attempts to show Eggy the dangerous portion of their missions fails, as the duckling goes on a rampage taking down all the animals in the zoo where Eggy inherits the penguins' traits; Skipper's drive, Kowalski's tatical mind, Rico's psychosis and Private's \"fake\" British accent.\n\n====Ramona, Bradley and Samuel====\nRamona, Bradley and Samuel (all three voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]) are ducklings who are Eggy's siblings and Mother Duck's children. Like Eggy's previous personas before becoming more like Julien in Hard Boiled Eggy, they crave action and mayhem.\n\n===Frederico===\nFred (voiced by [[Fred Stoller]]) is a dimwitted [[Eastern gray squirrel|squirrel]] that lives in Central Park and takes everything said literally and has a slow, unemphatic speech pattern. Kowalski met Fred briefly in the \"Otter Gone Wild\" episode, while the full penguin group met him in \"Mask of the Raccoon\" where he is friends with Archie despite the fact that Archie is no good.\n\nHe dated Marlene in \"Otter Things Have Happened\", but she broke up with him because what she had thought was him being funny turned out to be just Fred\u2019s ignorance.\n\nIn \"Field Tripped,\" Julien recruited him to be the 'smart one' of Julien's all-mammal penguin-team-equivalent.\n\nFred was part of a treasure hunt in the episode \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel\".\n\n===Roy===\nRoy (voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) is a short-tempered [[white rhinoceros]], appearing predominantly as an extra zoo animal for the majority of the series. When given more of a role, he often appears to have little-to-no patience for any animal that provokes him, usually responding with threats, such as when a truth-telling Private nearly revealed a secret about him in the \"Truth Ache\" episode involving a \"vacation\" in [[Tijuana]].\n\nHe plays a pivotal role in the \"April Fools\" episode when he threatens Julien with retaliation for drawing on his backside with a permanent marker. It is revealed that he was working with the penguins to teach Julien a lesson for his constant April Fools' Day pranks on everyone in August.\n\nIn \"Antics on Ice\", it was revealed that he is a fan of the Lunacorns series due to their positive focus on a horned animal.\n\nTwice in the episode \"Action Reaction,\" he sat on Julien.\n\n===Pinky===\nPinky (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a sassy [[American flamingo]], who usually only appears as an extra zoo animal in the series. Her only main role, so far, has been in her debut episode \"Go Fish.\" In this episode she was used for aerial support when the penguins wanted to take fish from a fish delivery truck. Somehow she wound up getting all the fish for herself by the end of the episode.\n\nIn the episode \"Operation: Good Deed\" the penguins need one of Pinky's feathers so that Julien would let Maurice massage Mason. She agrees to give them one after they got her peanuts through a series of additional tasks.\n\n===Darla===\nDarla (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in a Western accent) is a very tough, unfriendly, aggressive, tomboyish, determined but also kind-hearted, sweet and caring [[Guinea baboon]]. She appears mainly as a background zoo animal. She was first mentioned in \"Assault and Batteries\", but made her first appearance in \"Out of the Groove\". In this episode, she stole Julien's groove after he [[skunk]]-bombed her. After several attempts by the Penguins to get the groove back, she finally gives it back when Skipper manages to make Julien apologize.\n\nShe had her second major role in \"Hair Apparent\". In this episode, she began pampering Maurice (thinking he was a male baboon after he got most of his tail fur ripped off, got red paint on his bottom, and got Commissioner McSlade's toupee stuck on his head making Julien jealous. The penguins later take the wig from Maurice to return it, making Darla angry to find out Maurice is a lemur. By the end of the episode, she decides to pamper Mort instead.\n\n====Carol and Jillian====\nCarol and Jillian (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) are Darla's baboon friends who are often seen with her.\n\n===Shelly===\nShelly (voiced by [[Melissa McCarthy]]) is an [[ostrich]] who lives in the Central Park Zoo. For most of the series, she only appears as a background zoo animal.\n\nHer first major role and her first speaking role so far is in the episode \"Love Takes Flightless\". In this episode she falls for Rico after he saves her from being frozen in cement by demolishing it. She tries to get Rico's attention by hiding his doll in the dumpster. After seeing how upset Rico was about it, she helps the penguins get it back from the garbage truck. At the end, Shelly gets herself a muscular male doll and becomes happy with it.\n\n===Becky and Stacy===\nBecky and Stacy (voiced by [[Jennette McCurdy]] and [[Victoria Justice]]) are two [[American badger]]s that are residents of the zoo. It hasn't been revealed if they are either friends or sisters. They are prone to having to put up with badger stereotypes.\n\nPrivate was initially fearful of badgers, but Becky and Stacy won his heart by giving him Peanut Butter Winkies. After Private left, Becky and Stacy started badgering Marlene into doing wild and crazy things with them. Marlene, annoyed, tells them to stop badgering her. They ended up attacking Marlene due to the use of badger stereotypes. They were eventually defeated when Marlene fell outside the park and went into her wild state. After that incident, Becky and Stacy appear to respect and fear Marlene since they all have a picnic with the penguins in the park with the two of them being held in between wild Marlene's arms.\n\nBecky and Stacy both make a reappearance in \"Tunnel of Love,\" where they fall in love with the beavers and romance interferes with the beavers' work.\n\n===Randy===\nRandy (voiced by [[Will Friedle]]) is a [[sheep]] who lives at the Children's Zoo at the Central Park Zoo. Children are constantly coming to pet him. Many of them have sticky hands due to eating too much candy.\n\nIn his debut episode \"Can't Touch This,\" one kid in particular hits him and rips his fur until finally Randy cannot stand the torture any longer resulting in Randy biting the kid. The kid screams, causing Alice to come and see what the problem is. The penguins hear the boy's cry as well. When they get there and see the child lie to Alice. Alice apologizes, and puts Randy in a cage. Skipper then says they're going to teach the sheep a lesson for biting a child. Once Randy tells them their story, the Penguins decide to help Randy with his predicament by using various defense methods including: \"Repelling\" Polymer, Static Electricity, and Hypnosis, all of which backfire. Eventually, Randy ends up back in the Petting Zoo, but as a consultation, Skipper and Rico teach him some self-defense combat techniques to prevent anymore accidents.\n\nRandy appears again in \"Operation: Neighbor Swap\" where he welcomes the Lemurs into the petting zoo but once Julien gets comfortable, he too grows tired and annoyed of his constant bossing. He helps the penguins formulate a plan to get Julien back to his old habitat.\n\n===Muffy, Buffy, and Fluffy===\nMuffy, Buffy and Fluffy (all three voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]) are three adorable, cute, and cuddly [[rabbit]]s who reside in the Central Park Children's Zoo. As shown in the show they appear to be cute and innocent but they happen to be very good fighters (evident by how they managed to beat up the penguins with ease).\n\nThey made their first appearance in \"Operation: Neighbor Swap,\" when the Lemurs were transferred to the Petting Zoo. When they met the lemurs, they became loyal to King Julien because they heard he was a king (and because of his \"magnificent\" tail).\n\n===Clemson===\nClemson (voiced by [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]) is a very descriptive and exuberant [[bamboo lemur]] who made his first appearance in the episode \"Right Hand Man.\". After being transferred to the Central Park Zoo, Clemson tried to replace Maurice as Julien's right hand man by constantly pampering him. Mort (who had suspected Clemson was evil since he arrived) found out that Clemson was planning to ship Julien to the Hoboken Zoo so that he could take over as king. The Penguins later turn the tables on him by pushing Clemson into the crate to be sent off.\n\nClemson appeared again in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" where he helped the Penguins fight off the android animals of the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nClemson's returns in \"King Me\" where he informs the lemurs that Julien can't inherite the crown and nearly wins a contest to see who would be king. He was thwarted when the Penguins switched Clemson's brain with Julien's. Julien in Clemson's body then decrees \"Julien\" king right before they are switched back. Clemson is then chased back to Hoboken by Bada and Bing after Julien insulted them while still in Clemson's body.\n\n===Lulu===\nLulu (voiced by [[Jane Leeves]]) is a female [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]. She first appears in \"Monkey Love\", in which she was staying at the Central Park Zoo while her habitat in the Hoboken Zoo was being repaired. Once she showed up, Phil fell in love with her. When Mason tries to set the two up, she thinks Mason is asking her out. After several failed attempts by the penguins and King Julien to show off Phil's skills, Phil explains the whole situation to her in American Sign Language and she agrees to go out with him before she has to leave.\n\nShe appears again in \"The Hoboken Surprise\", along with Hans, Savio, Clemson and Rhonda, where she helps the penguins fight off the android animals of the Hoboken Zoo.\n\n===Doris===\nDoris (voiced by [[Calista Flockhart]]) is a dolphin. Kowalski has a crush on her who is spoken of in several episodes. As shown in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep76|Hot Ice]],\" Kowalski sees her as a love interest, though it appears to be unrequited (since Doris wanted someone \"hipper\").\n\nDoris makes her first appearance in \"The Penguin who Loved Me\" and is revealed to be the sister of Dr. Blowhole. She wishes for Kowalski to help her free her brother Francis from captivity along with a [[platypus]] named Parker. After the penguins and Parker follow Doris to Seaville, they get to Francis' exhibit where it is revealed he is none other than Dr. Blowhole, who has forgotten who he really is and thinks he's Flippy because of his memories being wiped out and is now happily performing tricks for people. Parker than betrays the Penguins and Doris when he reveals he works for Dr. Blowhole and takes him back to the base where all the Lobsters are. As they try to restore his memories, Doris and The Penguins storm in and the aforementioned characters get in a fight. Soon enough Doris accidentally finds Blowhole's Mind Jacker and Parker uses it to restore his memories. Blowhole then captures the Penguins and Doris, and reveals his evil plan is to fire his new weapon \"Project Bad Tidings\" at the moon, flood the entire world and rule it. But after Kowalski tricks him and they foil his plan and manage to escape before the base explodes. As soon as they get back home, Doris tells Kolwaski that she likes him now and they kiss for the first time.\n\n===Savio===\nSavio (voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]) is a large [[green anaconda]] (often simply referred to as a [[boa constrictor]]) that has attacked the animals on three occasions. When he was initially transferred to the zoo in \"The Big Squeeze\", the penguins suspected him of being the cause of the disappearance of the lemurs and Marlene, but his cage appeared inescapable; the only means of departure was a vent that Savio could have used when unfed but would have been unable to access when returning. Skipper realises that he was instead using the vent to access the keypad that controlled his cage locks with his tail, allowing him to open his cage. He was defeated on this occasion when the penguins lured him into Burt's habitat, with Burt throwing Savio around and squeezing him through the bars to expel his previously-eaten victims. Alice later had Savio transferred to the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nSavio returned as an enemy in \"All Tied Up With a Boa\", intending to eat the penguins, the lemurs, and Marlene in revenge for their previous defeat- subsequently intending to regurgitate them and eat them in reverse order to his previous consumption- after immobilising Burt by sending a mouse to the zoo to trick him into running into a wall in panic, but Julien managed to escape by hiding in the popcorn machine and becoming covered in butter, his slippery form resulting in Savio becoming tied up in knots, covered in butter, and sent back to Hoboken.\n\nSavio appeared as an ally in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" where he assisted the penguins in defeating the android animals of the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nSavio returns again in \"The Terror of Madagascar\" when Julien has him transferred back to the zoo as he had hired him to eat a baby fossa that he believes is trying to eat him, but the fossa is revealed to see Julien as a father figure and defeats Savio by biting him and chases him back to Hoboken (While annoying Skipper at the idea that the penguins have now not defeated Savio three times & yells in frustration seeing Savio defeated by the fossa instead of them).\n\n===The Vesuvius Twins===\nThe Vesuvius Twins (voiced by [[Atticus Shaffer]]) are two schoolboys from a very wealthy family. They are disliked by all of the animals of the zoo because of how nasty they are. Even though they are repeatedly banned from going near the animals, they usually get around the ban because of their parent's wealth, e.g. purchasing all of the tickets for an event at the zoo. Private often encourages others to show kindness to the boys, choosing to believe that they are secretly good.\n\n===Cecil and Brick===\nCecil and Brick (voiced by [[French Stewart]] and [[John DiMaggio]]) are two criminals that have occasionally run afoul of the Penguins.\n\n===Archie===\nArchie (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is a [[raccoon]] with a [[Robin Hood]]-like motive and a friend of Fred. He first appears in \"Mask of the Raccoon\" where he has been going around stealing from the zoo and supposedly giving to the poor. His plot was exposed by the Penguins upon learning about him from Fred and ends up having to give to the poor.\n\nIn \"The Big Move,\" Archie appears as a property agent where he tries to sell Rico a house. In this appearance, he is not in his Robin Hood costume and not using a French accent.\n\n===Amarillo Kid===\nThe Amarillo Kid (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[nine-banded armadillo]].\n\nA long time ago, the Amarillo Kid challenged Private to a game of mini golf, back when Private was one of the best mini golf players and was known as Mr. Tux. Private quit after the game, which ended in a tie, because he had to hit a little possum girl's ice cream cone (it was a double scoop) to tie it up. Though Private admitted that the pressure made him quit after all. Several years later in \"Mr. Tux,\" he arrived at the Central Park Zoo to challenge Private to a game to prove he's the best. At first, Private refuses to fight him. Enraged by this, the Kid locked down the entire zoo and threatened to blow it up with a thermonuclear reactor. Private battles him, and though the game is close, Private wins with the help of a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] he had saved early. Ashamed, the Amarillo Kid leaves.\n\nThe Amarillo Kid later returns in \"Showdown on Fairway 18,\" but this time has a changed personality. This time, he comes to the Penguins for help when he has lost a mini-golf match against the Gopher Brothers Bo and Gomer and they want his shell (which the Amarillo Kid used in a wager). The Amarillo Kid tells him of the Westchester Putter from Yabogeyhaha, a golden golf putting club which grants its wielder unbeatable power so that even the worst will become the greatest, and he desires to use it in a rematch against the Gophers to save himself. Private and the Amarillo Kid find the Westchester Putter. Through a series of comical foul-ups, they finally claim the Putter. Private hands the Westchester Putter over to the Amarillo Kid on the agreement that he will return it as soon as he has won his rematch. Touched by Private's kindness, the Amarillo Kid confesses his intentions to steal the Putter for the Gophers in order to save his shell as Private's emotions egged him & made him feel guilt for what he was preparing to do. He decides to turn over a new leaf, and voluntarily puts the Putter back, saying he'd rather go shell-less than proving Skipper & Private right that he hadn't changed. Just then, the other penguins and the Gophers show up. The Gophers trap the penguins under a chandelier, take the Westchester Putter for themselves, and escape the building, proving that the Amarillo Kid had been telling the truth and they had tricked Skipper and his team into helping them as Kowalski recapped the gophers' clever ingenuity of their plan. As they make their getaway, the Amarillo Kid stays to free the penguins. The penguins and the Amarillo Kid pursue the Gophers in a mini golf cart chase. Just as it seems the Gophers are going to give the penguins the slip, the Amarillo Kid uses his golfing skills to sabotage their cart and save the Putter. With the Gophers successfully thwarted, the Amarillo Kid thanks Private for believing in him, and they part on good terms... that is, only after Private reminds the Amarillo Kid remembers he is supposed to give the Westchester Putter back.\n\n===Miss Perky===\nMiss Perky (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is Rico's [[doll]] girlfriend.\n\n===Granny Squirrel===\nGranny [[Squirrel]] (voiced by [[Debbie Reynolds]]) first appeared as a granny of Fred in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel,\" but then the gang believed she is a ghost.\n\n===Barry===\nBarry (voiced by [[Kevin McDonald]]) is a [[strawberry poison-dart frog]] who first appears in the episode \"Untouchable\" where he is a transfer from the Hoboken Zoo and begins terrorizing the animals by temporarily poisoning Skipper, Kowalski and Rico. Private manages to stop him by putting on a steel suit and hugging him, making Barry realize he only needed a friend.\n\nHe appears mainly as a background zoo animal in more recent episodes.\n\n===Frankie===\nFrankie (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[homing pigeon]] who first appeared on \"Launchtime.\"\n\n===The Red Squirrel===\nThe [[American red squirrel|Red Squirrel]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is an evil red squirrel who appears in the episodes \"The Red Squirrel,\" \"A Visit From Uncle Nigel,\" \"Our Man in Grrfurjiclestan,\" and \"Nuts to You.\"\n\n===The Broches===\nThe Broches are the trio of [[American cockroach|cockroaches]] who appears in the episode \"Stop Bugging Me.\"\n\n====Mike====\nMike (voiced by [[Zand Broumand]]) is a member of the Broches.\n\n====Duane====\nDuane (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]]) is a member of the Broches.\n\n====Eddie====\nEddie (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]]) is a member of the Broches.\n\n===Frances Alberta===\nFrances Alberta (voiced by [[Megan Hilty]]) is the presumptive head [[zookeeper]] at the Hoboken Zoo who appeared in the episode \"The Hoboken Surprise.\" Frances was first shown to be a cheerful zookeeper who had worked to clean up the zoo's poor conditions, gaining the respect of resident animals Rhonda, Hans, Clemson, Savio, and Lulu. Frances also afforded the animals under her care many amenities, such as fine cuisine, massage chairs, and a fountain of cheese. It is later revealed that Frances never had the respect of her animals, whom she had simply sealed away under the ground and replaced with android look-alikes, all in an effort to meet her demanding standard for cleanliness and to get the attention of Parks Commissioner Pervis McSlade. At the end of the episode, Commissioner McSlade fires her and the Hoboken Police arrests her for making android look-alike animals and assault of a Bartender.\n\n===Kitka===\nKitka (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is a female [[peregrine falcon]] whom Skipper falls in love with. She only appears in \"The Falcon and the Snow Job\".\n\n===Nurse Shawna W. Smith===\nShawna W. Smith (voiced by [[Joanna Garcia]]) is a zoo nurse who only appears in the episode \"Love Hurts\".\n\n===Special Agent Buck Rockgut===\nSpecial Agent Buck Rockgut (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]) is a [[Northern rockhopper penguin|rockhopper penguin]] who first appears in \"The Red Squirrel\".\n\n===Hunter===\nHunter (voiced by [[Ciara Bravo]]) is a young female [[leopard seal]] who doesn't eat penguins. She only appears in the episode \"Operation: Antarctica\".\n\n===Uncle Nigel===\nUncle Nigel (voiced by [[Peter Capaldi]]) is Private's uncle, who works as a spy for MI6, and comes to New York to visit his nephew and to find The Red Squirrel. His first, and so far only, appearance is in \"A Visit From Uncle Nigel.\"\n\nWhen around the penguins (minus Private), Nigel acted like a \"posh nancycat\". This was all part of his cover story. When captured by The Red Squirrel, Nigel was forced to tell Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico that he actually was a spy.\n\nIt is unknown if Nigel really is Private's uncle in blood or not (due to being a different species of penguin). Though it is possible that he is either an honorary uncle or perhaps one of Private's parents was the same species of penguin Nigel is and he is their brother whilst the other parent was the same species as Private.\n\n===Blue Hen===\nBlue Hen ( voiced by [[Audrey Wasilewski]]) is a [[chicken]] who is first introduced in \"Mental Hen\" as a mute animal with psychic powers. Kowalski, being a sceptic, records her and sends the video on internet, hoping someone will figure out that Blue Hen is faking her powers, only for her to gain popularity.\n\nShe is then revealed to just be extremely intelligent rather than psychic, being able to figure out what's going to happen with analytical thinking. She can also talk and becomes an enemy of penguins after they find out that she was waiting for someone like Kowalski to expose her so that she can gain popularity and power. Unable to defeat her rationally or by fighting, Kowalski sets up a plan to distract her by singing and dancing seductively, leading her to choose the wrong option. While she starts holding a grudge against Kowalski, she compliments his dancing ability and kisses him.\n\nShe returns in P.E.L.T as an antagonist.\n\n===Manfredi and Johnson===\nManfredi and Johnson (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] and [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) are [[penguin]]s who were former members of Skipper's team. They are typically cited for the nature of their demise or a mistake they made as an example of what can happen if one lets their guard down or neglects their training. The exact method of their demise varies in each instance and in some cases are contradictory: killed by an exploding trap, killed by flying piranhas, losing vital internal organs, etc.\n\nThey are finally seen in \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\", in an enclosure in Seaville both with bruises and injuries, but very much alive. However, they have somehow injured their eyes. Manfredi (the larger sized penguin) has lost his left foot now replaced by a stick while Johnson (the Kowalski-sized penguin) broke his right flipper and seems to have a burn on his body. Johnson noticed the penguins and Doris \"flying out\" of Seaville and banged on the glass panel for help. Unfortunately for them, the penguins never noticed their desperate pleas and swam away saying they were never going to come back ever again.\n\nStrangely they do not appear in ''Penguins of Madagascar'', implying that they may have met the four at a much later time.\n\n==Characters in ''All Hail King Julien''==\n\n===Clover===\nClover (voiced by [[India de Beaufort]]) is a green-eyed [[crowned lemur]] who is King Julien's bodyguard. She is smart, cunning, (mostly) mature, but tends to be rather paranoid (comes with the job), is brave to the point of recklessness and can be prone to sudden outbursts of violence, but can also be sweet, friendly and kind-hearted towards her friends. In general, she and Maurice tend to be the voice of reason to keep Julien's crazy ideas in check.\n\nAfter the events of the first episode, Clover becomes his commander. She is the main protector King Julien (since the other guards ran away) Despite the fact that she thinks the new king isn't very bright she is fanatically loyal and faithful to him and is even willing to die for her king. Unlike his uncle, Julien treats her with a lot more respect (for example at the end of episode one he points out that he noticed she was the only one of the guards who didn't run away and because of that his promoting her to commander). Her shocked response to the comment implies that uncle Julien never bothered to even compliment her. A running gag is that she acts like she is talking with someone through a radio earpiece. She didn't believe in having a fun life until she slid down the water slide going after Mort during Uncle King Julien XII's return. In \"Eat Prey Shove\", it is revealed she writes a rather fan fiction-y romantic novel as a hobby. It is also here she meets Sage Moondancer, with whom Clover has a rather complex romantic relationship - while she loves him, his stoic and peaceful nature often irritates her. It takes several seasons for both of them to realize they balance each other out as the perfect weapon.\n\nIn \"Crimson and Clover,\" it is revealed that Clover has a twin sister named Crimson, with whom she has a long lasting rivalry. Despite their antagonistic behaviour, they still consider each other family and Crimson has helped Clover out on occasion.\nIn the storyline of \"Exiled\", Clover went on a quest with Sage to find the perfect weapon, only to realize through the teachings of Sage's annoying mudskipper master that they need each other to be in perfect balance (after spending a day body-swapped). Koto, Sage's evil brother wanted to force Clover to marry him, and she was ready to make this sacrifice for the life of Julien, but in the end she was freed and was essential in defeating Koto and his army.\n\nIn Season 5, when King Julien puts security cameras all over the kingdom, Clover is overjoyed to finally be able to enforce all the long-forgotten ancient laws she never had the chance to. This overzealousness causes everyone in the kingdom to be arrested eventually, with Clover turning herself in too when she got up from the bed on the wrong foot. In episode 12, she expects Sage to propose to her, but finds out he is marrying her sister, Crimson. Trying to suppress her anger, she stays to help the mountain lemur kingdom, and eventually causes Sage to realize she is his soulmate, hurrying after her and proposing to her. This causes some concern for King Julien, as Clover will leave the kingdom after the marriage, so he tries to train the kingdom into an army, leading to disaster when real foosas attack. In the last episode, the wedding eventually proceeds after some hiccups, such as Julien burying Sage and forgetting where he was, and creating a Frankenstein's monster version to stand in for the wedding, while Clover reconciles with Crimson and says her goodbye to Julien. She leaves for the mountain lemur kingdom with Sage at the end of the episode after the wedding, explaining her absence in the Madagascar movies.\n\n===Masikura===\nMasikura (voiced by [[Debra Wilson]]) is a [[psychic]] [[chameleon]] who appears once you call her. She sticks her tongue on your head and analyzes you for predictions or reading thoughts. He told Julien's uncle that the king of the lemurs would be eaten by the Foosa. With that, Uncle King Julien hands over the crown to his nephew and leaves. At the coronation, the Foosa interrupted and take some lemurs with them. Masikura told King Julien, Maurice, and Clover about what happened. King Julien goes to the Foosa territory to save the lemurs, he got bitten on the butt, he shouts and the boulders fall down, scaring the Foosa. Julien was relieved that Masikura was wrong about the Foosa eating him. Masikura appears and say she didn't say the Foosa wouldn't eat all of him completely and points at his butt.\n\nIn \"Poll Position\", King Julien calls Masikura to use her tongue on Xixi's head to find out who's the one hater. Masikura denined, but King Julien grabbed her and starts shooting her tongue at Xixi. Her tongue hits Maurice's head and predicted grape jelly, a funnel, and a pair of woman shoes. Maurice said it was spring break.\n\nIn \"He Blinded Me with Science,\" Masikura played a big role, where she helps King Julien dance for the sky god Kevin to make it rain. When King Julien meets Timo, a [[tenrec]] scientist, he automates everything in the kingdom and they got hooked up on science. Later, King Julien let Masikura go, much to her dismay. She meets Mort in his tree stump and insisted to stay with him. During her stay, Masikura gets creeped out with Mort, saying he \"sleep hugs\" and says that he is a girl. Then, a fire breaks out from the generator, King Julien apologizes to Masikura and he, Maurice, and Clover ask for her help. Masikura believes that if they combined science and the rain that would put out the fire and save the kingdom. Timo makes a makeshift hose and King Julien danced on it to get the water out, thus putting the fire out.\n\n===Maggie the Unwashed===\nMaggie (voiced by [[Andy Richter]]) is a poor replacement of Masikura, her predictions are shams and she constantly suffers from extreme flatulence. Maggie seems not to care about other people's opinion or about anything in general. She is often hired by various villains to be their accessory. Physically, she is identical to Masikura but has a much more pale color and is constantly cross-eyed.\n\n===Prince Barty===\nPrince Barty (voiced by [[John Michael Higgins]]) is a ring-tailed lemur who is the father of King Julien XIII and the husband of Princess Julienne. He always acts in a posh and upper-class manner. Like his wife, he does not care much about his son, or the fate of the kingdom, and they are content to live on a remote island as long as the kingdom sends them their regular mango supply. Whenever they visit King Julien, they always live in extreme luxury, serviced by a horde of servants. Often they have \"parties\" for their relatives (in actuality the relatives are killed by sharks).\n\n===Princess Julienne===\nPrincess Julienne (voiced by [[Anjelica Huston]]) is a ring-tailed lemur who is the mother King Julien XIII and the wife of Prince Barty. She is also the sister of Uncle King Julien. Like her husband, she does not care about her son at all, only that her constant supply of mango is provided on time, so she only shows up whenever there is any emergency in the kingdom that would threaten their income used to support their extravagant lifestyle. King Julien desperately wants their parents approval and love at first, even going as far as to hire Karl to kidnap them - however this turns into a real life-or-death situation due to Karl's betrayal. After his parents actually start to care about him, Julien gets annoyed by their constant doting and eventually gets them to leave.\n\n===King Julien XII===\nKing Julien XII (voiced by [[Henry Winkler]]) is a ring-tailed lemur who is the uncle of King Julien XIII. As Julien XIII's predecessor, Julien XII is a lazy, strict, paunchy, cowardly, and older lemur oozing smarminess where he had strict rules that kept the lemur kingdom quiet in order to keep the Fossa away. In the first episode, he gives the crown to his nephew and leaves when he learns from Masikura that the king of the lemurs will be eaten by the Foosa. When King Julien saves the captured lemurs, he got bitten on the butt and is still alive. When King Julien XIII thrives as king, his devious uncle will do any conniving thing to regain the throne.\n\nUncle King Julien returned in the fifth episode, not happy that his nephew is still alive and set to reclaim the throne from him. When King Julien was sliding down the water slide, his uncle turns off the water, leaving his rear end on fire. King Julien then sees his uncle and has a hard time remembering him, much to his annoyance. Maurice helped Julien remember by placing his crown on his uncle's head. He made up a story and tricked his nephew that he heard the Fossa were planning an attack and Julien volunteers to go to their territory and find out with Maurice in a Fossa disguise. During his absence, Uncle King Julien made changes to his throne room. Mort goes up to the throne room and sees Julien's uncle. Uncle Julien takes a seriously hatred of Mort. Mort says that Julien, (the other Julien), is the one and only king and is \"a billion times better than him\", which makes him mad. Uncle Julien orders Clover to destroy Mort, but Mort says he'd rather be destroyed by \"his King Julien\" and runs off crying. After seeing the changes his nephew made, he orders Clover to close down everything Julien put up. When Clover closed everything down, she chased Mort down the water slide when he was violating the rule against it and she actually enjoyed it. Clover tells Julien's uncle what happened and says the kingdom is happy for the first time in a long time and vows to help improve when Julien comes back. When Julien's uncle says that Julien is not coming back, Clover, discovering Julien's uncle's plot, angrily forces Uncle Julien to say it again and drags him to the Foosa territory. They see Julien and Maurice in the Fossa suit surrounded by the Fossa. Uncle Julien is unhappy that Clover wants his nephew as king. Before Uncle Julien can hit Clover, she hits Uncle Julien and uses him as bait to attract the Foosa and saves Julien and Maurice, while fighting the Fossa via suit. Julien knows his uncle's plot to reclaim the throne and is glad that Clover chose him, even though she didn't think the kingdom should be fun 24/7 but knows living in fear is worst. While taunting the Fossa with Uncle King Julien still as bait, Maurice wondered about what will they do with him, as he is not to be trusted. Julien says that his uncle is still family and \"family always deserves a second chance.\" He suggests that they should give his uncle \"a chance at a new life.\" The episode ends with Uncle Julien in the Foosa suit that is being cuddled by a Fossa girl much to his dismay. In a later episode he creates his own kingdom, Feartopia, tricks his nephew into giving him all his subjects, and imprisons them there as \"citizens\"; he is later imprisoned alone inside his own little dystopia. In season 5, he decided to give up his throne for Zora and flee with her for his joyfulness in which his nephew gave his excuses.\n\nAccording to Masikura in \"Viva Mort,\" Julien's uncle is the worst king because he did some things to other kingdoms and never apologized. Masikura told King Julien he doesn't have to be his uncle, when she is trying to help him apologize to Maurice.\n\nIn a later plot, Uncle King Julien lures the whole kingdom to another island by faking the end of the world, only to imprison them in a camp and locking his nephew in the \"Iron Booty\". In the end, Julien frees everyone, and instead locks his uncle inside the camp.\n\nUncle King Julien returns to participate in the Jungle Olympics, enlisting Crimson and Sage on his team, trying to win the games - and the crown.\n\nIn Exiled, he is revealed to be running gladiatorial games and training foosa with Mary Ann. King Julien and Maurice go undercover in their bad foosa disguise, but Uncle King Julien easily sees through it, and tries to kill them. He joins their effort to save the kingdom when he learns it has been taken over by Koto, though.\n\nIn the Season 5 episode \"Night Creatures\", he visits alongside his sister, King Julien's mother, to investigate the strange beast hauntings in the kingdom, hoping that he can get the crown back if King Julien is declared incompetent to rule. It is revealed though that he himself engineered the beast attacks by feeding gecko milk to King Julien, which causes an allergic transformation in the Julien bloodline. Captured in a cage, he is fed milk and forced to transform himself.\n\nHe returns in a later episode, where he engineers a plot to cause King Julien to depopulate the kingdom due to the increased arrests thanks to the security cameras he supplied Julien with. However, while watching the events unfold on the cameras, he is smitten by Zora, and starts sending love letters to her. Eventually Maurice locates him in a cave, and King Julien confronts him after he stole the crown, but he admits he no longer wants it, only to live happily with Zora. After Julien introduces him to her, the two are instantly smitten, and they leave, Uncle King Julien promising not to try and kill his nephew anymore.\n\nThe two show up again in the last episode, attending Clover and Sage's wedding.\n\n===Ted===\nTed (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]] in ''Madagascar'', [[Andy Richter]] in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a [[Golden bamboo lemur]] with a slight accent. Throughout all the series, Ted is shown to be nervous at many times. He says silly things like \"Flipper-doodles\" or \"Maraschino cherries.\" Ted also has a tendency to joy- or fear-tinkle a lot, something he feels the need to exclaim loudly. He has a wife named Dorothy. Their marriage is revealed in the episode \"Diapers are the New Black\". Dorothy is more interested in the marriage than Ted, considering that he cried at their honeymoon. In the episode \"That Sinking Feeling\", when everyone thought the island was sinking, Dorothy tackled Hector just because he threw Ted way behind him. Ted makes appearances in most episodes, and played large roles in \"Eat Prey Shove,\" and, \"Diapers are the New Black.\" He was named as Clover's assistant captain of the Ringtail guard, but due to his cowardly nature (and because Clover is always around) he rarely if ever gets to do anything in this position. In \"Poll Position\" when people disliked King Julien, Ted would eat the kumquats off the pole, decreasing the popularity of people liking King Julien. He states it was his dream job and it has become a nightmare, when he ate too many kumquats because more people no longer like him. Maurice asks Julien why he has to eat the kumquats, and Julien answered it's the \"only thing that brings him joy.\"In \"Eat Prey Shove,\" Ted once covered for Clover when she was sent on a vacation with Mort and Xixi and unknowingly caused the Fossa to take advantage of Clover's vacation to attack King Julien's kingdom.\n\nIn Exiled, Ted stows away on the submarine with King Julien, Maurice and Pancho when they escape the kingdom after Koto's takeover. On the island inhabited by sultry lady lemurs, Ted is the only one (due to his devotion to Dorothy) who does not succumb to their seduction, and consequently, eludes capture. The stress of being alone and hunted causes a split personality to take over Ted, who rescues Maurice and King Julien from the Tentacle. Calling himself Snake, this version of him wears an eyepatch, vest, and has a handlebar moustache. Snake is an extremely competent and fearless fighter, who acts like a 1990s action movie star and often says his name out loud for no reason.\n\nIn season 5, being bored with Ted's indecisive nature, Dorothy convinces Ted to bring Snake out once again with Dr S' experimental methods. However, she soon finds Snake to be boring due to his one-track mind and lack of curiosity. While shutting down Timo's water pump, Snake is shocked back to Ted, and Dorothy apologizes to him, saying he is the lemur she married and loves, not Snake. Later, when cameras being placed everywhere in the kingdom lead to an increased number of arrests, Clover deputizes Ted to be the prison's warden, a job he performs with great delight. In the end, only he ends up being the only not imprisoned lemur in the kingdom after Clover arrests herself.\n\n===Willie===\nWillie (voiced by [[Cody Cameron]] in ''Madagascar'', [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a lemur who first appears in the first episode as one of the captured lemurs. King Julien saves them from the Foosa. Willie has a tendency to see the worst in everything, and his catchphrase is screaming \"We are all gonna die!\" whenever there is any crisis at hand. Consequently, King Julien tends to blame Willie for things he is not even responsible for. He goes so far as to often mention him by name whenever he has to make a public appearance to note whatever is troubling the country at the moment, adding \"...and also, Willie\" and eliciting an enraged \"What the heck, man?\" from him.\n\nWillie was briefly seen in the first film when he was called out during King Julien's meeting about what to do with Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria. He states that he likes them. It is noticeable that he has a different voice and design compared to his appearance in \"All Hail King Julien.\"\n\n===Xixi===\nXixi (voiced by [[Betsy Sodaro]]) is a very trustworthy [[toucan]] in news who informs the lemur kingdom on current events. According to King Julien, Xixi also a very trustworthy Toucan in friendship. She covered King Julien's coronation party but fled when the party was raided by the Foosa in the first episode.\n\nShe appears again in \"Poll Position\" in which she reports that 99% of the kingdom thinks the new king (Julien) is doing a good job. This report sets both episode plots in motion namely King Julien attempting to locate and turn the hater while also allowing Clover to launch an investigation to find the hater and make sure he isn't trying to recruit more lemurs to his side to cause an uprising.\n\nShe makes another appearance in \"Eat Pray Shove\", when she happily accepts to go on a vacation with Clover and Mort. Xixi and Mort enjoy relaxing on the beach, while Clover doesn't. Xixi and Mort have a fun time while Clover went off and meet a handsome and muscular lemur.\n\n===Hector===\nHector (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is an incredibly moody lemur. According to Maurice, Hector hates everybody and everything. He is also a bit odd. For example, when Clover asked if he didn't want to see King Julien to help him solve his problems, he replies to her that he likes his problems. According to Xixi, he has a very large family. Despite his bitterness, he does admit that King Julien is doing a better job than the previous kings. Hector also adds that he thinks that it is not a great accomplishment as he thinks the previous kings were much more incompetent than Julien was. In the episode \"Poll Position\", Hector was basically the only one who did not love Julien. After Julien knocked down Hector's masterpiece, his support went down by unhappiness of Hector's big family.\nIn another appearance, Hector joined Abner and Becca in using catapults to \"relocate\" everyone from the kingdom whom they did not like, this soon caused the kingdom to lose most of its populace.\n\nIn Season 5, he is revealed to be the Minister in charge of Mangoes, a post he fulfilled for a long time successfully protecting his charge from the fruit flies by a flyswatter he is really attached to. In the election battles between Maurice and Mort he is forced to abandon his post, leading to a crisis with the flies abducting everyone, but at the end he is restored to it again.\n\nDespite his grumpiness, Hector has a strong sense of logic and is often the only character to see how ridiculous a situation is. His catchphrase is declaring \"Bunch of ding-dongs\" whenever people do something stupid.\n\n===Horst===\nHorst (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[blue-eyed black lemur]]. As said by Clover in the episode My Fair Foosa, not much is known about him. Kind of a loner, fears change, and is always seen holding a beverage in a coconut shell. It was also revealed in the same episode that he was married to the fossa named Mary Ann but she mauled him twice because of his snoring. It is revealed in 'King Julien Superstar' that he is also known as DJ Glitter-Bunz.<ref>Watching All Hail King Julien</ref> He usually interrupts whatever he is saying by taking a long sip from his beverage through a straw before finishing the sentence, annoying others.\n\nIn Exiled, he and Mary Ann reconcile and get back together once again.\n\nIn Season 5, he is shown to be having a picnic with Mary Ann, still loving her despite her hard to suppress urges to eat him. When the other foosa rebel and tie the two to a tree, Horst reveals that due to the many scarring he received while romancing Mary Ann, he can contort and mangle his body to escape his bonds, impressing Mary Ann, who declares her love for him before leaving to restore order amongst the foosa.\n\n===Dorothy===\nDorothy (voiced by [[Sarah Thyre]]) is a [[mongoose lemur]] who is the wife of Ted. She appears to be at about the same intelligence level of her husband. Dorothy is sweet, caring, and possibly good at cooking. She is a minor character throughout all the series. In the episode \"Diapers are the New Black\", Dorothy and Ted start creating fraud diapers to make a profit. This leads to Julien getting upset that another brand is stealing customers, so he and Ted get in a competition of diaper-making. Dorothy and Ted's relationship starts getting better and better in the fourth series. Their marriage is revealed in the third series.\n\nIn season 5, Dorothy is bored with Ted's indecisive nature and ask Dr S' help to bring out Ted's more manly alter-ego, Snake. However, Snake is revealed to be rather simple-minded and crude, and at the end Dorothy is happy to get her husband back.\n\n===Pancho===\nPancho (voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) is a [[crowned lemur]]. He is mentioned in \"Poll Position\" when Xixi mentions him in her report stating that he is looking cozy for he's canoodling with a new lemur lady and questions if love is in the air. King Julien agrees that he hopes so and states that \"Pancho needs it.\"\nIn Season 4, it is revealed in 'The Panchurian Candidate' that Uncle King Julien uses mind-washing to condition Pancho as the perfect assassin, for the scenario if he is ever deposed. Unaware of this, Pancho is activated when he hears the trigger word, to kill King Julien. Thanks to Clover and Maurice, the assassination is averted, but Pancho remains ill at ease and paranoid after this experience.\nIn Exiled, when King Julien and Maurice have to flee the kingdom, they escape in a nuclear submarine piloted by Pancho, who was preparing for this scenario due to his paranoia. Later, he sabotages the blimp of the Russian chimps at King Julien's orders, and is thrown out of the blimp as a result. He is revealed to have survived though.\nPancho is known as a felon (which according to him is written with a \"ph\") to other lemurs, who keep their distance from him.\nIn Season 5, Pancho's skills with explosives are often used when destruction is needed, though he often tends to go overboard with violent solutions to problems.\n\n===Sage Moondancer===\nSage Moondancer (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a buff and spiritualistic [[Indri|lemur]]. He tends to speak in spiritualist, hippie-like sentences nobody seems to understand. Despite his great strength and fighting skills, he is a devoted pacifist. He and Clover have a complicated romantic relationship - he is drawn to her but often feels threatened by her aggressiveness. Sage has made lifelong a bond with a great eagle, who comes to his aid or to carry him off when it's needed; he can call him via squawking at any time.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Exiled\" that Sage is from the warlike kingdom of the Mountain Lemurs - he left because he disagrees with their conquering, oppressing ways and chose spiritual peace. Unfortunately, in his absence, his evil brother Koto took over the kingdom and conquered King Julien's lemurs and all neighboring kingdoms. Sage goes on a quest with Clover to get help, asking for assistance from his mentor, an enigmatic but seemingly crazy mudskipper named Jarsh-Jarsh. In the end, Sage and Clover bond as they realize after a body-swapped experience that they are the perfect weapon, able to balance each other out. Sage defeats Koto in combat, but at Clover's request spares his life (though he is squashed under his own statue anyway when he tries to backstab Sage).\n\nIn season 5, Sage has to leave King Julien's kingdom to lead his people as their new king, relocating them back to their ancient kingdom. In episode 12, he engages to Crimson, but ends up realizing that Clover is the life-long mate he was always searching for. In episode 13, Sage asks King Julien to bury him during his bachelor party so he can meditate. As the king forgets to mark the spot, they cannot locate Sage the next day, leading to a fake Sage being made by Dr. S., but the real Sage arrives at the wedding eventually and marries Clover.\n\n===Tammy===\nTammy (voiced by [[Debra Wilson]]) is a [[common brown lemur]] who is the mother of Todd and the wife of Butterfish. While she loves her son, she tends to pressure him. She is domineering and in every competition tries to push Todd into the foreground, even cheating if it is necessary. Unlike most lemurs, she does not respect King Julien at all.\n\n===Butterfish===\nButterfish (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a lemur who is the husband of Tammy and the father of Todd.\n\n===Todd===\nTodd (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a [[common brown lemur]] who is the son of Tammy and Butterfish. He is a child prodigy according to his mother, but being forced to perform in every competition seems to have taken a toll on him. Todd is often nervous and has a tic, and when he snaps he can be a terrifying force which can even frighten Mountain lemurs. He and Mort are often rivals because of their similar size, and because his mother often tries to make Todd replace Mort.\n\n===Timo===\nTimo (voiced by Chris Miller in ''Madagascar'', [[David Krumholtz]] in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a [[tenrec]] [[scientist]] who is an expert on technology.\n\nKing Julien first encountered Timo in \"He Blinded Me with Science\" where he replaced the batteries in King Julien's boom box after it ran out of power during King Julien's dance to get the Sky God Kevin to bring rain to his kingdom. Upon introducing Timo to the lemurs, King Julien had them receive the technology that was salvaged from Timo's area. The lemurs get hooked on the technology until a power surge happened that destroyed Timo's generator and started a fire. With help from Masikura, King Julien, Maurice, Mort, Clover, and Timo were able to find ground water to help stop the fire.\nIn \"Viva Mort\", Timo invented a device that would help King Julien to make him embarrassed as a way to make it up to Maurice. Due to the device not being plugged in, Maurice was put through the device and embarrassed instead.\nIn \"The Really Really Big Lie,\" King Julien asks Timo to build a giant mechanical gecko to make it believable to cover his lie. The robot gecko went on a rampage, leaving the kingdom in a panic. Timo says that the off switch is on the bunny ears because Todd loves bunnies. King Julien, Maurice, and Clover managed to shut down the mechanical gecko and escaped from a fall.\n\nIn \"One More Cup,\" King Julien, Maurice, and Mort find a bag of coffee beans and take it to Timo, who made a coffee machine. King Julien drinks the coffee and feels the energy. King Julien and Timo sells the coffee to the lemurs that Julien calls \"Brown Julien\".\n\nIn King Julien Superstar, Timo helped King Julien and the gang become famous superstars by \"tuning\" their voices to sound good.<ref>Watching All Hail King Jullien</ref>\n\nIn Exiled, Timo is absent during the takeover of the country by Koto's army, because he is trapped in his home by the domineering Mom-Bot he has built. Extremely possessive of her \"son\", Mom-Bot constantly berates Timo and wants to control all aspects of his life - it is only with Mort's help that he is able to shut her down and reprogram her. Afterwards, Timo helps Mort bring out Smart Mort, and builds a gate to Morticus Khan's dimension as per his plans.\n\nIn Season 5, Timo builds pipes to dump all the sewage into the watering hole as per King Julien's orders - which he then blames him for, leading Clover to arrest him. Later, he builds a pump to funnel the sewage underground, with disastrous results.\n\n===Mom-Bot===\nBuilt by Timo, Mom-Bot (voiced by [[David Krumholtz]]) is a domineering mother figure robot who somewhat resembles an owl, and speaks with a Jewish accent and always offers to bake traditional Jewish cookies to people. She is also armed to the teeth with lasers, rockets and built-in weaponry. Timo built him to be a supporting mother figure to himself, but her programming was glitchy and she basically imprisoned Timo, doting on him constantly, belittling his achievements, and berating him for not having a girlfriend or having a good job. When Mort visits, he is also captured and forced to stay, but they eventually manage to disable Mom-Bot and Timo reprograms her to be less manic - though she still tends to be doting. She helps the two build the portal to Morticus Khan's dimension, where the Khan attacks and dismembers Mom-Bot, reducing her to a head. \nIn Season 5, Mom-Bot is still just a head, though Timo carries her around when she has to go somewhere.\n\n===King Joey===\nKing Joey (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) is a [[Malagasy giant rat|jumping rat]] who is the ruler of Madagascar's jumping rats. Like his kind, King Joey is not very bright.\n\n===Clumsy Pete===\nClumsy Pete appeared once, in the episode \"The Jungle Games\". During spear throwing, he failed miserably, causing Xixi to state that King Joey should have put in Efficient Charlie. During harpoon shooting, Clover and Crimson get in a fight, causing them to get eliminated and give the round to Clumsy Pete and the rats by default. But while Clumsy Pete mumbled about which button it is to shoot, he hit his own leg. He was out for the Jungle Games and was never seen or mentioned again.\n\n===Efficient Charlie===\nEfficient Charlie, unlike the rest of is kingdom, was surprisingly bright. He was said to always get jobs done. In the episode \"True Bromance\", when Maurice left the lemur kingdom because he was mad at King Julien, he says that he wished Julien would disappear. Since King Joey was not bright, he thought that Maurice wanted Julien killed. Joey put Lazy Dougie on the job, but Efficient Charlie was put in after Dougie overslept. Charlie was seen preparing to throw Julien off a cliff when Maurice arrived and rescued him. Efficient Charlie was not seen again, but he was mentioned in the episode 'The Jungle Games' when Xixi said that Charlie should have been in during spear throwing instead of Clumsy Pete.\n\n===Lazy Dougie===\nLazy Dougie was a member of the rat kingdom. He was shown to be very lazy. He only appears once in the episode \"True Bromance\". He was supposed to have murdered King Julien, but he instead put Efficient Charlie on the job due to him oversleeping. Dougie was not seen or mentioned ever again.\n\n===Becca===\nBecca (voiced by [[Sarah Thyre]] in a Southern accent) is a red/orange-eyed [[black lemur]] who is Abner's wife. Becca and Abner encountered King Julien in his alias of \"Banana Guy Mike\" where he had helped them fix their watering hole. She and her husband vowed to get King Julien off his throne to avenge the \"death\" of Banana Guy Mike. They remain strong opposers of King Julien and consider themselves a resistance movement, albeit they are very inept and know not much about the democracy they fight for.\nIn \"Viva Mort,\" Becca and Abner have started the Lemur Alliance Liberation Army (LALA) to get revenge on King Julien. They duped Mort into helping them until their movement was discovered by Clover. Though Becca and Abner are thwarted, Clover had to leave to keep King Julien from getting stung by a scorpion that was placed in a package that they had Mort give to him.\nIn a later episode, they and Hector decide to rid the kingdom of all \"unwanted elements\", via catapulting them outside the walls they built. This eventually leads to only them staying in the kingdom.\n\n===Abner===\nAbner (voiced by [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in ''Madagascar'', [[Diedrich Bader]] in a Southern accent in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a blue-eyed lemur who is Becca's husband and is not very bright. Abner and Becca encountered King Julien in his alias of \"Banana Guy Mike\" where he had helped them with their powers. He and his wife vowed to get King Julien off his throne to avenge the \"death\" of Banana Guy Mike.\n\nIn Madagascar, he is only seen in the paradise scene, serving drinks and later watching Alex do his performance. In \"Viva Mort,\" Abner and Becca have started the Lemur Alliance Liberation Army (LALA) to get revenge on King Julien. They duped Mort into helping them until their movement was discovered by Clover. Though Abner and Becca are thwarted, Clover had to leave to keep King Julien from getting stung by a scorpion that was placed in a package that they had Mort give to him.\n\n===Karl===\nKarl (voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]) is a devious [[Malagasy civet|fanaloka]]. He is a card-carrying villain (literally) who took it upon himself to become the arch-nemesis of King Julien. Known for his theatrics and love of over-complicated plans, Karl is the kind of villain who rather \"arches\" his nemesis than to actually kill him. It is revealed eventually that he blames Julien for the way he treated him in high school. He is always encountered with his pet hissing cockroach, Chauncey, who is actually his one true friend and companion as well. He tends to make dramatic getaways when thwarted, announcing \"This is not over - not yet, at least.\"\n\nAfter he did some attempts on King Julien's life where Mort took a blow to every attempt, Karl makes himself known to King Julien and invites him to his lair with the directs on the brochure. After Clover and Maurice are captured, King Julien makes his way to Karl's lair at a crashed zeppelin where Karl mentions his plans to raise the zeppelin and take over the world with King Julien as his partner. While Karl was ranting about his plans, King Julien manages to free Clover and Maurice. When King Julien, Clover, and Maurice exit the zeppelin, they are confronted by Karl who prepares to fire a laser at him until the balloon carrying the rocks with every wishes that the lemurs wrote on them for the Sky God member Frank falls from the sky and lands on Karl. Seeing his \"Surprise Me\" wish roll against him, King Julien took it as a sign that Frank had helped him defeat Karl.\n\nIn \"One More Cup,\" it is revealed that Karl survived and returned where he hooked the whole kingdom on caffeine which was part of his plan. He states he watches King Julien fooling around in the Cove of Wonders instead of following his kingly duties. Karl threw a bag of coffee beans in the ocean and knew that Julien would find it because it has the word \"king\" on it. The hyper kingdom threw out King Julien, Maurice, and Clover. With the help of Mort (who became intelligent from the coffee), they plan to destroy Karl's coffee supply. They approach to Karl's zeppelin while Smart Mort walks through the fields where he meets jumping rats working there. Karl returns, finding them, and tries to destroy them when the jumping rats break through the door demanding a raise from their boss, even the ones cornering Julien, Maurice, and Clover. Later, Karl surrounds the group and prepares to fire his incinerator at Julien until Smart Mort bites him on the foot. King Julien has the weapon and sees that Karl has Mort in his clutches and says that he has one shot, him or Mort. Julien, having no choice, aims the incinerator at the fields destroying the crops leaving Karl devastated worrying what will Bruce will say when he returns from his vacation. King Julien now aims the laser at Karl who states that it charges. Karl escapes in a hot balloon with Chauncey driving it. Karl vows that he will return and will never stop getting rid of King Julien.\n\nIn \"Are You There Frank? It's Me, Julien,\" Karl creates a special armor that allows him to pose as Frank the Sky God in order to get the Lemurs to oppose Frank's brother Larry the Volcano God by sacrificing King Julien. With help from Mort operating the Larry armor that Timo built, King Julien repels Karl. in \"Revenge of the Prom\", Karl reveals that he was in all of Julien's old high school classes, but Julien never noticed him.\n\nIn Exiled, Karl unexpectedly saves King Julien and offers to help him take back his kingdom - if only to destroy him later himself. However, King Julien accidentally destroys Karl's super-weapon, the Karl-Star, and they are both captured by Koto.\n\nIn Season 5, it is revealed Karl's older and domineering brother Bruce has a successful coffee business, and he wants to partner with King Julien - but he ends up buying out Julien and spreading his coffee shops everywhere. Clover and Maurice ally with Karl, who hates his brother for bullying him, and together they ruin his company. At the end it is revealed this was Karl's plan all along, he knew King Julien would cause Bruce's downfall.\n\nIn \"Karlmaggedon\", Karl decides to retire and announces to leave his role as King Julien's arch-nemesis to whoever wins the contest - with Fairfax and Pancho, Tammy and Butterfish, Mort and his Grandpa, and King Julien and Clover contesting for the role (the latter figuring he can be his own nemesis). This all turns out to be a ruse, to keep Julien busy while Karl prepares his ultimate weapon, the Karl-Star to destroy Madagascar with lasers. However, at King Julien's signal, the lemurs use mirrors to make the Karl-Star blow itself up. Julien reveals he expected this from Karl as he always kept bragging about his penchant for using lasers. Defeated, Karl makes good on his promise to retire and travels to Florida with Chauncey on a hot air balloon, admitting that there are no \"not yet, at leasts\" this time.\n\n====Chauncey====\nChauncey (vocal effects provided by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]] who is Karl's pet and henchman. Chauncey spies on King Julien and reports anything he hears to Karl. In the episode \"The Jungle Rooster\", King Julien managed to convince Chauncey to join his side. Eventually, Karl tells Chauncey he would never choose Mary Ann over him and they become best friends again.\n\n===Crimson===\nCrimson (voiced by [[India de Beaufort]]) a red-furred blue-eyed [[crowned lemur]] who is the twin sister of Clover and is the opposite of her. Crimson leaves a trail of destruction everywhere she goes and she wants to marry and then murder King Julien, then move on to another lemur to do the same thing. She even seduces Sage at one point, though only briefly. Later, she allies with Uncle King Julien, aiding him in trying to win his throne back in return for later favors. While competing against Clover in the olympic games, she shows that she still has feelings for her sister when she helps her win. \nIn Exiled, she seems to have abandoned her old boss and moved to an island inhabited with female lemurs, capturing travelers to sacrifice them to a tentacle beast.\nIn Season 5 episode 12, Clover is expecting Sage to propose to her, and is shocked to find that Sage is inviting her to his wedding - to Crimson! Clover tries her best to still be supportive to her friend, and eventually Sage comes to the realization he wants to spend with life with Clover, not Crimson. In episode 13, Crimson shows up during the wedding preparations at the insistence of her ghostly grandmother Rose. She admits to Clover that she was always jealous of her being more successful, and hence tried to prove herself by taking away the things Clover gained - like Sage. Clovers forgives her and the sisters reconcile, with Crimson leading Clover to the altar at the wedding. At the end it is shown she still has not given up on wooing King Julien, though he is not falling for her tricks anymore.\n\n===Rob McTodd (Nurse Phantom)===\nRob McTodd (voiced by [[David Koechner]]) is a lemur who was King Julien's old friend. Maurice never liked Rob as he was a bad influence on Julien, and eventually Uncle King Julien had him banished. Rob returns years later to reconcile, but secretly plans revenge - revealing that he has aged and lost his good looks, he plans to transplant Julien's face to his own. Julien still likes Rob and reconciles with him, and while he has taken up odd habits, such as hibernating in a cave, he seems to have adjusted fine to the changes. Rob now calls himself Nurse Phantom and serves as the assistant to Dr S. - his now deformed face and mannerisms a homage to the Phantom of the Opera. During Exiled, he works with Mort to organize the resistance against Koto.\nIn Season 5, Robb is seemingly restored to his original appearance, only to suddenly be crushed to death in a series of unlikely accidents after warning King Julien that something weird is going on. However it is revealed later that like everyone else, he was replaced with a robot duplicate by Karl. In the last episode, he plays Igor to Dr S. when they create a fake Sage for the wedding.\n\n===Vigman Wildebeests===\nVigman Wildebeests (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a cocky [[blue wildebeest]], he was a rival of Clover's grandmother. In the episode 'Eye of Clover\", he enters the tournament and defeats every player. However he is defeated by Clover when he falls into the Pit of Doom. He is often seen in scenes taking place in Heaven, where he has a rematch against Clover's grandmother Rose.\n\n===Dr. S===\nDr. S (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a cobra who works as a self-taught underworld doctor. Though it takes work to get a doctor's license, Dr. S' claim is that he can't get busted if he practices medicine in his own cave. He was brought to the kingdom by Rob who wanted to use him in his revenge plot, but after reconciling with Julien, the king let them stay. Dr S, while quite the mad scientist, has helped King Julien out in a lot of strange cases with his questionable \"science\" - even bringing the dead to life at one time. He also likes to experiment on willing (and unwilling) subjects, though without much maliciousness. His catchphrase is shouting \"Operating out of a CAAAVEEE!\" which is always accompanied by lightning and thunder.\n\n===Fred the Giant Scorpion===\nFred the Giant Scorpion (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) is a giant scorpion that lives in the desert parts of Madagascar. He apparently had a \"personal problem\" of eating babies, but has reformed. When Clover makes up a story that unfortunately features Fred as the villain (not knowing that he actually exists), it riles him up enough to attack the kingdom. In Exiled, Fred is revealed to have become a guru for a self-help cult. As Clover and Sage are caught up in the cult's brainwashing, they are approached by Fred, who wants out\u2014it is revealed that he just wanted a quick scam but people believed his fake teachings so much, he could not leave. In the end Clover successfully breaks her indoctrination and makes the cult disband, but Pam and Fred quickly start another quick money-making scheme again. In Season 5, Fred shows up for the wedding of Sage and Clover, though he has no dialogue.\n\n===Pam Simonsworthington===\nPam Simonsworthington, voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], is a ridiculously fast lemur who wears goggles. She is a female [[ring-tailed mongoose]]. She first appeared in the episode \"The King and Mrs. Mort\". Since King Julien was being hospitalized, Mort was temporarily the king. Pam arrived at the kingdom and told Mort, who pretended to be Julien, that she was a judge for a contest of which kingdom was the best. Mort showed her around the kingdom nervously. Near the end of the episode, Maurice and Clover do some investigating and find out the truth about Pam. She was a manipulator who ran from kingdom to kingdom marrying kings, robbing the kingdom, and running off. Clover attacks Pam, but she uses her speed to beat Clover up. At the very end, Maurice and Clover round up some kings of other kingdoms, and Clover screams out some of Pam's nicknames like Stephanie Jeeves or Lilly Teeterwagon. The crocodile ambassador complains to Pam, to which she states that he couldn't even give her a proper massage. King Joey just looks confused as usual, and Pam says that he was the easiest one. The shark king complains in shark language. Knowing that she has been caught, Pam uses her super speed to run away. But she is caught in a net trap that Clover made and temporarily captured. The next time she is seen is in the episode \"Cult Fiction\", and she has changed quite a bit. She has apparently given up her job on manipulating kings and is now part of a fake cult that Fred the giant scorpion created. Clover and Sage, who are looking for a weapon that will save the kingdom from Koto and the mountain lemurs, watch a bit. Sage wants to leave, but Clover is sucked in because all of Fred's fake wise words make so much sense to her. Clover's enthusiasm lead to Pam putting her on a higher rank. One night, Fred tells Clover and Sage that everything is fake and he needs their help to escape. They agree, but Clover changes her mind and captures Fred and Sage. But she changes her mind again after a message from Jarsh-Jarsh in a dream and instead deprograms the cult-addicted minds of everyone. Pam however quickly suggests a get-rich scheme to Fred and they start another cult again.\nIn Season 5, Pam shows up disguised as King Julien's popularity manager, Eloise. When King Julien starts \"Facewall\" (a parody of Facebook), and gets obsessed who gets more \"Fleeks\" (likes), Eloise steers him to change his views and entourage to be more liked by his people. This causes Julien to hire Todd to his \"posse\", and fire Clover and Maurice to replace them by a puppet operated by Pancho. However, as the puppet becomes more popular than him, soon the people choose to elect it instead of him, with a disguised Pam planning to marry the puppet and become queen. Clover and Maurice find out though that her \"polls\" were based on asking oblivious children or heavily manipulated. Clover knocks out Eloise, revealing her to be Pam - the first time Clover actually beat her in combat. Pam admits she did not even want the crown anyway, considering the people were stupid enough to elect a puppet. She is locked in jail, and immediately hits on the also imprisoned Pancho.\nPam's personality is very cocky, and she has a loud laugh. Overall, she is not as evil as someone like Koto, but she is still not a very nice person due to her penchant for thievery and manipulation.\n\n===Jarsh-Jarsh===\nJarsh-Jarsh (voiced by [[JB Blanc]]) is a [[mudskipper]] and Sage's mentor. When first encountered by Clover, he seemed to be only able to say his name and spit mud at her and waddle on the ground. After testing Clover's (very tenuous) patience this way, he revealed a map that would lead them to the ultimate weapon. In the end it was revealed to have been another of Jarsh-Jarsh's tests itself. Jarsh-Jarsh then body-swapped Sage and Clover, which lead to Sage experiencing anger and rage, he beat up his mentor when Jarsh-Jarsh mocked him - until Clover, in Sage's body, intervened. Jarsh-Jarsh then revealed that this was the final test all along - so each of them understands the other and their anger and calmness balance themselves out. In Season 5, Jarsh-Jarsh shows up in the last episode, attending Sage and Clover's wedding - Sage had to pick him up as he does not travel by hawk, causing him to be late to his wedding.\n\n===Koto===\nKoto (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) is a mountain lemur, and Sage's brother. He is the antithesis of his sibling - cruel, domineering, aggressive and manipulative. First appearing at the end of Season 4, Koto is rescued from a snake by King Julien, who shows him around the kingdom - little suspecting that Koto was simply scouting ahead for a kingdom to take over. At the end of the season, Koto arrives with his mountain lemur army and conquers King Julien's kingdom, as well as the neighbouring ones like the rats or the crocodiles. He takes Julien's crown and enslaves the people, forcing them to work on his statue.\n\nIn ''Exiled'', Koto has to deal with the underground rebellion started by Mort, who eventually escapes. Sage also gives one last try to reconcile with his brother by reminding them of their childhood bond, but Koto mocks his sentiments. When King Julien returns, having raised an army from the friends encountered during his voyage, they are initially successful, but Julien is forced to surrender to save his friends. Koto plans to force Clover into marriage, and execute King Julien at the wedding - however an attack led by Maurice and Mort saves them. Koto has a showdown with his brother Sage, who defeats him but spares his life at Clover's request. Koto tries to backstab King Julien anyway, which causes his statue to collapse on top of him, ending his reign of terror. In Season 5, Koto is shown in Frankri-La with the Pineapple and all the characters who died in the series.\n\n===Zora===\nA female mountain lemur who arrived with Koto but fell in love with Mort during ''Exiled''. She marries him in Season 5 but they later break up. Later, Uncle King Julien falls in love with her and she's smitten with him. He renounces his evil ways for her and they leave together.\n\nThe two show up again in the last episode, attending Clover and Sage's wedding.\n\n===Grandpa Mort===\nGrandpa Mort (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a wizened old mouse lemur. Though Mort only has vague memories of him, he indeed seems to be his grandfather, but was imprisoned decades ago due to conspiring against one of King Julien's ancestors. Grandpa Mort shows up in \"Karlmaggedon\" to offer one of the golden mangoes to Mort, so they can join the contest to become the new nemesis of King Julien. It is revealed at the end of the contest that he only wants to make Mort turn to evil, as is in his blood, and help him fulfill his destiny of destroying King Julien. When Mort refuses, Grandpa Mort reveals the Mort family line always absorbs the essence of the weaker ones, hence ensuring only the most evil remain, and attempts to do the same to Mort. While he succeeds, he then suddenly explodes, with Mort absorbing his essence instead.\n\n===Captain Ethan===\nCaptain Ethan (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is a rat who is the leader of the pirates that operate in the waters of Madagascar.\n\n===Lil' Arms Magee===\nLil' Arms Magee (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) was a crocodile that worked for Captain Ethan. Magee, along with One-Eyed Simon and No Name Jack, worked for Ethan's crew of pirates that operated the waters near Madagascar. Magee was first seen in the episode \"O' Captain my Captain-Part 1\". His crew was sparring while King Julien, who had just gotten captured, watched. At the end, Jimmy was thrown overboard due to his lack of fighting skills. Throughout the three episodes that Magee appeared in, he was shown to have tiny arms just like the rest of his kind, and that resulted in stress. For example, when Julien tried to escape, he told Magee that there was a contest to see who could give Ethan the best hug. Magee is sad because he realizes that he would never win. But Julien offers to coach him only because he thinks he can grab the key to the jail cell. Out of all the pirates, Magee was shown to always have the most support for Julien. When Julien became captain and asked pirates questions about what they did, Magee and the other pirates sang him a song. Later, when Mort and Clover invaded to rescue Julien, Magee attacked them along with his mates. Magee was shown to have been knocked out by Clover along with Simon and jack. But later, the pirates woke up and chased down Julien, Mort, and Clover. Ethan was knocked out though, and Julien charmed the rest of the pirates with mangoes and got them to sail away. In the episode 'The Love Gauntlet,', when Karl and Chauncey's plan to drown Julien and his parents in a volcano failed, Karl recruited the pirates to attack them. But Ethan missed Julien on a charge and drowned in the volcano, and Julien charmed the rest of the pirates with trophies to chase Karl and Chauncey away. Magee and his mates decided to give Julien's parents a ride back to their island later, and Magee was never seen nor mentioned ever again.\n\n===Horton===\nHorton is not a well-known character. He is a lemur of the kingdom. Horton appeared once, in the episode \"Diapers are the New Black\". He is wearing a diaper, and he and other lemurs are making fun of diaper-less lemurs like Ted and Dorothy. Horton is laughing at them, but a few seconds later, his diaper has been stolen. Ted is accused, and a big fight breaks out. Horton's name is revealed when Clover tells King Julien and Maurice that someone stole his diaper. He is never seen or mentioned again.\n\n===Jeffrey===\nJeffrey is a random lemur of the kingdom. He has no lines. He appeared in the episode \"Fast Food Lemur Nation\". Jeffrey is not a well-known character. His name is revealed when King Julien says hi to him while he, along with the whole kingdom, was being magnetized by a gigantic magnet. Jeffrey is the same color as most of the kingdom, which is light gray. His status is unknown because he is never seen or mentioned again after that.\n\n===Andy Fairfax===\nAndy Fairfax (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) is a bat who is involved in trickery, particularly to sell things. In the episode \u201cGet Off My Lawn,\u201d he slyly sells all the lemurs in the kingdom protection scorpions, leaving Clover without a job. He is seen in many episodes selling things to unknowing people, like a comfort Mort in \u201cJulien 2.0.\u201d He and Pancho are often seen together robbing houses, as seen in \u201cThe All Hail King Julien Show.\u201d Often he uses his charming personality to fool others. Apparently he and Pancho met at a summer camp for grown-ups that lasted for 3\u20135 years.\n\n===Mary-Ann===\nMary-Ann (voiced by [[Debra Wilson]]) is a female [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] and Horst's secret-lover.\n\n==Merry Madagascar characters==\n\n===Donner===\nDonner (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) is the leader of Santa Claus' [[reindeer]]. His name is revealed in \"Santa Claus is Coming To Madagascar\".\n\n===Cupid===\nCupid (voiced by [[Nina Dobrev]]) is one of Santa Claus' [[reindeer]] who falls in love with Private.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}\nSean Axmaker of ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' praised the characters, noting the \"marvelous character animation\" and \"the palpable camaraderie between animal buddies\" kept ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'' \"rolling\".<ref name=\"rolling\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/386714_madagascar07q.html |date=November 6, 2008 |title=Want to escape?

He is best friends with [[#Marty|Marty]] the [[Plains zebra|zebra]] ([[Chris Rock]]). He is used to the life of comfort in the zoo but learns to adapt to the wild. He's smart, quick thinking and fast on his feet. He is a dancer by nature, often impressing others with his aerobatic feats. He does tend to be a little self-absorbed, often not seeing the problems of others above his own.\n\nAlex enjoys his life at the zoo and has plenty of friends and is surprised when hearing Marty's wish to leave and live in the wild (or run free in [[Connecticut]] as stated in the movie).<ref>\"Madagascar\"</ref> As a cub, Alex was born on an African wildlife reserve and named Alakay. He has brown and yellow fur, whiskers, a black nose, a big mane, and a long tufted tail. He was the son of the alpha lion, [[#Zuba|Zuba]] ([[Bernie Mac]]), and was constantly given lessons on hunting, though he displayed no interest in the activity. During one of the sessions, Alex was captured by [[Poaching|poachers]], but the crate he was contained in fell into a river and eventually floated to New York. He is found by humans who renamed him Alex and took to the Central Park Zoo. In ''Madagascar'', after Marty, Alex's best friend, leaves in an effort to take a train to the wild, Alex, [[#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]] ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]), and [[#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) pursue him and are shot with tranquilizer darts by humans. The animal-rights activists pressure the zoo into releasing them back into the wild, but on the ship to the preserve, Alex and his friends fall into the ocean. They wash ashore on [[Madagascar]], and, while Marty is excited to be free, Alex wishes to go home. He grows very hungry after days of being unable to eat, not realizing that steak is animal flesh. Hunger drives Alex into a crazed state, and after almost killing Marty in hunger (by biting him on the butt when he thought it was a piece of steak), in a moment of lucidity, he goes into self-imposed exile, barricading himself in the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] territory of the island. Marty pursues him, unwilling to leave his friend, but is attacked by the fossa, the native predators of Madagascar. Alex works to defend Marty and is later given [[sushi]] by the penguins to satiate his hunger.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Alex encounters his parents, Zuba and [[#Florrie|Florrie]] ([[Sherri Shepherd]]), who are overjoyed to see their son and he becomes co-alpha lion alongside his father.\n\nZuba assumes Alex is strong after hearing he is the \"King\" of New York and arranges a rite of passage into the pride. [[#Makunga|Makunga]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]), Zuba's rival, persuades Alex to challenge [[#Teetsi|Teetsi]] during the Alex's [[rite of passage]]. Teetsi was revealed to be a bulky, strong lion and Alex is quickly defeated by him. To keep from banishing Alex, Zuba transfers his control to Makunga, and in turn, he, Florrie, and Alex are banished. Zuba soon grows unaccepting of Alex after realizing he is not a fierce warrior. The next day, the watering hole is shown to be dried up and Alex leaves with Marty to find out the cause. They leave the safety of the reserve, prompting Zuba to follow Alex and bring him back. Alex discovers that the stranded New Yorkers had created a dam, and through the use of dancing, he is recognized by the attacking New Yorkers. With the help of others, the dam is destroyed and they return to the preserve. His father learns to respect his habits, and they remain in Africa instead of flying home with the penguins. In ''The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper'', a stuffed animal Alex is seen briefly and its head is quickly dismembered by Nana's toy poodle, Mr. Chew. Alex has small cameos with his friends celebrating Christmas and singing a version of \"[[Jingle Bells]]\".\n\nThe fact that Alex loses the challenge to Teetsi and is spanked by Nana in ''Madagascar'' gives him the impression he is a horrible fighter, but this is not true, because (in the Nana case), she only gets Alex by surprise, but was more visible when in ''Madagascar 2'', he has a short, but equilibrated{{clarify|date=November 2014}} fight against Nana. Alex is shown to have a superhuman level of interior physical strength, seeing that he broke the zoo's public telephone, and lifts Melman, Marty and Gloria with relative ease.\n\nAlex made another appearance in \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole.\" Wally Wingert reprises his role from the first video game. In the show, he appeared as a hallucination \"spirit guide\" to help Skipper, whose memories had been stolen by the evil Dr. Blowhole. At first, Skipper thought he was very talkative and annoying, but soon he accepted his guidance, especially when he had to face Blowhole when he got back to New York City. A running gag in the episode is that Skipper's friends are confused and convinced he's crazy when they see him talk to Alex, since only Skipper can see him. After Dr. Blowhole was defeated, Alex's spirit guide form disappeared.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', it opens on Alex's birthday and after a present from his friends of a mud New York he is determined to get the penguins from [[Monte Carlo]]. Alex creates four phases and after a fight with his friends they are exposed and are pursued by Captain Chantel DuBois.\n\nAfter cutting the DuBois' snare they fly back to New York until they crash in a train yard. Alex is determined to get back home and tries to fix the plane but fails. Then he persuades [[#Gia|Gia]] ([[Jessica Chastain]]) a [[North American jaguar|jaguar]] to let them on the train, with whom he is smitten upon first sight. After being let on the train Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria realized that this was a ticket home.\n\nAfter a failing performance in Rome, he gives a pep talk and has the circus spiced up to get the circus promoter for a tour in America. Stefano told Alex why [[#Vitaly|Vitaly]] ([[Bryan Cranston]]) the [[Siberian tiger]] was grouchy. Alex teaches Gia trapeze, and they begin to fall deeply in love. The London performance was better and they go to America. DuBois came to \"take home\" Alex but gets shot out of a cannon. Alex tells them why they had to join the circus.\n\nAlex gives another pep talk to his friends and Julien that they were wrong and they decide to go back until DuBois comes. Awakening, Alex realizes they are back in the zoo with iron cage links between them. Luckily the circus came and rescued him. But DuBois is still determined to get Alex's head and is taking Stefano. But Alex saves the day (with Gia's help) by saving [[#Stefano|Stefano]] ([[Martin Short]]), a [[sea lion]], and defeating DuBois.\n\n===Marty===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Marty\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Chris Rock]] (films and TV specials)<br />[[Phil LaMarr]] (video games)<br />Thomas Stanley (foal)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Plains zebra]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n|| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMarty is a male [[plains zebra]] who used to live at the Central Park Zoo, and is a good friend of [[#Alex|Alex]] the [[lion]]. He once had an [[iPod]] before Alex accidentally broke it. Marty likes seaweed on a stick.\n\nMarty is a hopeless [[optimism|optimist]]; he usually sees the brighter side of many things, taking every situation in stride. He has black and white stripes, a furry coat, a mane, and a tufted tail. He strives to be unique, which proves difficult when he meets his own kind in Africa, who look and act almost exactly the same. Marty is best friends with Alex and the two are rarely at odds. His carefree lifestyle tends to get on the nerves of his friends, but mostly serves to impress them; he is the one who helps hold the group together when things seem to get down.\n\nMarty lived a life of comfort in the zoo. After his tenth birthday had come and gone, meaning that his life was already half over, Marty decided that never having seen the wild, he must travel to the wild, for at least a short time.\n\nIn the movie, Alex says he's black with white stripes, as he has 30 black, and only 29 white, but this was partly because Alex had to give an explanation as to why he was licking Marty, as he thought he was the steak in his dream.\n\nThe film begins on Marty\u2019s 10th birthday (middle-aged for a zebra). His friends try to give him a great birthday, but somehow, Marty wants more. He escapes the [[Central Park Zoo]], where he had lived for the past ten years, and makes a dash for the wild. His friends, Alex, [[#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]], and [[#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]], flag him down, but as they are about to take him back to the zoo, police officers and animal control officers appear in all directions, tranquilize the animals, and send them on a ship to a wildlife preserve in [[Kenya]]. The [[#Penguins|penguins]] take over the ship and the four friends are washed up on the shores of [[Madagascar]].\n\nOnce on the island, Marty had his dream fulfilled. Marty sets up a \"bar\" on the island, known as \"Casa del Wild\" (in English ''Home of the Wild''). Alex is mad at Marty for getting them shipped to the wild, but he later apologizes to Marty and actually begins to enjoy himself on the island. Unfortunately, his enjoyment brings on his killer instincts, causing him to attack the resident lemurs and his friends, including Marty. Alex does not \"go savage\" for long, and after regaining his senses, he runs away from his friends out of regret. Soon after that, Marty learns the hard way that the wild is not what it seems to be, and how hard it really is for many animals to live there with so many predators and other dangers. Realizing the consequences brought upon by his impulsive actions, such as sacrificing his and the other's lives at the Zoo (the one safe place they called home) and the misfortune he caused his best friend, Marty comes to truly regret his birthday wish. However, after learning of the penguins having hijacked a boat and are offering the zoo animals a trip back home, Marty immediately runs after Alex in hopes to save his friend. Alex is later able to rejoin his friends as they head back to the zoo.\n\nMarty, along with his friends, has only a few small cameos in ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]''. He, Alex, and Gloria are seen at the beginning decorating Melman's neck with Christmas lights. At the end, he, his friends, and almost all the other zoo animals are seen singing their own version of \"Jingle Bells\".\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Marty (along with Alex, Melman, Gloria, Hannah, the lemurs, and the penguins) finds himself stranded in Africa after a failed attempt at flying to New York. There, he joins a herd of zebra that all look and sound exactly like him. While he enjoys this new lifestyle at first, he quickly becomes depressed when it becomes evident he has no individuality in a herd. Marty also becomes upset when Alex is unable to tell him apart from the other zebras. Ultimately, Alex is able to make amends by picking Marty out of the herd (later revealed to be due to the bite mark left on his backside from the previous film, and the fact that he is black with white stripes, while the other zebras are all white with black stripes.) Marty accompanies his friend to unblock a dam set by stranded New Yorkers in the jungle (which causes the watering hole to dry up). When Alex is caught, Marty gets the other animals to help rescue him.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', Marty joins the circus along with the others. His circus act is cannon along with [[#Stefano|Stefano]] the [[New Zealand sea lion|sea lion]]. In the middle of the film, you can tell he loves the afro. At the end of the film, it is shown that Marty is dancing in his afro (along with the others) to the tune Afro Circus / I like to Move it.\n\n===Melman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Melman Mankiewicz III\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[David Schwimmer]] (films and TV specials)<br />[[Stephen Stanton]] (video games)<br />[[Zachary Gordon]] (calf)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Reticulated giraffe]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMelman Mankiewicz III is a male [[reticulated giraffe]]. He has a furry coat, green eyes, whiskers, a snout, a long neck, brown spots, horns, and a tufted tail. He is somewhat of a [[hypochondriac]], having doses of medicine for meals and doctor's appointments frequently. He even complains about having brown spots on his neck (the spots, in real life, are natural).\n\nHe is skittish most of the time, but often has moments of profound clarity. His experience being medicated has given him insight regarding how to treat sick or injured animals who might otherwise give up hope and dig a hole, waiting to die in it. His love for Gloria is deep, and is always a gentleman to her; to Marty and Alex, he's just another one of the \"awkward\" guys.\n\nMelman had a residence at the Central Park Zoo, where he received constant medical treatment for problems that were all psychosomatic. He would undergo MRIs, CAT scans, injections, flu shots, and be put into braces and crutches for no particular purpose at all. In the Central Park Zoo, Melman was used to his cushy life taking pills and undergoing treatments. One night, Marty the Zebra escaped and Melman immediately informed Alex of this.\n\nIn a flashback in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', there is a hint that he had a crush on Gloria as a child (as he seems uncomfortable when she comments that Alex is cute). When the animals nearly die trying to fly back to New York in a salvaged airplane, he screams he is in love with Gloria; she is asleep and does not hear. In Africa, Melman is horrified to learn that once a giraffe becomes sick, it has no way to survive and therefore must simply wait in a hole to die. He takes the position of Witch Doctor to cure sick animals, introducing them to Western medicine and giving them longer and better lives.\n\nWhile he proves to be a very good witch doctor, he is informed by another giraffe that Melman has a brown spot on his shoulder, one which the previous Witch Doctor seemed to have gotten and \"was gone\" two days later. Thinking he only has two days to live, Melman initially waits in a hole, but then takes King Julien's advice and goes to declare his love to Gloria. He finds her on a date and simply tells her date what a wonderful girl Gloria is and to treat her right. When the watering hole dries up and King Julien decides to sacrifice an animal for the water gods, Melman offers himself. He is saved at the last moment, when Gloria tells him that she loves him back, and the two become a couple; it becomes apparent the \"brown spot\" was not fatal (the previous Witch Doctor is found alive and well, the brown spot in fact being a natural giraffe spot); however, there is not a scene where Melman is told of this. It is assumed that he figured it out when his \"time\" came and went and he was fine. He was last seen dancing off into the sunset with Gloria, Alex and Marty.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', Melman and Gloria are still together. They and the other animals go to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. Once inside the hotel, Melman, Alex and Marty argue over who should be the leader of the group. They are crushed by Gloria's weight and they fall into the casino. Whilst escaping the hotel with the other animals, they are pursued by DuBois. On the way they lose DuBois and manage to reach the Hotel Ambassador. While boarding the plane, Melman is grabbed by the neck when DuBois appears. Alex with a little help from Mort, cuts the rope and saves Melman.\n\nAbove the skies of France, the plane's engine fails and it crash lands into a suburban rail yard. Whilst running from the authorities who are closing in on them, Melman gives Alex the idea of boarding the train containing the circus. Upon arrival in Rome, Melman and the group realize how terrible the circus was. En route to London, Melman and the others are discussing how terrible the circus was before Alex tells them about his newfound inspiration.\n\nMelman and Gloria create a dancing tightrope act that is performed in London. When Melman and his friends are pursued by DuBois, the circus discover their true identities.\n\n=== Gloria ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Gloria\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] (films and TV specials)<br />[[Bettina Bush]] (video games)<br />[[Willow Smith]] (calf)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Common hippopotamus]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nGloria is a female [[hippopotamus]] who resided in the [[Central Park Zoo]] as an attraction, all the while being good friends with Alex, Marty, Melman, and becoming the latter's girlfriend as of ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa''. She has gray skin, brown eyes, a snout, short arms and legs, black fingernails, an enormously fat belly, short stubby tail, and a triangular belly button. Gloria comically serves as the height of the gang, both intentionally and in situations she accidentally falls into. She is often serious with what she is talking about and the guys are careful not to get on her nerves.\n\nAs a hippopotamus, Gloria is another animal in the Central Park Zoo and was one of the many attractions, drawing crowds that enjoyed seeing her swim about in her water tank. She would also receive the star treatment as one of the zoo's main attractions and attend Marty\u2019s birthday party. At this party, Marty announced his wish upon blowing out the candles on his cake: to go to the wild. Gloria, Alex and Melman tried to have Marty come to his senses by telling him life out in the wilds was savage and difficult, whereas life in the zoos was adequate. Marty was unhappy at hearing this, and Gloria told Alex to go to console Marty. Later that night, Marty acted out his wish and headed straight for the Terminal Station to take a train and go to Connecticut, where Marty heard wide open spaces were found. Gloria urged both Alex and Melman to come with her to find Marty and bring him back before any people would notice. They were found, regardless, along with Mason and Phil, the two chimps, and a troupe of secretive penguins, all ending up tranquilized with darts.\n\nWhen they all came to, they found themselves in crates bound for Africa. When the penguins hijack the ship, the crates fall into the ocean and wash up on the island of Madagascar. After some confusion, they start to set up their own society and attract the attention of a lemur colony.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Gloria expresses a desire to join in the zoo breeding program, in the hopes of finding a boyfriend. When the animals crash land in Africa, she attracts the attention of a hippo named Moto Moto. Though she thinks he is the ideal boyfriend at first, she realizes that he only loves her for her size, whereas Melman loves her for who she is. Realizing that she loves Melman back, she stops him from sacrificing himself into the volcano, even saying \"It's crazy to think that I had to go halfway around the world to find the perfect guy was right next door...\" and then joins the other animals in rescuing Alex from Nana.\n\nGloria returns in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' with Melman, the couple finds their way as they contribute to the circus' success with a spectacular tightrope act.\n\n===The Penguins===\nA group of the NYC [[ad\u00e9lie penguin]] spies. Skipper is a major character in the first film, but Kowalski, Rico, and Private are supporting characters and don't talk much until ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]''. All four penguins have major roles in the first sequel and supporting roles in the second sequel.\n\n====Skipper====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Skipper\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nSkipper is the leader of the [[ad\u00e9lie penguin]]s (despite their color-schemes not matching the real species) and is the main character in the TV show. He has dark, [[sapphire (color)|sapphire]]-blue eyes and his head is flatter than those of the other three penguins. Like the rest of the penguins, he has no idea what is expected of the penguin species, other than to \"smile and wave.\" At one point, Private used a bird biology book to tell the other penguins how to act, but since the penguins usually need the chimpanzees Phil and Mason to translate for them, it was unclear how either he or Private were able to read the biology book, which is presumably written in English. His sidekicks, Kowalski, Rico, and Private don't talk much until ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]''.\n\nIn the first ''Madagascar'' movie, Skipper is the mastermind behind a plot to escape the confines of the zoo and leave for Antarctica. Kowalski, Rico, and Private are his accomplices in this plot. They dig under their enclosure until they reach Marty the zebra, thinking it to be the South Pole. Skipper explains to Marty that they are attempting to escape the zoo because penguins do not belong there in captivity. He then orders his accomplices to continue tunneling. Late that night, Skipper and the other penguins are caught by a SWAT team, as are six other animals found outside the zoo. The penguins are tranquilized and put into a crate to be transferred.\n\nWhen they awake, Skipper is confused at the lettering on the crate where they are being held and orders Mason to read it; Mason's companion Phil reads it. According to the box, they are all bound for a wildlife preserve in Africa, despite the cold climate penguins need. Skipper orders Rico to pick the lock on the crate where they are held, whereupon the four penguins knock out the crew and take command of the ship, commandeering it to reach Antarctica. Skipper and his mates finally reach Antarctica and are sorely disappointed by the barren, desolate terrain (as evidenced by Private's exclamation, \"Well, this sucks...\") Skipper has the ship return quickly from the South Pole, where it crashes into the beaches of Madagascar and a much warmer climate. Upon arriving, he and the other three encounter Gloria and Melman, and see that Alex and Marty (whom they refer to as their \"monochromatic friend\") are gone. Skipper decides to help rescue Marty from the grim fate of being eaten by the native foossa (possibly as gratitude for Marty\u2019s silence regarding the escape). It is Skipper who helps to distract the foossa while Marty is recovered, and also helps fight off a number of them.\n\nSkipper notices later on that Alex is still hungry, not having been able to eat steak, and has Rico prepare sushi for Alex. Skipper then relinquishes control of the ship to Alex, as he no longer needs it, and proceeds to sunbathe on the tropical beaches in comfort. Skipper is asked by Private if they should tell Alex and his friends that the ship is out of gas. Skipper declines, telling his troupe to \"Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave.\"\n\nIn ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', Skipper and the penguins salvage a crashed airplane to fly back to New York. They fix the plane when it crashes in Africa with the help of \"more thumbs\" (Mason and Phil). At the end of the movie, he marries a [[bobblehead]] doll. In ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', the bobblehead is nowhere to be seen.\n\nIn ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'', it is revealed that Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private, along with Mason and Phil, have been in Monte Carlo. With Phil dressed as the \"King of Versailles,\" they are able to amass a fortune of jewels, diamonds and gold and plan to buy an aircraft to pick up the \"hippies\" (Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman) in Africa and return to New York. Things change when Alex and the others rush to Monte Casino, believing that the penguins have abandoned them. Skipper later uses the fortune to help the gang become part of a traveling circus. After saving the gang skipper turns to a life of crime and soon creates a mafia known as the Frozen Tuxedos. skipper and his original crew control Europe with an iron fist. soon after this skipper launches an attack on the US plunging the world into World War Three.\n\n\nSkipper is one of the four main characters of ''The Penguins of Madagascar''. In the show, many things are revealed about him and it expands on his character from the movies. In multiple episodes it is shown that Skipper knows karate and is an exceptionally capable fighter. He's also very strong, as seen in \"Launchtime.\" In \"Crown Fools,\" he states that he had taken down an angry walrus with \"a wing and a prayer and another wing\". However, in \"Needle Point\", it is revealed that he has [[Trypanophobia|a fear of needles]], so in later episodes if he's injured he's treated with medical cream or the like. Generally, he is a straight man, displaying a very stereotypical general personality when not in battle: he's been shown waking his men up early in the morning for training, has given them trials on being able to work without him a number of times, and has been shown to being very hard-boiled. He is, though, soft on his men at times, properly rewarding them and even showing fear and worry when he knows they're in danger. He becomes especially upset when he believes one of them to be dead. He often tries to hide this part, as he once told Private that he (Private) is always bait because he \"is gullible and expendable,\" but later becomes upset when Private is eaten.\n\nAlthough Skipper's plans and theories often serve as jokes, his most unorthodox theories are sometimes proven true; the Blowhole existence is the most extreme example of this. Doctor Blowhole is first mentioned in \"Eclipsed\", when Skipper brings up his plan to extinguish the sun; this is because the sun was covered by a solar eclipse and, before Mason, Phil, and Kowalski mentioned it, Skipper believed he finally succeeded. Skipper being paranoid often comes up due to his theories, and whether or not he's right depends on the episode. Often, those around him refuse to follow along, mostly Marlene because she believes Skipper overreacts. He often comes up with theories without basis on new arrivals, usually flying [[piranha]] or being a spy for Doctor Blowhole. According to him, there are actually 8 continents, since he counts [[Atlantis]] (and appears to believe it is off the coast of Brazil). He once tells Maurice that if he had Skipper's security clearance, he would believe it too. Skipper indicates that he believes that some new arrivals to the zoo could be flying [[piranha]]. In the episode \"Launchtime,\" when he asks Kowalski to search for a place where nearly no lemurs can be found, he states that he cannot set foot in Denmark; when Private questions him on this, he replies by saying \"Well, that's private, Private, between me and the Danes.\" It is later revealed that the incident in question was caused by Hans the Puffin, revolving around a fish fight and top secret documents that made them both public enemy number one.\n\nSkipper has mentioned that there used to be two more penguins (Manfredi and Johnson, named for two ill-fated characters in the [[World War II]] prisoner-of-war saga [[Stalag 17#Plot synopsis|Stalag 17]]) in addition to himself and the other three; this is unconfirmed, and these claims have never been adequately explained. When they're brought up, it's usually as a warning or an aside remark, as they died in the past during a mission. In \"The Hidden\", he mentions that they died during a mission when they were attacked by \"flying piranhas\" and that they had to \"bury what was left of them with a tea spoon\". In \"A Kipper for Skipper,\" when Skipper states that \"relatively few penguins get left behind\", as the others point out that Manfredi, Johnson, and another penguin were. In \"Roger Dodger,\" he tells Rico that he would take him out if he had to and tells him \"just ask Manfredi and Johnson.\" In \"An Elephant Never Forgets,\" he tells them that while he was training Private that Manfredi and Johnson \"fell for the exploding elephant foot.\" They are also mentioned by Private, who claims that they mistook the hind end of a [[beluga whale]] for an escape tunnel. In \"Maurice at Peace,\" it is implied that they were accidentally smothered by the others due to a misinterpretation of a message which actually said to smother them with affection. In \"Smotherly Love,\" it is mentioned that they died a very relaxing death in a day spa.\n\nIn ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', he uses some Italian words such as \"Sempre all'erta\" (in \"Haunted Habitat\"), \"Bravissimo\" (in \"The Hidden\"), \"Attenzione\" (in \"Crown Fools\"), \"Eccellente\" (in \"Kingdom Come\"), \"Finito!\" (in \"Popcorn Panic\") and \"Perfetto\" (in \"An Elephant Never Forgets\"). His Italian pronunciation is not perfect. In \"The Falcon and the Snow Job,\" Skipper falls for a female [[Peregrine falcon]] named Kitka and they date for a while. Skipper breaks up with her after it is revealed that she had swallowed Fred the squirrel, and in subsequent episodes she wasn't heard from or mentioned.\n\nSkipper shares a very strong friendship with Marlene, a female Asian Otter who lives across from the penguins and is a main character in the series. Despite their conflicting differences and clashes of personality, the two still remain very close and are able to keep their bond of friendship strong. Marlene is also considered \"privileged\" by Skipper, due to the fact that he thinks of her as a smart, which is rather unusual, considering his otherwise generally scornful opinion of mammals. He sometimes allows her to tag along on missions.\n\nAs the series ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' continues, Skipper starts to realize that Private is following in his footsteps in \"Private and the Winky-Factory.\" Skipper also becomes less sensitive to his enemies Dr. Blowhole and Hans the Puffin. Over the course of the series, he likes and trusts them less and less. In the Dr. Blowhole Special \"Blowhole Strikes Back,\" Hans and Skipper are referred to as \"frenemies.\" At the beginning of the episode, Hans surprises Skipper by meeting him in China and refers to him as such.\n\n====Kowalski====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Kowalski\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] (films and other media)<br />[[Jeff Bennett]] (''The Penguins of Madagascar'')\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nKowalski is [[second-in-command]] and the tallest of the penguins, forming plans for the group and usually taking notes for Skipper. When Skipper is absent, he takes charge and his rank is [[First Lieutenant]]. He has blue eyes and tends to over-analyze situations.\n\nOften formulating plans for the group, Kowalski is a loyal supporter of his leader, Skipper. Kowalski had escaped the zoo with the other penguins but was promptly captured and put into a crate for transfer with his comrades. The crates were all placed on a ship bound for Africa, where all the creatures from the zoo would be kept in a wildlife preserve. While in the crate, Kowalski confessed that he could not read (he said the words on the side of the box were an \"older code\", in slight reference to ''Return of the Jedi'') and asked another transferee, a chimpanzee named Phil, to read the words on the crate. As soon as this was done, the four penguins headed to the ship's bridge, knocked out the crew and captain, bound them up, and Kowalski plotted the ship's course to Antarctica.\n\nHe is the [[technician]] of the group and always has his notepad (and an [[abacus]] in the animated series). While being able to formulate plans and invent things (such as a rocket ship out of a trashcan and fireworks, a futuristic rotary saw blade made of energy and multiple random objects, or an intelligence sucking machine from just a [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] box, a magnet, and a vacuum) he is shown to have a bit of difficulty deducing simpler machines. At the end of \"Needle Point\", it is revealed that he has a fear of zoological oral checks. He seems to also spout nearly or completely nonsensical words, such as, \"The moo cow may have a chocolate marshmallow\", or \"I'll be a bicycle cream cone\", whenever either hit incredibly hard (as he did when body checked by a giant rat during a hockey game) or when shocked severely (as by Officer X's stun gun). He screamed \"[[Galileo Galilei]]\" when he got his injection during \"Needle Point\". He also loves candy.\n\nIn the series he is shown to be intelligent but it is not as apparent in the films, which reveal that he does not know how to read (English) (e.g. in ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', he states that the paper plane would help them fly back to New York and he does not understand that the fuel indicator was indicating that fuel is finished; and in ''Penguins of Madagascar'' he wrongly calculated that they arrived in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], when in reality they arrived in [[Shanghai]]). He does most of his calculations on an abacus, although he was briefly in possession of a calculator that was destroyed. He is in love with a dolphin called Doris and recorded a poem for her on DVD which highlighted her apparent non-interest in him in the \"Hot Ice\" episode. (She was first mentioned in \"Gone in a Flash\" with a photo being shown.)\n\nIt has been noted that his inventions have a habit of horribly backfiring regardless of his best intentions or their successes. Some of his most significant blunders include: a time machine (or 'Chronotron') that triggered a temporal rift that nearly destroyed reality and resulted in three of Kowalski appearing in one place (noticeably, the first Kowalski from the future wanted to stop the ray and the second one wanted it to keep working); a youth ray (designed to return spoiled food to its fresher state) that turned Skipper into a chick; a mind-switching machine (which backfired in its first use because he forgot to take the warm-blooded/cold-blooded conflict into account when switching Rico with Roger); a device called the \"Chronocurbulator\" that stops time that left time seemingly permanently frozen when it broke down; a helmet that granted the user the power of telekinesis; an invisibility ray (or 'Transparent Matter-Maker', called 'Transmatterer' for short due to copyright issues) that turned itself invisible before being set to randomly fire; a mind-reading machine that quickly burnt out due to lack of processing power; a cloning machine that relied on the Higgs Boson particle for power; nanites that could reprogram other machines (these were programmed to not harm a penguin, but this backfired when they locked the penguins in their habitat to 'protect' them); and the artificially engineered life-form 'Jiggles', who consumed the zoo's fruit and nearly destroyed the zoo when it grew to monstrous size. In ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'', an invention of his called a \"nucular\" reactor (sic) is used.\n\nAs a result of his inventions, he comes off as unhinged, especially when he becomes overly defensive about what he does. Outright called a mad scientist by Skipper, Kowalski often creates things in order to \"show them\" and has, on few occasions, hidden his devices. In \"I Know Why The Caged Bird Goes Insane\", he becomes increasingly derailed as the episode goes on after being temporarily bound to a wheelchair, mostly because the nursery he was being held in was right next door to the Science Expo, and he makes a few attempts to break out.\n\nKowalski can play a banjo and sing as seen in the episode \"Concrete Jungle Survival\".\n\n====Rico====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Rico\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] (''Madagascar'')<br />[[John DiMaggio]] (most media)<br />[[Fred Tatasciore]] (second video game)<br />[[Conrad Vernon]] (''Penguins of Madagascar'')\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator    = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nRico, third-in-command of the penguins, does not really talk too much. He is similar in physical features to the other penguins in the movies, but he has a tuft of feathers shaped like a Mohawk and a scar of unknown origin on his left cheek in the television series, which makes him easier to distinguish, particularly from Skipper. Rico is the greediest and fattest of the penguins - he will eat almost anything, and thinks constantly of food. Skipper describes him as \"clearly a world-class psychopath\". Rico appears to be not merely particularly psychotic, but to some degree mentally deficient. In \"Friend in a Box\" Kowalski points a mind-reading device at him which, despite seeming to function perfectly for the other three penguins, picks up only the word 'Fish' being thought by Rico. According to Skipper, it was a mystery how Rico passed the psych test. On the other hand, in \"Cat's Cradle\" Skipper tells Rico to demonstrate shutting off all unnecessary brain functions to conserve oxygen, and Rico seems to 'deactivate' by deflating his entire body.\n\nIn the first and second film, what little speech Rico used suggested that his native language is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and his [[sushi]]-preparation skills added to this idea. However, in the TV series, he communicated with excitable garbled grunts, but could still manage short sentences in English, and his language further improved by the second season. He has also displayed a fondness for a plastic doll toy called Miss Perky. He's the team's weapons expert and his main function is to [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitate]] any necessary tools that Skipper may need for a mission. His stomach operates as a [[hammer space]], containing items as large or larger than himself, or that weigh much more than common sense would allow, with no ill effect on himself. He can swallow and regurgitate almost anything from paperclips and explosives, all the way to a running chainsaw and ground-to-air missile. As the show went on, characters could actually reach inside him and pull things out. His stomach even contains a spiral staircase and elevator, and he can swallow other characters and regurgitate them safely, as he has swallowed both Mort and Kowalski.\n\nHe's very fond of explosives, and his answer to problems would always be \"Kaboom!\", if Skipper did not keep him in line.\n\nRico has little tolerance for \"mushy\" stuff, and often becomes nauseous when Private gets overly emotional and \"lovey-dovey\" about something. On the other hand he seems to be the second most emotional penguin next to Private and is deeply in love with a doll called Ms. Perky. Another characteristic of Rico is that he might be incredibly superstitious, as, after receiving a rather dismal sounding fortune in a fortune cookie, Rico was a victim of pranks by King Julien who was trying to prove it was right. Even after revealing that Julien was behind the accidents, Rico still needed to have him \"take away the curse.\" He is also insanely skilled with knives and bladed objects, able to make sashimi or carve a Christmas tree from ice in a matter of seconds and destroy bowling pin dummies with a chainsaw while blindfolded.\n\nRico's psychosis needs to be controlled at all times, by Skipper limiting his use of destructive solutions, often involving explosions. Giving him free rein to destroy to his heart's desire, Rico builds up enough psychotic pressure that he becomes a vortex of destruction, spinning out of control and destroying everything in his path. Kowalski once estimated Rico was capable of destroying the entire zoo in this state.\n\nRico appears to have an outstanding opera voice when excited (as seen in episodes \"Go Fish\", \"Herring Impaired\", \"High Moltage\", \"Hair Apparent\", etc.).\n\nIn the episode \"Herring Impaired\", Rico shows that he can be responsible when his friends need help, and because the other penguins had \"Pisces Dementia\", Rico had to keep watch over his friends to make sure they don't have another fish for 24 hours. During the episode, Maurice asked that \"Since when did we get four Ricos?\" showing that Rico is actually known for his appetite for fish and insanity among the other animals.\n\n====Private====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Private\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Christopher Knights]] (films and video games)<br />[[James Patrick Stuart]] (''The Penguins of Madagascar'')\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nPrivate is the youngest and shortest of the penguins. He has light blue eyes and speaks with a [[United Kingdom|British]] accent (though the other penguins think his accent is fake).<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Hard Boiled Eggy|episodelink=List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep54|series=The Penguins of Madagascar|serieslink=The Penguins of Madagascar|network=[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]|airdate=June 19, 2010|season=2|number=6|minutes=8:17|quote=Kowalski: He's putting on an adorably phony British accent. Skipper: Just like the private. Private: Phony? This is how I really talk.}}</ref> Private has been known to be a rather curious penguin and is much nicer and down-to-earth than the others. In a way, he's much more childish, enjoying \"Lunacorns\" (pony dolls based on a show that teaches good morals and friendship) and often suggesting much nicer plans (such as asking for something instead of breaking into a habitat or simply telling the truth to others.) He is often called inexperienced by the others. He has an addiction to Peanut Butter Winkies, first displayed in \"Skorka\" and further elaborated on in later episodes.\n\nHe was overprotective of the egg in the episode \"Paternal Egg-Stinct\", though given how his team mates were treating it (Skipper put it through a dangerous obstacle course, Kowalski tried shock treatments to increase its intelligence, and Rico was flying it with a hang glider), this was rational. Private is very good at deciphering the code, communications and peace treaties, and in some degrees, common sense.\n\nPrivate has been known to give life lessons (in \"Mort Unbound\" he tells Mort, \"There is a natural order of things\" and in \"Two Feet High and Rising\" he tells Mort that Julien's feet \"are just feet; not love\"). Private is emotionally sensitive, and is often portrayed as more observant or down to earth than the others (noticing when Skipper's ankle tag had not been taken off, indicating that he did not get a shot or suggesting that Maurice had stumbled back because of being blinded by a camera flash, which Skipper quickly labeled as preposterous though he nevertheless told Kowalski to run a scenario) as well as having fighting skills on a par with or only slightly below those of Rico and Skipper (in one episode he is able to block rapid strikes from Skipper and disarm him with his feet while spinning on his head, all while blindfolded). On the wall of the Penguin's HQ is a stuffed fish with a sign \"Private's First Prize\"; hiding behind it (as well as a bunch of electronic precautions) is his most prized possession: a [[butterscotch]] lollipop. Like Kowalski, he loves candy, but eating too much of it causes him to hallucinate. He has an abnormal fear of badgers and cockroaches, as shown in the \"Badger Pride\" and \"Stop Bugging Me\" episodes respectively. When Private is the last available penguin to fix a situation (such as when it's revealed that the penguins had spied on the rest of the zoo occupants or during 'Untouchable'), he is able to rise to the occasion and execute a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nIn the episode \"Cute-Astrophe\", Private ended up developing a \"hyper-cute\" ability, wherein he achieves a state of over 132% adorability, that will make everyone around him pass out as they cannot cope with how absolutely cute he is. At first, Skipper abused the hyper-cute, using it on everyone around them, so Private swore to never use it again after the misuse of the hyper-cute caused chaos around the zoo and nearly got them sent away. Despite his vow, the hyper-cute made appearances in other episodes. This ability was attempted in one episode when Private was molting, but instead of knocking an observer out with adorability, it frightened and panicked anybody seeing him use the ability.\n\nIn the \"Concrete Jungle Survival\" episode, Private received the rank of [[Private First Class]] after successfully passing a test in the city. He had been just a [[Private (rank)|Private]] beforehand.\n\nIn the Christmas special \"Merry Madagascar\" Private finds himself falling in love with Cupid, one of Santa's reindeer. The relationship is short-lived, as Cupid must return and work with Santa. Private reminded her that they would \"Always have Madagascar!\" as she flew off.\n\nPrivate is the only penguin with known relatives, he has an uncle named Nigel (though they may not be related), and in \"Operation Penguin,\" he mentions his father is named Sam Fishy, though Sam Fishy has yet to be shown onscreen. However, in ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'', he appeared to have been abandoned as an egg, leading to the possibility that he is an [[orphan]].\n\n===The Lemurs===\n\n====King Julien XIII====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = King Julien XIII\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] (films)<br />[[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] (TV series and specials, video games, and ''Madagascar 3'' soundtrack)<br />[[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]] (first video game)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Ring-tailed lemur]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nKing Julien XIII is an Indian-accented conceited, selfish, fun-loving [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n\nAs a self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs, Julien ruled over a great colony of lemurs in Madagascar using mostly his charisma and [[Delegation|delegating]], i.e. telling other people what they should do since he certainly had very little ability to lead. Nevertheless, he shows more intelligence and calmness compared to the other lemurs (aside from Maurice), which is shown when the very word \"[[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]]\" drives all of them, except himself and Maurice, into a state of panic.\n\nHe had parties for his people on [[Madagascar]] with much frequency, the likes of which were interrupted constantly by the fossa, which trespassed onto the lemur territory, devouring all that they could catch.\n\nIn Julien's early life as seen in ''All Hail King Julien'', he was depicted as the nephew of King Julien XII, who banned all noisy things to keep the fossa from attacking. After Julien XII abdicated to evade a prophecy from being eaten by the Fossa, Julien XIII became the new King of the Lemurs and did things that were opposite his uncle's rules. He saves his people from the Fossa and got bitten on the butt by the Fossa and he survived. When he learns that his nephew is still alive and is still king, his devious uncle tries to get rid of him and reclaim the throne. When he returned, Uncle King Julien tricks Julien into going into the Fossa territory to find out what they're planning with Maurice joining him. In the end, Julien discovered his uncle's plot, glad that Clover chose him over his uncle, and gives his uncle a second chance, by putting him in the Fossa disguise, that is being cuddled by a Fossa girl, much to his uncle's dismay.\n\nThe day Alex and his friends came to Madagascar, King Julien and his subjects were enjoying one of their parties when it was invaded by the fossa. When the fossa were scared off by Alex, Julien and his people were hiding in the trees and saw this scene, thinking Alex and his friends were giants from some faraway land, with Julien coming forward and presenting himself as the king of the lemurs&nbsp;\u2014 once he had ascertained they were not dangerous by tempting them with Mort.\n\nWhen asked where the people were, Julien pointed to a skeleton of a man caught in a parachute hanging from a tree. Later that night, Julien had a meeting of the lemurs and other creatures of the jungle in the plane. Julien insisted that if they could make friends with Alex and his friends, the foossa would be scared away for good. Maurice was skeptical about this plan, but Julien insisted that, being king, his ideas were the best. Julien's plan failed when Alex started to get out of control and try to kill the lemurs and his friends. Although Alex then turned back to normal and the foossa were scared away with only the actions of the four main characters and the penguins, Julien took the credits for its success. However, when it went wrong, he did not foist the idea back onto Maurice.\n\nWhen Alex and his friends were ready to go back to New York, Julien gave them his crown; he had already made himself a bigger, better one using a leaf-tailed [[gecko]] named Stevie.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Julien, along with Maurice and Mort, accompany Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman to New York on the plane built by the penguins while leaving Stevie in charge until the day he returns. He is in the first class, ordering constant refreshments, and amusing himself with plane crash videos. As the plane crashes down to Africa after running out of fuel and momentum, Julien takes utter pleasure in the feeling of weightlessness caused by the high-speed descent. By being in first class, he escapes the crash with a parachute but loses his crown.\n\nUpon arriving in Africa, Julien at first believes they are in New York and makes himself a new crown. He manages to gain some power while in Africa, although very few characters actually pay attention to him, getting to ride a flock of [[flamingo]]s with Maurice, then moving on to riding [[ostriches]] and finally an elephant. Later, when the reserve's watering hole dries up, Julien suggests to the animals that they make a sacrifice to \"his good friends, the water gods\" at the volcano to replenish the water. To convince the masses, King Julien enacts his casual conversation with the Water Gods. Later, Julien persuades Melman to volunteer for the sacrifice, who believed he was going to die soon anyway. But when Melman realized he was going to live, he gave up on being a sacrifice, leaving Julien disappointed at his plan's failure. Mort arrives soon after, followed by a persistent shark that had been attempting to eat him. This shark then falls into the volcano, thus completing the sacrifice, and as Julien comes out of the volcano, he sees the water coming back to the reserve (due, in fact, to a dam constructed by Nana being destroyed by Alex and Zuba), and is convinced of his plan's success. From this King Julien concludes that the Water Gods like seafood more.\n\nJulien appears in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' regularly, often noisily and unintentionally annoying Skipper and pretty much everyone. He is the self-proclaimed \"King of the Zoo\" no doubt due to his former king status on Madagascar. Only Mort and Maurice truly believe and respect him as their king, the rest just show up to his \"proclamation of royal decrees.\" Julien is proven to be a worthy ally in most episodes, since it is he who sometimes saves the day for the penguins (like in \"[[The Penguins of Madagascar: Operation: DVD Premiere#Television special: \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\"|Dr. Blowhole's Revenge]]\"). Julien hates having anyone touch his feet, such as passing a royal decree that anyone who touches his feet would be banished from his kingdom (the zoo). When the sewer rats went to the zoo and tricked the Penguins out of their home, Julien decided to play for the Penguins in a game of Hockey to try and win their home back. They were losing until one of the rats touched his feet, after that he lost it and beat all of them on his own.\n\nIn the episode \"Crown Fools\", Julien panics when he loses his crown and obsessively longs for it until it is revealed that he had a spare crown all along (prompting Marlene, who was trying to make him new crowns all day, to chase him with a crowbar). Despite his desire for everyone to listen and do what he wants, he dislikes and ignores Mort, his most loyal follower, who treats him like a god. Mort responds to everything Julien tells him to do as \"I like...\" followed by whatever Julien said. In the episode \"Haunted Habitat\" he mentioned that he had a dream that he was \"The last mammal on Earth\". Mort was just happy to be in the dream despite that he was \"road kill\" in it.\n\nA recurring gag in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' series is that Julien believes in [[Spirit|supernatural beings]], which sometimes annoys the other animals. In the episode ''Misfortune Cookie'', Rico gets a fortune cookie that reads \"You will soon meet a fowl end.\" The penguins deny that fortune cookies have any power, despite receiving three accurate fortunes, and dismiss it as superstition. Julien exclaims \"these stitions are super,\" and tries to get the penguins to believe in the supernatural. King Julien actively plots to make a \"foul end\" fortune come true - by his own doing. It is also known that his believing in spirits can be used against him, seeing that Mason and Phil tricks Julien into believing that the \"sky spirits\" are angry with the Julien self-centrism, thing that change Julien's personality. But when Skipper notices that kind Julien is more annoying than the [[narcissist]] Julien, Skipper makes him come back to his original self.\n\nIt is also shown that Julien gains a super-lemur level of strength if he gets mad. Visible when in \"Miracle on Ice\", Julien spanked and humiliated the Rat King, after one of his henchmen touched Julien's feet; In Happy King Julien Day, Maurice claims that Julien violently used a cane to spank everyone who forgot his self-proclaimed holiday.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', he has a bigger role and falls in love with Sonya the Bear. Also, he saved the day by managing to get back to the circus.\n\n====Maurice====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Maurice\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Cedric the Entertainer]] (films and TV specials)<br />John Cothran, Jr. (first video game)<br />[[Fred Tatasciore]] (second and third video games)<br />[[Kevin Michael Richardson]] (television)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Aye-aye]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMaurice is an overweight [[aye-aye]], although he lacks the aye-aye's distinctive middle finger.\n\nMaurice is King Julien's advisor - although Julien seldom listens to him - and often shows skepticism of his ruler's mad plans. He has a long squirrel-like bushy tail. He lived in a tribe of other lemurs and witnessed newcomers to their home: a quartet of zoo animals. Maurice was suspicious of Alex, a lion, thinking him to be potentially dangerous. Maurice expressed this concern during a meeting of the lemurs and jungle animals, but was ignored by Julien. The next day, Maurice took part in the festival honoring the newcomers. During the festival, his suspicions about Alex become confirmed as Alex starts to give into his natural predatory instincts, and shortly after explained the trouble with having a lion around. He knew that Alex would need to eat meat, and felt that Alex should leave and go to the carnivore side of the island.\n\nShortly after, Maurice witnessed Gloria, Melman, and Marty working with a group of penguins to fight off the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] that were attacking the lemur tribe. Maurice had to admit that King Julien's plan had worked and that fossa would no longer be of any worry. Maurice saw the newcomers out when they decided to leave and was obligated to wave King Julien's arm for him, as the king was tired of waving it.\n\nIn the sequel ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', Maurice does not have a prominent role, basically agreeing to whatever King Julien says. In the series, he often acts like a strict big brother to Mort and knows him so well that in \"The Penguin Stays in the Picture\" he is shocked to find that Mort only ate half of his popsicle, prompting Skipper to go find him because he suspected Mort went missing, which was correct.\n\nHe is shown to have many hidden talents in several episodes such as painting and speaking chameleon in \"The Hidden\" and using a yo-yo in \"Friend-in-a-Box.\" In \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel,\" his desire to control an army of Julien man-servants is revealed. Despite being overweight, he was still able to hold his own when he got into a physical fight with Kowalski and Rico in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel.\" He has shown attraction to Darla the Baboon.\n\nMaurice returns with a much smaller role in ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,'' where he and the other two lemurs join the zoosters in catching up with the penguins and chimps. After joining the circus, the trio of lemurs fall into a crate holding Sonya the bear. Julien falls in love with Sonya, weirding-out Maurice and Mort. The two don't show up again until the end of the movie where they gun Dubois with a tranquilizer dart.\n\n====Mort====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Mort\n| series             = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice              = [[Andy Richter]] (most media) <br />[[Dee Bradley Baker]] (first video game)<br />[[Matt Nolan (American actor and singer)|Matt Nolan]] (second and third video games)\n| lbl21              = Species\n| data21             = [[Goodman's mouse lemur]]\n| first              = [[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]] (2005)\n| creator            = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\n\nThough quite timid, Mort can also be shrill and vocal in confrontations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Julien finds Mort incredibly annoying, and does not hesitate in proclaiming so. Despite this, Mort does not show any lasting unhappiness, and his expression changes within the same scene.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A running gag is that Mort commonly pukes. Mort has an [[foot fetish|obsession with Julien's feet]] ever since he used them to kick some fossa as seen in the first episode of ''[[All Hail King Julien]]''. Mort also has very good money skills as in the episode \"Gimme Gimme Gimme: The Game\" where he cleverly becomes the richest lemur in Madagascar (all the other lemurs became broke including Julien after getting all their money and possessions but gives it all back after Julien, defeated, says that he had won showing that he believed that it was all a game). In the episode \"Oh Captain, Muy Captain (Part 2)\", is revealed that Mort was a fearsome pirate named Dread Pirate Mort at some point. In every episode, Mort was able to develop different personalities such as Smart Mort and his Evil Grammy which resulted in his personality disorder. During the events of \"Exiled\", it is revealed that Mort is an immortal transdimentional being and all of his alternate personalities are dimensional counterparts who he defeated and absorbed their life essence. By the end of the season, he marries the mountain lemur Zora but later break up in Season 5.\n\nIn ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' episode \"Sting Operation\" when the penguins turn into idiots, they had the same obsession for feet just like him, which Julien despises. In his anger, Julien once banished Mort from their habitat at the zoo, forcing Mort to seek a \"cure\" from the Penguins.<ref name=\"Feet\"/>\n\nMort makes his first appearance in ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', wherein he has a minor role. He lives among the other native lemurs under Julien. Julien uses him as a test to see if Alex and the others eat lemurs, and Mort quickly decides that he likes them, as he is later shown to have a tendency to like everything. Later, Julien notes that if Alex does not like fish and still hungers for steak, Mort is \"Plan B\". Mort is last seen in the film with the other lemurs wishing the zoo animals farewell, and Julien uses him as a makeshift foot-rest.\n\nIn ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', Mort plays a much larger role. He attempts to follow Julien and Maurice on the penguins' plane, but Julien goes to extremes to keep him out of the plane, declaring that Mort had \"scissors and hand cream\" (he did in fact, have a pair of scissors, however he lacked any hand cream on the journey). {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Mort succeeds in attaching himself to the outside of the plane, where he is seen by Alex (parodying a scene of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''{{'}}s episode ''Nightmare at 20.000 feet''), before falling into the ocean shortly before it crashed. After reaching a shore at Africa, Mort is pursued by a persistent shark, which follows him onto the African preserve. Mort (still followed by the shark) finds Julien at a volcano where Melman had just decided that he would not sacrifice himself to return the preserve's water. The shark accidentally falls into the volcano just as Alex and Zuba destroy the dam blocking the river, thus leading Julien to believe that his plan to give a sacrifice to bring back the water was successful.\n\nMort makes appearances through ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'', along with Julien and Maurice. At one point, stuffed \"Mort\" dolls became very popular, and out of jealousy Julien throws them into the skunk habitat.<ref name=\"Plush\">{{cite episode| title = Operation: Plush and Cover | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = March 30, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 4}}</ref> Mort is accidentally shipped back to the factory with the dolls, and must be rescued. In the episode, King Julien also reveals that the only reason he allows Mort to stay with them is so he can express his dislike for Mort in front of him, and keep himself entertained.<ref name=\"Feet\"/> Mort is also shown to be unhappy with his past self after growing in size and muscle mass due to an invention from Kowalski. After being turned back into his regular self, Mort expresses that he is happy with who he is.<ref name=\"Unbound\">{{cite episode| title = Mort Unbound | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = June 26, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 21}}</ref> In the television series, whenever an animal or object is falling it almost always lands on Mort. Despite the fact that Mort is often treated poorly by King Julien, the other characters show concern for him as Maurice tries to (if with limited success) save Mort when he may be in danger to be King Julien's biggest concern, and Skipper, who refers to Mort as \"sad-eyes\", dived in the way of the mutant rat overlord to save Mort. In the episode \"Otter Woman\", all the boys are attracted to Marlene because her fur turned white. Mort tries the same thing in the end of the episode, without success.\n\nMort returned in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. Things he does in it involve vomiting on Alex's birthday cake, helping Alex defeat Dubois early on in the film, being part of the flying [[Afro]] Circus with the other lemurs, and tranquilizing Dubois with knockout darts.\n\n===Mason and Phil===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Mason and Phil\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Conrad Vernon]] (Mason)<br />(Phil is an unvoiced character)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Common chimpanzee|Chimpanzee]]s\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005)\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Mark Burton]]<br>[[Billy Frolick]]<br>[[Eric Darnell]]<br>[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]\n}}\n\nMason and Phil are two sophisticated [[common chimpanzee]]s at the Central Park Zoo, who prefer to drink cups of [[coffee]] and \"read\" the newspaper in the morning. Mason speaks with a [[Received Pronunciation|stereotypical British accent]]; Phil, by contrast, doesn't speak at all and communicates entirely through [[American Sign Language]], though whether he is actually deaf is unknown. While Mason is unable to read, Phil can and is used to decipher writing while Mason translates the ASL. Both escape the zoo after Gloria breaks through its outer wall; Mason mentions [[Tom Wolfe]] giving a lecture, and they plan to attend to \"throw poo at him.\"<ref name=\"throw\">{{cite video |date=November 15, 2005 |title=Madagascar |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/ |medium=DVD |publisher=DreamWorks |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |quote=\"I heard Tom Wolfe is speaking at Lincoln Center.\" / \"Well of course we're going to throw poo at him!\"}}</ref> Along with other characters, Phil and Mason are captured and sent to a wildlife reserve.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} However, their crates are not thrown off the boat, and they are not seen until a final scene, in which they are still in crates waving farewell to the Madagascar natives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', the chimps call upon chimpanzees living in Africa to help rebuild the wrecked plane that was supposed to fly them back to New York.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} They later go on strike, asking for [[maternity leave]]s and breaks (Skipper argues that they are all males); eventually, they [[blackmail]] Skipper into agreeing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', Mason and Phil are supporting characters in the series, and are shown to be annoyed by Julien's partying. They attempt to rid him of his ways by tricking Julien into thinking a solar eclipse was a sign that the \"sky spirits\" disapproved of his behavior.<ref name=\"Eclipse\">{{cite episode| title = Eclipsed | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = June 6, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 20}}</ref> They also frequently mention throwing poo and are used to read the English language. Phil may be the most temperamental or \"potty mouthed\" of the two, as after being told there is no checkmate in checkers, he makes several signs which Mason responds with \"You groom your mother with those hands?!\" Phil and Mason may also sometimes lose things in the translation of what they are made to read. An instance of this is when the zoo occupants were ordered to make a cake for King Julien, and Mason mistakes \"booger\" for \"sugar\". This does not mean that Phil is unable to communicate well, even though he is unable to truly speak, he was still able to win over the heart of Lulu, a female chimp visiting from the Hoboken Zoo in New Jersey for a weekend, While Lulu did appear in a later episode where the penguins ended up accidentally finding themselves in the Hoboken Zoo, it is unknown if she keeps in touch with Phil.\n\nMcGrath explained that originally their \"first scene was just deciphering the code on the shipping label\".<ref name=\"background\" /> The crew \"got this girl who knew American Sign Language\" to give them hand gestures. They wanted gestures to be \"really frenetic\", and \"she signed out, 'Tell the tiny pea-brained birds that the sign reads: Ship to...{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"background\" /> Afterward, the crew returned to the scene where Mason notes Tom Wolfe's lecture, and she signed \"Can we throw our poo at his stupid white suit?\"<ref name=\"background\" /> Mason is named after legendary British actor [[James Mason]], whose urbane, sophisticated vocal styling is mimicked by Vernon.\n\nIn ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'' Mason and Phil have smaller roles and are mostly seen posing as the King of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].\n\nThey make a cameo appearance on a newspaper in ''[[Turbo (film)|Turbo]]''.\n\n===Circus Zaragoza Animals===\nThe animals of Circus Zaragoza are trained circus performers that Alex's group had met while on the run from Chantel DuBois. Among the animals of Circus Zaragoza are:\n\n====Vitaly====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Vitaly\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Bryan Cranston]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Siberian tiger]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nVitaly is a muscular [[Siberian tiger]] with a Russian accent who leads a traveling circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.\n\nThe tough Vitaly once jumped through flaming rings of fire to excite crowds, constantly pushing himself to the limit by jumping through smaller and smaller rings that seemed impossible for his size while lubricating himself with olive oil. But after losing his confidence and more than a few of his hairs on one fateful attempt which involved a flaming ring that would only fit on the smallest finger (due to the olive oil being flammable), he also lost his passion and his act partially. When Alex and his friends plead with the circus to let them escape on their train, Vitaly is the most resistant, only to be overruled by Gia. When the zoo animals purchase the circus, Vitaly remains the most hostile to their changes to the business, even as the rest of the crew becomes inspired.\n\nIn London, Vitaly decides to give up and prepares to leave just before the circus' critical performance. Alex confronts Vitaly and reminds the tiger of his love of performing and while suggesting he uses [[hair conditioner]] as a safer lubricant before regaining his courage to jump through the tiny flaming [[wikt:hoop|hoop]]. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly to open the successful show. With that, a profoundly heartened Vitaly becomes a fast friend of Alex. Even after the zoo animals are exposed and estranged from the circus, Vitaly is the first to support Gia's proposal to rescue their new friends from the zoo and plays a key role in that operation.\n\n====Gia====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Gia\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Jessica Chastain]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Jaguar]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n| nationality = Italian\n}}\nGia is a [[jaguar]] with an Italian accent who is part of the traveling circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.

She is Alex's love interest who is always on the lookout to discover something new and gets her chance when she convinces a reluctant Alex to teach her the trapeze \u2013 \"Circus Americano\" style. Her only role in the circus before Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria came around was doing normal cat tricks (sitting, standing, rolling over), but when Alex teaches her trapeze, she performs with him and they move closer. Later on, she and the other circus animals save Alex and the gang from Dubois.\n\n====Stefano====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Stefano\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Martin Short]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[sea lion]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n| nationality = Italian\n}}\nStefano is a [[sea lion]] with an Italian accent and curly whiskers.

A true entertainer at heart, he is up for any challenge to save the circus, even convincing Alex that the show must go on.\n\n====Sonya====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Sonya\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Frank Welker]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Eurasian brown bear]]\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nSonya is the traveling circus' most ferocious [[Eurasian brown bear]] who appears in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. Her tricycle riding act is only topped by her ridiculous [[tutu (clothing)|tutu]]. But her biggest trick of all will be casting a spell on King Julien, who is instantly smitten with her. She does not talk nor is anthropomorphic like most of the other characters, but Julien can understand what she is saying when she growls (the way she communicates instead).\n\nWhile they are in [[Rome]], she and Julien travel to [[Vatican City]] where they steal the [[Pope]]'s ring after Julien pretends to kiss it and uses it to buy her a [[Ducati]] motorbike after they fall down a set of stairs and destroy her tricycle, which she uses in her performance in [[London]].\n\n====The Andalusian Triplets====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = The Andalusian Triplets<br />Esperanza, Esmeralda and Ernestina\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Paz Vega]]\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Andalusian horse]]s\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nEsperanza, Esmeralda, and Ernestina (voiced by [[Paz Vega]]) are three of the new characters in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. They are [[White (horse)|white]] [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian Mares]] who like Marty and are part of the circus. All their names start with \"E\" and end with \"A\". When Alex's group improved the Circus Zaragoza, the Andalusian Triplets bounced on the trampolines during their act while wearing butterfly wings on their outfits.\n\nThey were listed as \"Horses\" in the credits.\n\n====The Dancing Dogs====\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = The Dancing Dogs<br />Frankie, Freddie, Jonesy and Shakey\n| series      = [[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]\n| voice       = [[Nick Fletcher]] (Frankie)<br />[[Vinnie Jones]] (Freddie)<br />[[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] (Jonesy)<br />[[Jules de Jongh]] (Shakey)\n| lbl21       = Species\n| data21      = [[Entlebucher Mountain Dog]] (Frankie)<br />[[Great Dane]] (Freddie)<br />[[Bernese Mountain Dog]] (Jonesy and Shakey)<br />[[Beagle]] (Bobby)<br />[[Dachshund]] (Sammy)\n| first       = ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012)\n| last        =\n}}\nThe Dancing Dogs are a group of six performing [[dog]]s with British accents as members of the circus in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''. They tend to fight and argue with each other and they hate being called cute and cuddly. The Dancing Dogs consist of Frankie the [[Entlebucher Mountain Dog]] (voiced by [[Nick Fletcher]]), Freddie the [[Great Dane]] (voiced by [[Vinnie Jones]]), Jonesy the [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] (voiced by [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]), Shakey the Brown [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] (voiced by [[Jules de Jongh]]), Bobby the [[Beagle]], and Sammy the [[Dachshund]]. Only the first three are credited.\n\n====Manu and Maya====\nManu and Maya are two performing [[Indian elephant]]s as members of Circus Zaragoza in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.\n\nTheir names are revealed in the DVD commentary as well as the fact that they are German. According to Tom McGrath, they are very nice and great to work with. They remain silent in the film due to the fact that their possible dialogue was cut from the film.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Ted===\nTed (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) is a [[polar bear]] who lives in the Central Park Zoo. He first appeared in \"[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]\" where he was sad due to be alone during Christmas. This caused Private to want to give him a present. When Skipper denied him his request, Private snuck out into the city to find Ted a gift only to be kidnapped by Nana. After getting Private back, the other penguins decided to invite Ted to their Christmas party where the polar bear had invited the rest of the Zoo as the animals present sing their rendition of \"Jingle Bells.\"\n\nHe made a brief background cameo in the first movie.\n\nIn the series, he mainly appears as a background zoo animal. He did play a small role in the episode \"P.E.L.T.\" when Skipper had to provoke and evade a polar predator.\n\n===Zuba===\nZuba (voiced by [[Bernie Mac]] in the film, Dan White in the video game) is a [[lion]] who is Alex's father and the alpha lion of the pride in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''.\n\nHe was first seen as the Alpha Lion of a pride in the reserve where Alex was born. At first, he thinks that Alex has returned to take over, but his wife notices that they both have the same birthmark and realizes that Alex is their son. Zuba is a proud father, but he is somewhat confused as to why his son is interested in [[dancing]]. After many events in the movie including Alex failing the rite of passage and shaming his family, Zuba finally accepts Alex. The film was dedicated to Mac's memory.\n\n===Florrie===\nFlorrie (voiced by [[Sherri Shepherd]]) is Alex's mother, Zuba's wife, and the alpha [[lion]]ess of the pride in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''. Florrie, unlike Zuba, accepts Alex for what he is. She is not disturbed at all by the fact that Alex prefers to dance instead of fight. Due to this, she acts as the voice of reason and tries to encourage Zuba that it is better that Alex came back to them, dancer or not, as a king. Florrie is never addressed by her name in the film and in the movie's end credits, she is credited as \"Mom\". It is presumably in the novelization that her name is revealed.\n\n===Moto Moto===\nMoto Moto (voiced by [[will.i.am]] in the film, [[Greg Eagles]] in the video game) is a chunky, handsome and muscular [[hippopotamus]] with an attractive deep voice, who is very attracted to 'big and chunky' females. In ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', he courts and romantically pursues Gloria. However, eventually, Gloria realizes that Moto Moto only loves her because of her large body, and Gloria breaks up with him as a result, though they remain friends.\nMoto Moto is mentioned to mean \"Hot Hot\" in Swahili. He has also become an [[internet meme]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTTAq_JOUjk</ref>\n\n===Okapi Girl===\nAn unnamed female [[Okapi]] (voiced by [[Taraji P. Henson]]) appears in ''[[Madly Madagascar]]'', whom Marty finds himself in love with. She is not interested until he uses a love potion on himself, causing her and all the other female animals to begin pampering him. She and the other animals lose interest in him after he jumps into a lake to hide from them (due to becoming overwhelmed by the pampering), causing the potion to wash off.\n\n===North Wind===\nNorth Wind is an [[Arctic]] elite undercover interspecies task force that is dedicated to helping animals that can't help themselves. They worked with the Penguins in order to thwart the plans of the villain Dave (aka Dr. Octavius Brine). Among the members of North Wind are:\n\n====Classified====\nClassified (voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) is a courageous yet slightly arrogant British [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]] and the [[Leadership|team leader]] of North Wind.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> He is at loggerheads with Skipper. Skipper calls him Classified, who states his name isn't really \"Classified\". His name is classified (as in \"top secret\") because he is the leader of the team. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Skipper.\n\n====Short Fuse====\nShort Fuse (voiced by [[Ken Jeong]]) is a Belgian [[harp seal]]. He is the North Wind's explosive and demolitions expert. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Rico.\n\n====Eva====\nEva (voiced by [[Annet Mahendru]]) is a Russian [[snowy owl]] and North Wind's intelligence analyst. Kowalski has a crush on her. She is the North Wind's counterpart of Kowalski.\n\n====Corporal====\nCorporal (voiced by [[Peter Stormare]]) is a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and the muscle of the North Wind team. He seems to like penguins and he freaks out when other penguins are taken. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Private (loosely, as he's also able to fight well, but shows affection at a great level, like Private.)\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===Nana===\nNana (voiced by [[Elisa Gabrielli]] in the films, [[Marion Ross]] in the second video game) is an elderly lady with a Yiddish accent and the [[archenemy]] of Alex the lion.\n\nNana's personality changes over her appearances. Initially, she appears as a very aggressive old lady with incredible martial arts skills. In ''The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper'', she is shown to be aggressive with anyone, no matter how courteous people are with her. But in ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'', she appears to be kinder than before, even leading the New Yorkers when she notices that they are in panic, only being aggressive with wild animals; which she sees as no different from domestic animals. She is also shown to be a soft and grandmotherly figure to the New Yorkers. For example, when a man helps her find her handbag, she says, \"Such a good boy. Nana can't survive without it.\"\n\nNana seems to be incredibly resistant to injury, as she was able to have another fight with Alex right after being tugged out of the back of a speeding tour jeep as well as being thrown through the windshield a second time by the penguins, who reversed over her in the jeep after noticing that she did not die. Despite her martial arts skills, she is still portrayed as a \"little old lady\"; she has a waddling gait, wears dentures, and is knocked onto her back when firing a gun.\n\nIn the first movie, Nana crosses paths with Alex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], then brutally assaults him. Throughout the series, she refers to Alex as \"the bad kitty.\" She also hits Melman with her hand bag, causing his head to get stuck in the Grand Central Station Clock. When the animals are surrounded by police, she somehow gets past and kicks Alex in \"the batteries\" (or his groin). She was quickly taken away by police. As shown in the sequel, she was not arrested, she was interviewed as a witness, and states what she thought of Alex: \"He was a very bad kitty.\"\n\nNana is featured in ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]'', where she proves that there are times when she is shown to be not only aggressive with animals, but with also people, like when she destroys random merchandise at a kiosk while shopping for her dog, then demands to purchase Private in a very rude tone, when she refuses to pay the taxi driver her fare, when she tells her doorman to \"buzz off\" and then punches him in the face for no reason, and even when she does not hold the elevator for Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico.\n\nNana returns in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''. She also becomes the leader of an army of tourists left stranded by the penguins' schemes. She again crosses paths with Alex, then fights him, and wins again, although Alex puts up much more of a fight this time (although Alex confesses to his friends that he actually only did it to distract her to get her bag, making Nana's victory unofficial). She often hits Alex and loves her handbag. At the end of the film, Alex gives Makunga Nana's handbag. When she sees Makunga holding it, she kicks him in the groin, steps on his foot, whacks his hand with a ruler, digs her hand into his ear, arm-burns him, and spanks him before dragging him off the reserve by his ear. According to the DVD commentary, she took Makunga back to New York with her in a kitty cage.\n\nNana's assault on Alex at Grand Central Station is mentioned by a taxi driver in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' episode \"Zoo Tube\".\n\nNana does not appear in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]''.\n\n====Mr. Chew====\nMr. Chew (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a small, white [[poodle]], fond of chewing and tearing various items apart (as demonstrated on an Alex plush toy). Chew is owned by Nana, and lives in her apartment on the top floor in an apartment complex. Nana purchased Private, mistaking him for a [[squeaky toy]], while he was attempting to find a gift for Ted, and reveals him to be a Christmas present for Mr. Chew. Chew nearly mauled Private, while Nana was watching a football game on TV, but was defeated by Skipper, Kowalski and Rico, who had set out to rescue Private. Nana does not hear the fight, but after she sees the damage (following hearing Rico's dynamite stick going off), she blames Mr. Chew for destroying her apartment and puts him on a big \"time out\".\n\nMr. Chew had a cameo appearance in ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' when an identical poodle was seen as a head trophy owned by Captain Chantel DuBois.\n\n===The Fossa===\nThe [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (voiced by [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] and [[Eric Darnell]] in the film, various voices in ''[[All Hail King Julien]]'') appear as medium-sized weasel-like creatures, closely related to mongoose, and rarely speak, instead usually growling and yelping.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThroughout ''Madagascar'', they are shown to terrorize the lemurs and attempt to eat them. According to Julien, \"they're always annoying us [the lemurs] by trespassing, interrupting our parties, and ripping our limbs off.\"<ref name=\"limb\">{{cite video |date=November 15, 2005 |title=Madagascar |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/ |medium=DVD |publisher=DreamWorks |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |quote=They're always annoying us by trespassing, interrupting our parties, and ripping our limbs off.}}</ref> The fossa are fearful of Alex, and run away when they suspect an attack from him, as well as allow him to take their prey.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The fossa are defeated by Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, and the penguins and driven into their territory.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" episode \"The Terror of Madagascar,\" a baby Fossa (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) was shipped to the Central Park Zoo as part of a zoo-to-zoo tour. Throughout the episode, the baby fossa kept biting King Julien. Because of this, he thought that the fossa was trying to eat him. Kowalski told him that this was the fossa's way of showing love towards Julien, since he thought of him as his father. But, Julien realized this too late, because in order to get rid of the fossa, he shipped in a [[boa constrictor]] named Savio to devour him. In order to keep the fossa safe, Julien wanted Savio to eat him instead, but the fossa attacked Savio to protect Julien, much to the penguins' disappointment.\n\nThe Fossa are recurring characters in ''All Hail King Julien''. During his reign, King Julien's uncle King Julien XII had kept the lemur kingdom quiet in order to keep the Fossa from attacking them. His uncle gives Julien the crown after learning that the king of the lemurs will be eaten by the Fossa. But Julien got bitten on the butt, while saving the lemurs and his scream sent boulders falling down and the Fossa run away. Throughout the first movie and the two TV series, there have been male Fossa. In the fifth episode of ''All Hail King Julien'' there is a Fossa girl who flirts with Julien and Maurice in a Fossa suit. She is seen in the end cuddling the suit with Julien's uncle in it who is being punished and sparred by Julien, for sending his nephew to the territory and trying to reclaim the throne. Julien is, at one point, able to tame a Fossa girl named Mary Anne who later becomes a partial leader of the Fossa.\n\n===Makunga===\nMakunga (voiced by [[Alec Baldwin]] in the film, [[John Cygan]] in the video game) is a male [[lion]] with a large black mane styled in a pompadour and green eyes. He is Zuba's rival and wants to take his place as alpha lion. He also calls Alex pathetic. When asked why he wants to become alpha lion, he replies \"I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart, and I want everyone else to do what I say\" Makunga usually acts like he thinks he is smart and has good leadership, but he only is trying to become alpha lion because he wants to be in charge. Makunga often looks at other characters while making an evil unnoticed face where he crosses his arms in front of his chest and makes a big [[smirk]], usually when he is planning to do something that is not good (in this manner, he is very similar to [[List of The Lion King characters|Scar]] from ''[[The Lion King]]\").\n\nHis name sounds a little to \"Wakunga\", (singular: \"Mkunga\") which means \"midwives\" in Swahili.\n\nMakunga often challenged Zuba to fights over the alpha lion position, but was easily beaten. One of those fights led to Zuba being distracted while Alex was captured by poachers. Years later, Makunga used Alex in a bid to finally reach the rank of alpha lion where he tricked Alex into challenging his henchman Teetsi. When Alex was defeated, Zuba reluctantly had to give up his alpha lion status and go into exile with his family. Makunga is not a very good leader saying the only solution to the fact that the local water hole was nearly dry was that they all would have to fight for it. This causes doubt about his role as alpha lion, and almost every animal on the reserve wants Zuba back. After the water was restored, he still refused to allow Zuba and Alex to return from banishment.\nHe eventually meets his downfall when being tricked into angering Nana, who attacks Makunga and drags him off the reserve by his ear. The DVD commentary reveals that \"Nana brought Makunga to New York in a kitty cage\".\n\n====Teetsi====\nTeetsi (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) is Makunga's henchman and the strongest lion in his group. Makunga tricked Alex by suggesting that he goes up against Teetsi. Alex ended up defeated by Teetsi.\n\n===Captain Chantel DuBois===\nCaptain Chantel DuBois (voiced by [[Frances McDormand]]) is a [[Principality of Monaco|Monegasque]] [[animal control officer]]. She is the best [[animal control officer]] in [[Monte Carlo]] with a perfect success record. She is a big-game hunter and has extraordinary tracking skills, as well as superhuman strength and a habit of mounting the heads of every animal she has caught on her wall. Like Nana, she is incredibly resistant to injury. Throughout the third film, she pursues the Four in hopes of having their heads as trophies, especially Alex's. The obstacles DuBois avoid during her and her team's chase behind the animals' [[SUV]] in Monte Carlo are sliding past some omega-3 fish being spilled on the road while carrying her scooter up high, driving from one building to the other [in slow motion] after jumping off her scooter (where the animals are preparing to get on the plane), and doing some stunts in an office building.\n\nShe finally captured Alex and the other animals at [[New York City]], and the zoo staff thank her incorrectly believing that she tried to return Alex. She rips up the check they give her where she says that \"It wasn't about the money. It was about the lion.\" Alex is caged and DuBois hides a poison filled dart in a foam finger and shoots it at him, but the circus animals, being alerted by King Julien, arrive and rescue him. After a long fight between the animals and DuBois and her henchmen, DuBois is tranquilized by Mort and her men are knocked out. She and her men are last seen shipped to Madagascar with her henchmen (similar to the first movie) thanks to the Penguins.\n\n====DuBois' Men====\nDuBois' Men are four men of Captain DuBois' animal control officers. They are prone to getting hurt, unlike their boss. However, even when they ''do'' get hurt, DuBois can heal them instantly simply by singing \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]],\" thereby appealing to their patriotism. One is short, one is tall and skinny with a mustache (on an extra released on the DVD reveals his name is Gerard), one is overweight with a goatee and sideburns, and one is also overweight and has a mustache.\n\n===Dave / Dr. Octavius Brine===\nDave (voiced by [[John Malkovich]]) is a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who appears in [[Penguins of Madagascar]] as the main antagonist. He disguises himself as a human professor under the alias of Dr. Octavius Brine. Dave used to be one of the top attractions at the Central Park Zoo, in which time he entertained children with his clever and funny tricks. However, when Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private arrived, they unknowingly stole all his glory due to their cuteness and he was forcibly removed from his home. Afterwards, Dave was shipped to every major Zoo in the world, but the same thing happened again and again and again: penguins getting all the attention while Dave was shunned, ignored and neglected. Embittered, Dave now seeks revenge on the penguin species, becoming a [[mad scientist]] in the process.\n\nInside his submarine lair, Dave creates the [[Medusa]] serum, a green substance that when fired in a ray will transform its target into a physically and mentally disfigured monster. He plans to use it on all the penguins that stole his fame and then unleash the now monstrous penguins on New York city, so that the humans will despise them instead of love them. However, a group of Arctic animals called the \"North Wind\" attempt to foil his plans.\n\nAt the end of the film, Dave's plan for revenge is foiled and the vengeful octopus is shrunk by his own ray (the effects having been reversed by Private) and gets trapped in a snow globe, where he is admired by a little girl.\n\n====Dave's Henchmen====\nDave's Henchmen are octopuses. They are evil minions who work for Dave and assist him in his plans to rid of all penguins. They don't speak, but they make a bubbling sound that Dave understands. Each henchman share the first names of famous celebrities. Whenever Dave ordered them to do something, he would say the actor's first name and an action word that spells out the actors' full names (Ex. \"[[Nicolas Cage|Nicolas, cage]] them.\" \"[[Elijah Wood|Elijah, would]] you please take them away?\" \"[[Halle Berry|Halle, bury]] them.\"). About three of these underlings are named after the actors.\n\n==Characters in ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' TV series==\n\n===Marlene===\nMarlene (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]] in normal form, [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in wild form) is the Central Park Zoo's only resident [[Oriental small-clawed otter]] with primarily brown fur, with a white chest, face, and right foot. Marlene is shown to be both playful<ref name=\"Crown\">{{cite episode| title = Crown Fools | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 9, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 11}}</ref> and kind towards others, which often conflicts with Skipper's serious and safety-cautious attitude.<ref name=\"Hidden\">{{cite episode| title = The Hidden | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 18, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 12}}</ref> Though this is true, the two still share a very strong friendship with one another and still have the ability to keep that certain bond exceedingly strong, making it rather difficult to break. She attempts to find and bring out the best in others through kindness, though is not immune to feeling anger towards Rhonda, a rude walrus apathetic to others, and works to have her transferred (she regrets the decision after learning Rhonda would be sent to a polar bear reserve, and works doggedly to send her elsewhere).<ref name=\"Popcorn\" /> Despite having doubts on the penguins' ways of dealing with issues, Marlene still believes that they can accomplish very difficult tasks.<ref name=\"Feet\">{{cite episode| title = Two Feet High and Rising | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 7, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 9}}</ref> Marlene is known to snore very loudly while asleep, which invokes fear in an alligator named Roger residing in the sewer system beneath her enclosure.<ref name=\"Haunted\">{{cite episode| title = Haunted Habitat | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = March 28, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> Like other residents at the zoo, Marlene is shown to love both popcorn<ref name=\"Popcorn\">{{cite episode| title = Popcorn Panic | episodelink = List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep16 | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = May 9, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 16}}</ref> and candy. In order to get candy, she is bribed by Maurice to celebrate King Julien Day and participate in several tasks to keep Julien content.<ref name=\"JulienDay\">{{cite episode| title = Happy King Julien Day | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = March 31, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 5}}</ref> Marlene has also revealed that she won the Internet popularity contest at her past zoo three years in a row (though was unable to compete at the Central Park Zoo due to a scandal)<ref name=\"Tangled\">{{cite episode| title = Tangled in the Web | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 8, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 10}}</ref> and that she considers [[Christmas in July]] \"the biggest holiday of the year\".<ref name=\"JulienDay\"/>\n\nIn \"Otter Gone Wild\", it is revealed that she was born in captivity. When she sets foot in the outside world, she becomes wild. In her primal state, she briefly becomes [[infatuated]] with King Julien, and is capable of posing a significant threat even to the equally-psychotic Rico in a fight, later successfully defeating two enraged badgers who had just given the entire penguin team significant trouble.\n\nIn \"Otter Things Have Happened\", the penguins invented a machine that is able to locate anyone's ideal match at a moment's notice; the birds misread the signal her saliva sample gave and present her with Fred the squirrel, upsetting Julien who kidnaps the little guy (who Marlene has actually started to like). When she realizes Fred is not good for her, she dumps Fred and goes back to her single lifestyle. Kowalski, upset that his invention is faulty, throws it out. In the trash the machine begins to show the results of Marlene's test again; we see Fred in the area it was picking up, but then are treated to the introduction of a brand new character, Antonio or the \"Otter Bachelor of Central Park\", a buff, Latino male otter who has a fancy to frequently playing his Spanish guitar. It is not finalized, but it seems that Antonio was the individual who Marlene's test picked up, not Fred. It is not known yet if the penguins know of Antonio's existence or if Marlene will get to meet him in future episodes but in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel\" it is shown that Marlene dreams of being in a spacious room surrounded by many otters very similar (if not exactly like) Antonio all playing Spanish Guitars.\n\nIn \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\", it is shown that she believes Dr. Blowhole is not real. In \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole,\" she saw that he was real, though made no comment concerning any prior disbelief.\n\nDuring \"The Otter Woman\", an over-chlorinated pool resulted in Marlene's fur being bleached white, causing her to be mistaken for an [[arctic mink]] called \"Arlene,\" resulting in Skipper and Julien becoming infatuated with her before Skipper became convinced that \"Arlene\" had done something horrible to the seemingly missing Marlene. Later, Marlene's fur was dyed back to its original color by Alice when she noticed what happened to Marlene.\n\nIn \"Littlefoot,\" Marlene was separated from her feral self thanks to Kowalski's latest invention, but the separation resulted in her monstrous alter-ego going on the rampage while 'regular' Marlene was now excessively paranoid and afraid of everything around her. Despite Officer X capturing Marlene's feral self and taking her to animal control after feral Marlene went on a rampage that destroyed most of New York- earning the name 'Littlefoot' in the process-, the penguins managed to recombine Marlene's two selves, making Officer X lose his job again, and the experience of confronting her other self allowing Marlene to gain greater control over her feral side.\n\nIn \"Badger Pride,\" Marlene had to put up with the attacks from Becky and Stacy Badger (who are prone to having to put up with badger stereotypes) and her wild side comes in handy when it came to subduing them.\n\n===Alice===\nAlice (voiced by [[Mary Scheer]]) is a [[zookeeper]] exclusive to ''The Penguins of Madagascar''. She seems to dislike aspects of her job, and is happy to have a voice-automated robot guide give directions so she can avoid \"annoying tour group questions\".<ref name=\"Choked\">{{cite episode| title = All Choked Up | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = April 24, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 14}}</ref> She also does not understand what people enjoy about watching animals on their computer, saying that they do not do anything interesting.<ref name=\"Tangled\"/> Alice is involved in several aspects of the animal's well-being. It's hinted that deep down Alice cares for the zoo animals and only wants what's best for them as she hates it when people feed the animals popcorn, and posts several signs throughout the zoo after catching a child feeding Marlene a kernel. Though this could just be herself keeping her job safe.<ref name=\"Popcorn\"/> Alice is also in charge of gathering the penguins for visits to the veterinarian, and later remarks that they have a dentist appointment (Private then confusedly states that they do not have teeth).<ref name=\"Needle\">{{cite episode| title = Needle Point | series = The Penguins of Madagascar | serieslink = The Penguins of Madagascar | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = June 6, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 19}}</ref> Alice and the penguins have a mutual dislike for each other,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and she believes that they are scheming (though she is actually correct in this assumption).<ref name=\"Popcorn\"/> Though another zookeeper can be heard over her walkie-talkie, voiced by John DiMaggio, Alice is usually the only one ever seen on-screen but occasionally an unnamed zoo worker appears sporadically, though his face is always hidden.<ref name=\"Tangled\"/> Unintentionally, Alice won the zoo's internet popularity contest when a camera documenting the animals was accidentally pushed toward her dancing and slapping her [[Buttocks|butt]] in the kitchen.<ref name=\"Tangled\"/> In \"Miss Understanding\", she remarked to a know-it-all kid that the zoo had three male penguins and one female, which turned out to be false (not that she knew or cared, either of which could be true).\n\n===Pervis McSlade===\nPervis McSlade (voiced by [[Gary Cole]]) is the zoo commissioner of the Central Park Zoo.\n\nPervis McSlade first appeared in \"In The Line of Doody.\" He is the commissioner for the Central Park Zoo. He was making an appearance to announce the opening of the Children's Zoo. Skipper saved him from being hit by a pigeon named Frankie.\n\nHe later appears in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" to make Frances Alberta the new zookeeper of Central Park. When he finds out Frances was building bio mechanical androids to replace the animals with, he fired her.\n\n===Zoo Doctor===\nThis unnamed [[Physician|doctor]] (voiced by [[Brian George]] in an Asian-Indian accent) works as a [[veterinary physician|veterinarian]] at the Central Park Zoo. He works in the \"animal care\" building. Unlike Alice, he seems to be quite fond of animals. He is bald and wears a white lab coat. Skipper often voices dislike of him because of his use of needles and when injured, he has been known to try and downplay the injury rather than visit the vet.\n\n===Chuck Charles===\nChuck Charles (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[News presenter|newsman]] who works at Channel-1.\n\nIn \"The All Nighter Before Christmas,\" he mentions that he is so used to talking on television that he has forgotten how to talk normally.\n\nDue to an unknown reason in \"Goodnight and Good Chuck,\" he was fired and replaced with his rival anchor Pete Peters and he got a new job at the zoo as Alice's assistant. But he was sat on by Burt, swung out of control by Bada and Bing, tried to get a chameleon off of his face, being dragged away by a vehicle that drove itself, almost got flushed down a toilet, jumped on by Mort, and got sprayed by the amnesia spray by the Penguins. He tried to get his old job back by exposing the Penguins' operation to the world and he got past Rico, Private and Kowalski. The disc was taken by Pete Peters and Peters aired it. But when the world thought the Penguins' operation was fake, Pete Peters was fired and Chuck Charles was reinstated.\n\n===Rat King===\nThe Rat King (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) is a genetically enhanced, muscular [[Laboratory rat|lab rat]] who resides in the sewer. He constantly torments the penguins and never learns his lesson when he's defeated each time. He even tries to take over their home in a hockey game, but he is defeated by King Julien after Rat King's fellow rats skated over King Julien's feet. Also he is matched power with Skipper.\n\n====Sewer Rats====\nCountless small sewer rats who are friends and minions of Rat King. They are voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n===Officer X===\nOfficer X (voiced by [[Cedric Yarbrough]]) is a New York [[animal control officer]] who has a single-minded focus on removing stray animals from the streets. Officer X is shown to have a [[superhuman]] level of strength, crushing a small metal cage with his bare hands and defeating Joey, who even the penguins could not easily beat, head on, leading Skipper to say Officer X cannot be human.\n\nHe first tangles with the penguins when they interfere with his pursuit of a stray cat, the penguins' friend Max, in the episode \"Cat's Cradle\". When asked by Alice what his real name was, X responds that his mother never told him his real name, instead telling him that it was \"classified.\" Officer X was defeated by a Red Rhodesian Slasher that was painted to look like Max.\n\nX returns in the episode \"What Goes Around\" when he tries to capture the penguins when they are found out of the zoo on the streets of New York, but the subsequent chase results in X losing his job due to the scale of the damage he had caused and the public's lack of belief that penguins were responsible for his actions. He was arrested on vandalism charges creating the mess resulting from his and the penguins' encounter.\n\nHe returns as an exterminator in \"Stop Bugging Me,\" having been forced to work as an [[Pest control|exterminator]] after his previous rampage. He fights with the penguins who are protecting three cockroaches that Rico befriended. X was ready to enact his revenge, only for Private to cause the cockroaches to crawl into his suit causing him to run off. He also lost his mustache in this episode.\n\nIn \"The Officer X Factor,\" he replaces Alice for the weekend when she was sent on a vacation. As a zookeeper, he knew about every inch of the zoo to prevent the penguins' escape into cooler water. He was also expecting that the penguins were going to fly to the [[East River]], but he was defeated there. He landed on the taxi that Alice was returning in as it drives away.\n\nOfficer X attempted to regain his position in \"Littlefoot\" by capturing the monster currently attacking New York (the feral version of Marlene that had been separated from her normal self), but the penguins sabotaged this effort by recombining the two Marlenes, leaving Rico behind to give the impression that X's penguin-related \"insanity\" had prompted him to steal a penguin from the zoo. X loses his job again, leaving him upset.\n\nHis next appearance was in \"A Kipper for Skipper\" where he was working as a [[fishmonger]]. When Kowalski, Rico, and Private were arguing over the fish, X captured the three of them. Luckily, they were able to defeat him by dropping a bowling ball on him.\n\nHe was briefly seen in \"Goodnight and Good Chuck\" in which a video revealing all of the penguins' covert operations were broadcast worldwide. Officer X watched the news segment in Times Square and truimphantly told anyone who would listen that \"I told you!\" and \"I'm not crazy!\". He then calls his mother and tells her to turn on the TV to prove his sanity. Unfortunately, everyone else who watches it believes it to be a news hoax due to the sheer impossibility of the scenario and the amusing antics of the penguins in the video. Officer X drops to his knees and cries out in despair when still no one believes him.\n\nIn \"Snowmageddon\", X is now stacking shelves. When Skipper and Marlene go out for a snack run and a snowstorm traps them in the same shop, X manages to capture Skipper, and ties him up with a licorice whip then cages him under a plastic crate, which he sits on while calling animal control. Marlene helps to free Skipper and thanks to the destruction it can be assumed that X has lost his job again.\n\n===Joey===\nJoey (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]]) is a bad tempered and hostile [[red kangaroo]] with an Australian accent that always refers to himself in the third person who loves beating up anyone who steps foot in his habitat, especially [[#Skipper|Skipper]] and Julien. He first appeared in the season one episode, \"Assault and Batteries\" and later on in \"Cat's Cradle\" when he tried to beat up Officer X but was badly hurt instead. He also appeared to have a big role in \"Skorca!\" In the season two episode, \"Kanga-Management\", the Penguins accidentally destroy the Koala habitat, forcing Leonard to temporarily live with Joey until the pen is re-built, to both's dismay. Eventually, the two settle their differences and become friends, agreeing on their hatred for the penguins.\n\nEven though Joey has a pouch that only female kangaroos have, it is assumed by many fans that Joey is a female kangaroo with a masculine voice.\n\n===Leonard===\nLeonard (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]) is an extremely paranoid and nervous [[koala]]. He first appeared in \"Night and Dazed\", where he was shown to be very afraid of the penguins. After being accidentally launched into the city due to Kowalski's evacuation launcher, the penguins come save him and bring him back to the zoo.\n\nHe appears again in \"Kanga Management\" in which the penguins accidentally destroy his enclosure, forcing him to temporarily live in Joey's enclosure. He and Joey eventually become friends due to their hatred for the penguins.\n\nIn \"Nighty Night Ninja\", he watches a martial arts film with the penguins while he waits for his home to air out, due to a fish bomb. This causes him to start attacking the other animals in a sleep-walking state the next day. The penguins cure him by making him watch ''The Lunacorns'', and save him from the sewer rats, whom he had attacked earlier.\n\n===Hans===\nHans (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is a [[puffin]] with a past history with Skipper that involves a mission in [[Denmark]] that somehow resulted in Skipper being declared Public Enemy Number One in the country in question. During \"Huffin & Puffin\", he appeared in New York, initially apparently wanting to make peace with Skipper, before his true agenda was revealed to be his attempt to take control of the Penguins' lair for revenge. With Skipper having infiltrated the lair and defeated Hans, he was then shipped to the [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken Zoo]].\n\nHe appeared in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" and helped the penguins defeat the animal androids who had taken over the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nHe appeared in \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\", working with Doctor Blowhole as part of a plan to take Skipper's memories away.\n\n===Dr. Blowhole===\nDr. Blowhole (voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]) is an evil, mad [[bottlenose dolphin]] scientist and supervillain, who plans to take revenge on the human race: In the past, Blowhole was known as \"Flippy\", and was forced by humans to perform tricks at [[Coney Island]] for their own amusement. Dr. Blowhole is Skipper's arch-nemesis. He only has one (real) eye; his right eye is a robotic one, which hides a scar. He is described by Private and Skipper as being \"pure evil, with skin that's surprisingly pleasant to the touch\", which Blowhole claims is because he always moisturizes. He appears to love rubbing it in that he has far superior technology than the penguins do, which usually gets on Kowalski's nerves. Since he is a dolphin, he gets around by the use of a [[Segway PT|Segway-type]] vehicle while on land, which also projects a glass dome around it and Blowhole to turn into an escape vehicle. He also has a habit of referring to the penguins as \"pen-gyoo-wins\" (it is implied that he only does this to tick them off). Dr. Blowhole has a habit of having his deep-voiced computer announce the names of his creations in a dramatic voice (provided by [[Jim Cummings]]) instead of saying them himself (i.e. Chrome Claw). Unlike most cartoon villains, instead of simply leaving his enemies to die in a deathtrap, he typically stays to oversee their destruction personally, well aware they will likely escape somehow (telling Julien as much when asked), unless he'd be killed as well if he stays (such as locking them in his base as it self-destructs). In the special, the evil dolphin also proved able to hold his own with the combat-trained Skipper in a short physical fight.\n\nDr. Blowhole is mentioned in the episode \"Eclipsed\". Blowhole apparently had a plan to extinguish the Sun, as when Private told him that the sun went dark, Skipper believed that Dr. Blowhole had succeeded in his plan, but actually the sun went dark because of a [[Eclipse|solar eclipse]].\n\nIn \"Roomies\", Blowhole sends a [[walrus]] spy, named Rhonda a.k.a. Agent 12, to steal Kowalski's \"plasma cutter\" invention, which acts as a chain saw. The villainous dolphin himself is never seen the episode.\n\nDr. Blowhole kidnaps King Julien, believing him to be Skipper's best friend, in an effort to lure the flightless force into a trap so that he can annihilate them once and for all. Julien and Blowhole join forces and captures the \"pen-gu-wins\". After Blowhole reveals his plan to activate a \"Ring of Fire\" that he built in the North Pole to flood the world (saying it was inspired by a ring of fire he was forced to jump through when he was in captivity), Mort appears from the lair's skylight and frees the penguins after crashing into a control panel. Blowhole then activates the Ring of Fire after throwing Mort from the control panel. He then sends a giant mutated lobster he devised earlier in the episode called Chrome Claw after Skipper and the penguins (which he'd mentioned he was planning to create during their previous encounter) but they manage to defeat it. After a short battle with Skipper, Blowhole is betrayed by Julien, who claims to have been a double agent the entire time, and the \"Ring of Fire\" (which the media has dubbed the \"Hoop of Heat\", much to Blowhole's anger) is deactivated. Blowhole escapes, promising revenge.\n\nDoctor Blowhole was referenced in \"Invention Intervention\", where Skipper assumed that Kowalski's out-of-control invisible invisibility ray was actually created by Blowhole, commenting that his arch-nemesis had become far more intelligent&nbsp;\u2013 if harder to follow given the lack of motive behind such an attack&nbsp;\u2013 since their last confrontation.\n\nIn \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole\", Dr. Blowhole helps Skipper's rival, Hans the [[Puffin]], escape the [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] Zoo so he can lure Skipper into a trap. Once he ambushed him, he uses his clown-shaped \"Mind Jacker\" to steal Skipper's memories so he can use them to infiltrate the penguins' lair so he can turn them into his monster slaves using his \"Diaboligizer\". When he is about to blast the penguins with the Diaboligizer, he misfires, causing it to hit King Julien's [[MP3 player]] infused with Kowalski's experimental power cell (which Julien foolishly thought was a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]). The mix of the three resulted in a giant MP3 monster, which made everyone near it sing uncontrollably. Blowhole soon decides to use the creature to his advantage by winning it over with his beautiful singing voice. Once he was in control, he started using it to destroy [[New York City]]. Fortunately, Skipper returned to New York with the help of a spirit guide in the form of Alex the lion as seen earlier in the movie. Skipper distracted Blowhole while the penguins took out the source of the monster's power. With Blowhole foiled again and the monster back to normal, he tried to escape, but Skipper activated the Mind Jacker on Blowhole, wiping out his memories. He was soon returned to Coney Island under his old name of Flippy the Dolphin, where he was forced to jump through the Ring of Fire once again.\n\nHe is also mentioned in \"The Big S.T.A.N.K\", where he was the reason that S.T.A.N.K was created, to lure him to the toilet-shaped stink bomb, but the project was abandoned with the realization that dolphins don't use toilets. He was mentioned again in \"Operation: Big Blue Marble\" when Skipper suggested Blowhole as a suspect for the recent environmental chaos and random weather conditions that they were experiencing, but Kowalski confirmed that Blowhole was still at Coney Island as Flippy.\n\nIn \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\", it is revealed that Doris the dolphin (Kowalski's love interest) is his sister and his real name is Francis (which Red One, one of his Lobster minions, laughed off). He only created the name Dr. Blowhole since it earned him more respect.\n\n===Rhonda===\nRhonda (voiced by [[Kathy Kinney]]) is a very rude, unhygenic, lazy and obnoxious [[walrus]] (though she is depicted with buck teeth instead of tusks). She appears in the episode \"Roomies\" where she is transferred into Marlene's habitat. At first Marlene is excited to have another girl to hang out with, but gets annoyed by Rhonda very quickly due to her disgusting and obnoxious behavior. She asks the penguins to ship her out overnight, but stops the shipment after hearing she is getting taken to a polar bear reserve. Instead they send her to the Hoboken Zoo. At the end, we see that she is one of Dr. Blowhole's agents and stole Kowalski's plasma cutter.\n\nShe appears again, as an ally this time, in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" where she Hans, Clemson, Lulu and Savio help the penguins fight off animal androids in the Hoboken Zoo.\n\n===Bada and Bing===\nBada and Bing (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in Brooklyn accents) are giant [[eastern lowland gorilla]]s. Bada is a gray [[gorilla]] and Bing is a brown gorilla. First shown in the \"Kingdom Come\" episode when they served as thuggish bodyguards for Maurice, they have been seen displaying softer sides upon other occasions, such as when they looked after Mort in \"The Penguin Stays in the Picture\" while a photographer was there as an unrequested favor to Private, who wanted to be on the cover of the zoo brochure.\n\nThe two are attacked by a super-enlarged Mort in the episode \"Mort Unbound\" in order for him to get King Julien's stolen mango back.<ref name=\"Mort Unbound\">{{Cite episode|title=Mort Unbound|episodelink=List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep21|series=The Penguins of Madagascar|serieslink=The Penguins of Madagascar|network=[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]|airdate=June 26, 2009|season=1|number=21|minutes=4:18}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Truth Ache,\" it is revealed that Bing sleeps with a stuffed rabbit named Mr. Bunny.\n\n===Burt===\nBurt (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] in the TV series, [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the video games) is an [[Indian elephant]] who was just an extra zoo animal during the beginning of the series, but then evolved into a character of greater focus as the series evolved.\n\nHe was central to the episode \"An Elephant Never Forgets\", in which he leaves the zoo to locate a man who had irritated him as a boy by playing his kazoo at the zoo.\n\nIn the 2005 videogame version of ''Madagascar'', Burt was called Darnell.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBurt is shown to be obsessed with [[peanut]]s, and when he does not eat them, he goes insane as shown in \"Jungle Law\". He nearly eats Julien when he mistakes him for a peanut.\n\nHe played a vital role in the penguins' defeat of the ruthless boa constrictor Savio due to his sheer size preventing Savio from attacking him, squeezing Savio so that the snake's previously-swallowed victims were released.\n\n===Roger===\nRoger (voiced by [[Richard Kind]]) is the penguins' [[American alligator]] friend who [[Sewer alligator|lives in the sewer]]. They meet him in the episode \"Haunted Habitat\" when Skipper and Marlene go to investigate in the sewer under Marlene's habitat because of a strange sound. Roger tells the penguins that he is from Florida and that he was the pet of a young boy until he was flushed into the sewers by the boy's parents.\n\nHe appears again in \"Roger Dodger\" when the Sewer Rats terrorize him. Kowalski swapped his mind with Rico's to drive away the Sewer Rats and then had to work to get their minds back into their respectful bodies. Roger is uncomfortable in Rico's body and keeps regurgitating weapons uncontrollably, despite his pacifist nature.\n\nIn \"Gator Watch,\" the overload of sewage causes problems for Roger at the time when the penguins were visiting him. The penguins had to work to find the right home for him since the \"zoo overlords\" would be surprised at the sudden appearance of Roger. First they tried a park with Roger disguised as a log. A woman recognized him. Then the penguins try to disguise Roger as an exhibit at the museum. Two boys ended up giving Roger away. Another idea was to have Roger pose as a [[gargoyle]] at the top of a building. Roger fell off the building and into a populated swimming pool. This caused the entire city to end up in a Gator Watch which ended with Roger getting captured by animal control at a theater. When the penguins worked to free Roger, the location Roger was taken to was the Central Park Zoo where an alligator habitat has been set up by the zoo staff.\n\nSince then, he has made background appearances.\n\n===Max===\nMax (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]) is the penguins' stray [[tabby cat]] friend who lives in an alley near Central Park. He first meets the four penguins in the episode \"Launchtime\" when the penguins end up on a rooftop across the street from the zoo instead of on the moon. At first, the penguins thought he was a \"mooncat\", but at the end they figure out he was just a stray cat. Max is skinny and hopes to catch a bird in his life. He at first wanted to eat the penguins, but was so touched when he was given a can of fish by them that he became their friend instead. He has a very small cameo in \"The Helmet\".\n\nIn \"Cat's Cradle\", Max tried to escape Officer X. With help from the Penguins, Max and penguins managed to trick Officer X into getting attacked by a wildcat called the Red Rhodesian Slasher.\n\nHe appears once more in \"Street Smarts\" where Max helps the Penguins retrieve Mort from Elmer by teaching them how to be a dog. In the end, Max and Elmer become close friends, but only because Elmer thinks that Max is a lemur.\n\n===Duck Family===\nThe [[American Pekin duck|Duck]] Family are a family of ducks that live in a pond in Central Park.\n\n====Mother Duck====\nMother Duck (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is a white duck who is the mother of Bradley, Samuel, Ramona, and Eggy.\n\n====Eggy====\nEggy (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is a duckling who is the son of Mother Duck and the brother of Ramona, Samuel and Bradley. In \"Paternal Egg-Stinct,\" Marlene found an abandoned egg in her habitat. She gave it to the penguins to look after. Julien wanted the egg for himself. He called it Julien Junior, or JJ for short. Private called the egg Eggy. At the end, Marlene brings Mother Duck to the penguins to get her duckling back.\n\nUnfortunately, the effects of the Penguins' training goes to a point where Mother Duck asks the Penguins to do something to stop him as seen in \"Hard Boiled Eggy.\" Their attempts to show Eggy the dangerous portion of their missions fails, as the duckling goes on a rampage taking down all the animals in the zoo where Eggy inherits the penguins' traits; Skipper's drive, Kowalski's tatical mind, Rico's psychosis and Private's \"fake\" British accent.\n\n====Ramona, Bradley and Samuel====\nRamona, Bradley and Samuel (all three voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]) are ducklings who are Eggy's siblings and Mother Duck's children. Like Eggy's previous personas before becoming more like Julien in Hard Boiled Eggy, they crave action and mayhem.\n\n===Frederico===\nFred (voiced by [[Fred Stoller]]) is a dimwitted [[Eastern gray squirrel|squirrel]] that lives in Central Park and takes everything said literally and has a slow, unemphatic speech pattern. Kowalski met Fred briefly in the \"Otter Gone Wild\" episode, while the full penguin group met him in \"Mask of the Raccoon\" where he is friends with Archie despite the fact that Archie is no good.\n\nHe dated Marlene in \"Otter Things Have Happened\", but she broke up with him because what she had thought was him being funny turned out to be just Fred\u2019s ignorance.\n\nIn \"Field Tripped,\" Julien recruited him to be the 'smart one' of Julien's all-mammal penguin-team-equivalent.\n\nFred was part of a treasure hunt in the episode \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel\".\n\n===Roy===\nRoy (voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) is a short-tempered [[white rhinoceros]], appearing predominantly as an extra zoo animal for the majority of the series. When given more of a role, he often appears to have little-to-no patience for any animal that provokes him, usually responding with threats, such as when a truth-telling Private nearly revealed a secret about him in the \"Truth Ache\" episode involving a \"vacation\" in [[Tijuana]].\n\nHe plays a pivotal role in the \"April Fools\" episode when he threatens Julien with retaliation for drawing on his backside with a permanent marker. It is revealed that he was working with the penguins to teach Julien a lesson for his constant April Fools' Day pranks on everyone in August.\n\nIn \"Antics on Ice\", it was revealed that he is a fan of the Lunacorns series due to their positive focus on a horned animal.\n\nTwice in the episode \"Action Reaction,\" he sat on Julien.\n\n===Pinky===\nPinky (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a sassy [[American flamingo]], who usually only appears as an extra zoo animal in the series. Her only main role, so far, has been in her debut episode \"Go Fish.\" In this episode she was used for aerial support when the penguins wanted to take fish from a fish delivery truck. Somehow she wound up getting all the fish for herself by the end of the episode.\n\nIn the episode \"Operation: Good Deed\" the penguins need one of Pinky's feathers so that Julien would let Maurice massage Mason. She agrees to give them one after they got her peanuts through a series of additional tasks.\n\n===Darla===\nDarla (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in a Western accent) is a very tough, unfriendly, aggressive, tomboyish, determined but also kind-hearted, sweet and caring [[Guinea baboon]]. She appears mainly as a background zoo animal. She was first mentioned in \"Assault and Batteries\", but made her first appearance in \"Out of the Groove\". In this episode, she stole Julien's groove after he [[skunk]]-bombed her. After several attempts by the Penguins to get the groove back, she finally gives it back when Skipper manages to make Julien apologize.\n\nShe had her second major role in \"Hair Apparent\". In this episode, she began pampering Maurice (thinking he was a male baboon after he got most of his tail fur ripped off, got red paint on his bottom, and got Commissioner McSlade's toupee stuck on his head making Julien jealous. The penguins later take the wig from Maurice to return it, making Darla angry to find out Maurice is a lemur. By the end of the episode, she decides to pamper Mort instead.\n\n====Carol and Jillian====\nCarol and Jillian (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) are Darla's baboon friends who are often seen with her.\n\n===Shelly===\nShelly (voiced by [[Melissa McCarthy]]) is an [[ostrich]] who lives in the Central Park Zoo. For most of the series, she only appears as a background zoo animal.\n\nHer first major role and her first speaking role so far is in the episode \"Love Takes Flightless\". In this episode she falls for Rico after he saves her from being frozen in cement by demolishing it. She tries to get Rico's attention by hiding his doll in the dumpster. After seeing how upset Rico was about it, she helps the penguins get it back from the garbage truck. At the end, Shelly gets herself a muscular male doll and becomes happy with it.\n\n===Becky and Stacy===\nBecky and Stacy (voiced by [[Jennette McCurdy]] and [[Victoria Justice]]) are two [[American badger]]s that are residents of the zoo. It hasn't been revealed if they are either friends or sisters. They are prone to having to put up with badger stereotypes.\n\nPrivate was initially fearful of badgers, but Becky and Stacy won his heart by giving him Peanut Butter Winkies. After Private left, Becky and Stacy started badgering Marlene into doing wild and crazy things with them. Marlene, annoyed, tells them to stop badgering her. They ended up attacking Marlene due to the use of badger stereotypes. They were eventually defeated when Marlene fell outside the park and went into her wild state. After that incident, Becky and Stacy appear to respect and fear Marlene since they all have a picnic with the penguins in the park with the two of them being held in between wild Marlene's arms.\n\nBecky and Stacy both make a reappearance in \"Tunnel of Love,\" where they fall in love with the beavers and romance interferes with the beavers' work.\n\n===Randy===\nRandy (voiced by [[Will Friedle]]) is a [[sheep]] who lives at the Children's Zoo at the Central Park Zoo. Children are constantly coming to pet him. Many of them have sticky hands due to eating too much candy.\n\nIn his debut episode \"Can't Touch This,\" one kid in particular hits him and rips his fur until finally Randy cannot stand the torture any longer resulting in Randy biting the kid. The kid screams, causing Alice to come and see what the problem is. The penguins hear the boy's cry as well. When they get there and see the child lie to Alice. Alice apologizes, and puts Randy in a cage. Skipper then says they're going to teach the sheep a lesson for biting a child. Once Randy tells them their story, the Penguins decide to help Randy with his predicament by using various defense methods including: \"Repelling\" Polymer, Static Electricity, and Hypnosis, all of which backfire. Eventually, Randy ends up back in the Petting Zoo, but as a consultation, Skipper and Rico teach him some self-defense combat techniques to prevent anymore accidents.\n\nRandy appears again in \"Operation: Neighbor Swap\" where he welcomes the Lemurs into the petting zoo but once Julien gets comfortable, he too grows tired and annoyed of his constant bossing. He helps the penguins formulate a plan to get Julien back to his old habitat.\n\n===Muffy, Buffy, and Fluffy===\nMuffy, Buffy and Fluffy (all three voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]) are three adorable, cute, and cuddly [[rabbit]]s who reside in the Central Park Children's Zoo. As shown in the show they appear to be cute and innocent but they happen to be very good fighters (evident by how they managed to beat up the penguins with ease).\n\nThey made their first appearance in \"Operation: Neighbor Swap,\" when the Lemurs were transferred to the Petting Zoo. When they met the lemurs, they became loyal to King Julien because they heard he was a king (and because of his \"magnificent\" tail).\n\n===Clemson===\nClemson (voiced by [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]) is a very descriptive and exuberant [[bamboo lemur]] who made his first appearance in the episode \"Right Hand Man.\". After being transferred to the Central Park Zoo, Clemson tried to replace Maurice as Julien's right hand man by constantly pampering him. Mort (who had suspected Clemson was evil since he arrived) found out that Clemson was planning to ship Julien to the Hoboken Zoo so that he could take over as king. The Penguins later turn the tables on him by pushing Clemson into the crate to be sent off.\n\nClemson appeared again in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" where he helped the Penguins fight off the android animals of the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nClemson's returns in \"King Me\" where he informs the lemurs that Julien can't inherite the crown and nearly wins a contest to see who would be king. He was thwarted when the Penguins switched Clemson's brain with Julien's. Julien in Clemson's body then decrees \"Julien\" king right before they are switched back. Clemson is then chased back to Hoboken by Bada and Bing after Julien insulted them while still in Clemson's body.\n\n===Lulu===\nLulu (voiced by [[Jane Leeves]]) is a female [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]. She first appears in \"Monkey Love\", in which she was staying at the Central Park Zoo while her habitat in the Hoboken Zoo was being repaired. Once she showed up, Phil fell in love with her. When Mason tries to set the two up, she thinks Mason is asking her out. After several failed attempts by the penguins and King Julien to show off Phil's skills, Phil explains the whole situation to her in American Sign Language and she agrees to go out with him before she has to leave.\n\nShe appears again in \"The Hoboken Surprise\", along with Hans, Savio, Clemson and Rhonda, where she helps the penguins fight off the android animals of the Hoboken Zoo.\n\n===Doris===\nDoris (voiced by [[Calista Flockhart]]) is a dolphin. Kowalski has a crush on her who is spoken of in several episodes. As shown in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep76|Hot Ice]],\" Kowalski sees her as a love interest, though it appears to be unrequited (since Doris wanted someone \"hipper\").\n\nDoris makes her first appearance in \"The Penguin who Loved Me\" and is revealed to be the sister of Dr. Blowhole. She wishes for Kowalski to help her free her brother Francis from captivity along with a [[platypus]] named Parker. After the penguins and Parker follow Doris to Seaville, they get to Francis' exhibit where it is revealed he is none other than Dr. Blowhole, who has forgotten who he really is and thinks he's Flippy because of his memories being wiped out and is now happily performing tricks for people. Parker than betrays the Penguins and Doris when he reveals he works for Dr. Blowhole and takes him back to the base where all the Lobsters are. As they try to restore his memories, Doris and The Penguins storm in and the aforementioned characters get in a fight. Soon enough Doris accidentally finds Blowhole's Mind Jacker and Parker uses it to restore his memories. Blowhole then captures the Penguins and Doris, and reveals his evil plan is to fire his new weapon \"Project Bad Tidings\" at the moon, flood the entire world and rule it. But after Kowalski tricks him and they foil his plan and manage to escape before the base explodes. As soon as they get back home, Doris tells Kolwaski that she likes him now and they kiss for the first time.\n\n===Savio===\nSavio (voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]) is a large [[green anaconda]] (often simply referred to as a [[boa constrictor]]) that has attacked the animals on three occasions. When he was initially transferred to the zoo in \"The Big Squeeze\", the penguins suspected him of being the cause of the disappearance of the lemurs and Marlene, but his cage appeared inescapable; the only means of departure was a vent that Savio could have used when unfed but would have been unable to access when returning. Skipper realises that he was instead using the vent to access the keypad that controlled his cage locks with his tail, allowing him to open his cage. He was defeated on this occasion when the penguins lured him into Burt's habitat, with Burt throwing Savio around and squeezing him through the bars to expel his previously-eaten victims. Alice later had Savio transferred to the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nSavio returned as an enemy in \"All Tied Up With a Boa\", intending to eat the penguins, the lemurs, and Marlene in revenge for their previous defeat- subsequently intending to regurgitate them and eat them in reverse order to his previous consumption- after immobilising Burt by sending a mouse to the zoo to trick him into running into a wall in panic, but Julien managed to escape by hiding in the popcorn machine and becoming covered in butter, his slippery form resulting in Savio becoming tied up in knots, covered in butter, and sent back to Hoboken.\n\nSavio appeared as an ally in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" where he assisted the penguins in defeating the android animals of the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nSavio returns again in \"The Terror of Madagascar\" when Julien has him transferred back to the zoo as he had hired him to eat a baby fossa that he believes is trying to eat him, but the fossa is revealed to see Julien as a father figure and defeats Savio by biting him and chases him back to Hoboken (While annoying Skipper at the idea that the penguins have now not defeated Savio three times & yells in frustration seeing Savio defeated by the fossa instead of them).\n\n===The Vesuvius Twins===\nThe Vesuvius Twins (voiced by [[Atticus Shaffer]]) are two schoolboys from a very wealthy family. They are disliked by all of the animals of the zoo because of how nasty they are. Even though they are repeatedly banned from going near the animals, they usually get around the ban because of their parent's wealth, e.g. purchasing all of the tickets for an event at the zoo. Private often encourages others to show kindness to the boys, choosing to believe that they are secretly good.\n\n===Cecil and Brick===\nCecil and Brick (voiced by [[French Stewart]] and [[John DiMaggio]]) are two criminals that have occasionally run afoul of the Penguins.\n\n===Archie===\nArchie (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is a [[raccoon]] with a [[Robin Hood]]-like motive and a friend of Fred. He first appears in \"Mask of the Raccoon\" where he has been going around stealing from the zoo and supposedly giving to the poor. His plot was exposed by the Penguins upon learning about him from Fred and ends up having to give to the poor.\n\nIn \"The Big Move,\" Archie appears as a property agent where he tries to sell Rico a house. In this appearance, he is not in his Robin Hood costume and not using a French accent.\n\n===Amarillo Kid===\nThe Amarillo Kid (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[nine-banded armadillo]].\n\nA long time ago, the Amarillo Kid challenged Private to a game of mini golf, back when Private was one of the best mini golf players and was known as Mr. Tux. Private quit after the game, which ended in a tie, because he had to hit a little possum girl's ice cream cone (it was a double scoop) to tie it up. Though Private admitted that the pressure made him quit after all. Several years later in \"Mr. Tux,\" he arrived at the Central Park Zoo to challenge Private to a game to prove he's the best. At first, Private refuses to fight him. Enraged by this, the Kid locked down the entire zoo and threatened to blow it up with a thermonuclear reactor. Private battles him, and though the game is close, Private wins with the help of a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] he had saved early. Ashamed, the Amarillo Kid leaves.\n\nThe Amarillo Kid later returns in \"Showdown on Fairway 18,\" but this time has a changed personality. This time, he comes to the Penguins for help when he has lost a mini-golf match against the Gopher Brothers Bo and Gomer and they want his shell (which the Amarillo Kid used in a wager). The Amarillo Kid tells him of the Westchester Putter from Yabogeyhaha, a golden golf putting club which grants its wielder unbeatable power so that even the worst will become the greatest, and he desires to use it in a rematch against the Gophers to save himself. Private and the Amarillo Kid find the Westchester Putter. Through a series of comical foul-ups, they finally claim the Putter. Private hands the Westchester Putter over to the Amarillo Kid on the agreement that he will return it as soon as he has won his rematch. Touched by Private's kindness, the Amarillo Kid confesses his intentions to steal the Putter for the Gophers in order to save his shell as Private's emotions egged him & made him feel guilt for what he was preparing to do. He decides to turn over a new leaf, and voluntarily puts the Putter back, saying he'd rather go shell-less than proving Skipper & Private right that he hadn't changed. Just then, the other penguins and the Gophers show up. The Gophers trap the penguins under a chandelier, take the Westchester Putter for themselves, and escape the building, proving that the Amarillo Kid had been telling the truth and they had tricked Skipper and his team into helping them as Kowalski recapped the gophers' clever ingenuity of their plan. As they make their getaway, the Amarillo Kid stays to free the penguins. The penguins and the Amarillo Kid pursue the Gophers in a mini golf cart chase. Just as it seems the Gophers are going to give the penguins the slip, the Amarillo Kid uses his golfing skills to sabotage their cart and save the Putter. With the Gophers successfully thwarted, the Amarillo Kid thanks Private for believing in him, and they part on good terms... that is, only after Private reminds the Amarillo Kid remembers he is supposed to give the Westchester Putter back.\n\n===Miss Perky===\nMiss Perky (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is Rico's [[doll]] girlfriend.\n\n===Granny Squirrel===\nGranny [[Squirrel]] (voiced by [[Debbie Reynolds]]) first appeared as a granny of Fred in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel,\" but then the gang believed she is a ghost.\n\n===Barry===\nBarry (voiced by [[Kevin McDonald]]) is a [[strawberry poison-dart frog]] who first appears in the episode \"Untouchable\" where he is a transfer from the Hoboken Zoo and begins terrorizing the animals by temporarily poisoning Skipper, Kowalski and Rico. Private manages to stop him by putting on a steel suit and hugging him, making Barry realize he only needed a friend.\n\nHe appears mainly as a background zoo animal in more recent episodes.\n\n===Frankie===\nFrankie (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[homing pigeon]] who first appeared on \"Launchtime.\"\n\n===The Red Squirrel===\nThe [[American red squirrel|Red Squirrel]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is an evil red squirrel who appears in the episodes \"The Red Squirrel,\" \"A Visit From Uncle Nigel,\" \"Our Man in Grrfurjiclestan,\" and \"Nuts to You.\"\n\n===The Broches===\nThe Broches are the trio of [[American cockroach|cockroaches]] who appears in the episode \"Stop Bugging Me.\"\n\n====Mike====\nMike (voiced by [[Zand Broumand]]) is a member of the Broches.\n\n====Duane====\nDuane (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]]) is a member of the Broches.\n\n====Eddie====\nEddie (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]]) is a member of the Broches.\n\n===Frances Alberta===\nFrances Alberta (voiced by [[Megan Hilty]]) is the presumptive head [[zookeeper]] at the Hoboken Zoo who appeared in the episode \"The Hoboken Surprise.\" Frances was first shown to be a cheerful zookeeper who had worked to clean up the zoo's poor conditions, gaining the respect of resident animals Rhonda, Hans, Clemson, Savio, and Lulu. Frances also afforded the animals under her care many amenities, such as fine cuisine, massage chairs, and a fountain of cheese. It is later revealed that Frances never had the respect of her animals, whom she had simply sealed away under the ground and replaced with android look-alikes, all in an effort to meet her demanding standard for cleanliness and to get the attention of Parks Commissioner Pervis McSlade. At the end of the episode, Commissioner McSlade fires her and the Hoboken Police arrests her for making android look-alike animals and assault of a Bartender.\n\n===Kitka===\nKitka (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is a female [[peregrine falcon]] whom Skipper falls in love with. She only appears in \"The Falcon and the Snow Job\".\n\n===Nurse Shawna W. Smith===\nShawna W. Smith (voiced by [[Joanna Garcia]]) is a zoo nurse who only appears in the episode \"Love Hurts\".\n\n===Special Agent Buck Rockgut===\nSpecial Agent Buck Rockgut (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]) is a [[Northern rockhopper penguin|rockhopper penguin]] who first appears in \"The Red Squirrel\".\n\n===Hunter===\nHunter (voiced by [[Ciara Bravo]]) is a young female [[leopard seal]] who doesn't eat penguins. She only appears in the episode \"Operation: Antarctica\".\n\n===Uncle Nigel===\nUncle Nigel (voiced by [[Peter Capaldi]]) is Private's uncle, who works as a spy for MI6, and comes to New York to visit his nephew and to find The Red Squirrel. His first, and so far only, appearance is in \"A Visit From Uncle Nigel.\"\n\nWhen around the penguins (minus Private), Nigel acted like a \"posh nancycat\". This was all part of his cover story. When captured by The Red Squirrel, Nigel was forced to tell Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico that he actually was a spy.\n\nIt is unknown if Nigel really is Private's uncle in blood or not (due to being a different species of penguin). Though it is possible that he is either an honorary uncle or perhaps one of Private's parents was the same species of penguin Nigel is and he is their brother whilst the other parent was the same species as Private.\n\n===Blue Hen===\nBlue Hen ( voiced by [[Audrey Wasilewski]]) is a [[chicken]] who is first introduced in \"Mental Hen\" as a mute animal with psychic powers. Kowalski, being a sceptic, records her and sends the video on internet, hoping someone will figure out that Blue Hen is faking her powers, only for her to gain popularity.\n\nShe is then revealed to just be extremely intelligent rather than psychic, being able to figure out what's going to happen with analytical thinking. She can also talk and becomes an enemy of penguins after they find out that she was waiting for someone like Kowalski to expose her so that she can gain popularity and power. Unable to defeat her rationally or by fighting, Kowalski sets up a plan to distract her by singing and dancing seductively, leading her to choose the wrong option. While she starts holding a grudge against Kowalski, she compliments his dancing ability and kisses him.\n\nShe returns in P.E.L.T as an antagonist.\n\n===Manfredi and Johnson===\nManfredi and Johnson (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] and [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) are [[penguin]]s who were former members of Skipper's team. They are typically cited for the nature of their demise or a mistake they made as an example of what can happen if one lets their guard down or neglects their training. The exact method of their demise varies in each instance and in some cases are contradictory: killed by an exploding trap, killed by flying piranhas, losing vital internal organs, etc.\n\nThey are finally seen in \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\", in an enclosure in Seaville both with bruises and injuries, but very much alive. However, they have somehow injured their eyes. Manfredi (the larger sized penguin) has lost his left foot now replaced by a stick while Johnson (the Kowalski-sized penguin) broke his right flipper and seems to have a burn on his body. Johnson noticed the penguins and Doris \"flying out\" of Seaville and banged on the glass panel for help. Unfortunately for them, the penguins never noticed their desperate pleas and swam away saying they were never going to come back ever again.\n\nStrangely they do not appear in ''Penguins of Madagascar'', implying that they may have met the four at a much later time.\n\n==Characters in ''All Hail King Julien''==\n\n===Clover===\nClover (voiced by [[India de Beaufort]]) is a green-eyed [[crowned lemur]] who is King Julien's bodyguard. She is smart, cunning, (mostly) mature, but tends to be rather paranoid (comes with the job), is brave to the point of recklessness and can be prone to sudden outbursts of violence, but can also be sweet, friendly and kind-hearted towards her friends. In general, she and Maurice tend to be the voice of reason to keep Julien's crazy ideas in check.\n\nAfter the events of the first episode, Clover becomes his commander. She is the main protector King Julien (since the other guards ran away) Despite the fact that she thinks the new king isn't very bright she is fanatically loyal and faithful to him and is even willing to die for her king. Unlike his uncle, Julien treats her with a lot more respect (for example at the end of episode one he points out that he noticed she was the only one of the guards who didn't run away and because of that his promoting her to commander). Her shocked response to the comment implies that uncle Julien never bothered to even compliment her. A running gag is that she acts like she is talking with someone through a radio earpiece. She didn't believe in having a fun life until she slid down the water slide going after Mort during Uncle King Julien XII's return. In \"Eat Prey Shove\", it is revealed she writes a rather fan fiction-y romantic novel as a hobby. It is also here she meets Sage Moondancer, with whom Clover has a rather complex romantic relationship - while she loves him, his stoic and peaceful nature often irritates her. It takes several seasons for both of them to realize they balance each other out as the perfect weapon.\n\nIn \"Crimson and Clover,\" it is revealed that Clover has a twin sister named Crimson, with whom she has a long lasting rivalry. Despite their antagonistic behaviour, they still consider each other family and Crimson has helped Clover out on occasion.\nIn the storyline of \"Exiled\", Clover went on a quest with Sage to find the perfect weapon, only to realize through the teachings of Sage's annoying mudskipper master that they need each other to be in perfect balance (after spending a day body-swapped). Koto, Sage's evil brother wanted to force Clover to marry him, and she was ready to make this sacrifice for the life of Julien, but in the end she was freed and was essential in defeating Koto and his army.\n\nIn Season 5, when King Julien puts security cameras all over the kingdom, Clover is overjoyed to finally be able to enforce all the long-forgotten ancient laws she never had the chance to. This overzealousness causes everyone in the kingdom to be arrested eventually, with Clover turning herself in too when she got up from the bed on the wrong foot. In episode 12, she expects Sage to propose to her, but finds out he is marrying her sister, Crimson. Trying to suppress her anger, she stays to help the mountain lemur kingdom, and eventually causes Sage to realize she is his soulmate, hurrying after her and proposing to her. This causes some concern for King Julien, as Clover will leave the kingdom after the marriage, so he tries to train the kingdom into an army, leading to disaster when real foosas attack. In the last episode, the wedding eventually proceeds after some hiccups, such as Julien burying Sage and forgetting where he was, and creating a Frankenstein's monster version to stand in for the wedding, while Clover reconciles with Crimson and says her goodbye to Julien. She leaves for the mountain lemur kingdom with Sage at the end of the episode after the wedding, explaining her absence in the Madagascar movies.\n\n===Masikura===\nMasikura (voiced by [[Debra Wilson]]) is a [[psychic]] [[chameleon]] who appears once you call her. She sticks her tongue on your head and analyzes you for predictions or reading thoughts. He told Julien's uncle that the king of the lemurs would be eaten by the Foosa. With that, Uncle King Julien hands over the crown to his nephew and leaves. At the coronation, the Foosa interrupted and take some lemurs with them. Masikura told King Julien, Maurice, and Clover about what happened. King Julien goes to the Foosa territory to save the lemurs, he got bitten on the butt, he shouts and the boulders fall down, scaring the Foosa. Julien was relieved that Masikura was wrong about the Foosa eating him. Masikura appears and say she didn't say the Foosa wouldn't eat all of him completely and points at his butt.\n\nIn \"Poll Position\", King Julien calls Masikura to use her tongue on Xixi's head to find out who's the one hater. Masikura denined, but King Julien grabbed her and starts shooting her tongue at Xixi. Her tongue hits Maurice's head and predicted grape jelly, a funnel, and a pair of woman shoes. Maurice said it was spring break.\n\nIn \"He Blinded Me with Science,\" Masikura played a big role, where she helps King Julien dance for the sky god Kevin to make it rain. When King Julien meets Timo, a [[tenrec]] scientist, he automates everything in the kingdom and they got hooked up on science. Later, King Julien let Masikura go, much to her dismay. She meets Mort in his tree stump and insisted to stay with him. During her stay, Masikura gets creeped out with Mort, saying he \"sleep hugs\" and says that he is a girl. Then, a fire breaks out from the generator, King Julien apologizes to Masikura and he, Maurice, and Clover ask for her help. Masikura believes that if they combined science and the rain that would put out the fire and save the kingdom. Timo makes a makeshift hose and King Julien danced on it to get the water out, thus putting the fire out.\n\n===Maggie the Unwashed===\nMaggie (voiced by [[Andy Richter]]) is a poor replacement of Masikura, her predictions are shams and she constantly suffers from extreme flatulence. Maggie seems not to care about other people's opinion or about anything in general. She is often hired by various villains to be their accessory. Physically, she is identical to Masikura but has a much more pale color and is constantly cross-eyed.\n\n===Prince Barty===\nPrince Barty (voiced by [[John Michael Higgins]]) is a ring-tailed lemur who is the father of King Julien XIII and the husband of Princess Julienne. He always acts in a posh and upper-class manner. Like his wife, he does not care much about his son, or the fate of the kingdom, and they are content to live on a remote island as long as the kingdom sends them their regular mango supply. Whenever they visit King Julien, they always live in extreme luxury, serviced by a horde of servants. Often they have \"parties\" for their relatives (in actuality the relatives are killed by sharks).\n\n===Princess Julienne===\nPrincess Julienne (voiced by [[Anjelica Huston]]) is a ring-tailed lemur who is the mother King Julien XIII and the wife of Prince Barty. She is also the sister of Uncle King Julien. Like her husband, she does not care about her son at all, only that her constant supply of mango is provided on time, so she only shows up whenever there is any emergency in the kingdom that would threaten their income used to support their extravagant lifestyle. King Julien desperately wants their parents approval and love at first, even going as far as to hire Karl to kidnap them - however this turns into a real life-or-death situation due to Karl's betrayal. After his parents actually start to care about him, Julien gets annoyed by their constant doting and eventually gets them to leave.\n\n===King Julien XII===\nKing Julien XII (voiced by [[Henry Winkler]]) is a ring-tailed lemur who is the uncle of King Julien XIII. As Julien XIII's predecessor, Julien XII is a lazy, strict, paunchy, cowardly, and older lemur oozing smarminess where he had strict rules that kept the lemur kingdom quiet in order to keep the Fossa away. In the first episode, he gives the crown to his nephew and leaves when he learns from Masikura that the king of the lemurs will be eaten by the Foosa. When King Julien saves the captured lemurs, he got bitten on the butt and is still alive. When King Julien XIII thrives as king, his devious uncle will do any conniving thing to regain the throne.\n\nUncle King Julien returned in the fifth episode, not happy that his nephew is still alive and set to reclaim the throne from him. When King Julien was sliding down the water slide, his uncle turns off the water, leaving his rear end on fire. King Julien then sees his uncle and has a hard time remembering him, much to his annoyance. Maurice helped Julien remember by placing his crown on his uncle's head. He made up a story and tricked his nephew that he heard the Fossa were planning an attack and Julien volunteers to go to their territory and find out with Maurice in a Fossa disguise. During his absence, Uncle King Julien made changes to his throne room. Mort goes up to the throne room and sees Julien's uncle. Uncle Julien takes a seriously hatred of Mort. Mort says that Julien, (the other Julien), is the one and only king and is \"a billion times better than him\", which makes him mad. Uncle Julien orders Clover to destroy Mort, but Mort says he'd rather be destroyed by \"his King Julien\" and runs off crying. After seeing the changes his nephew made, he orders Clover to close down everything Julien put up. When Clover closed everything down, she chased Mort down the water slide when he was violating the rule against it and she actually enjoyed it. Clover tells Julien's uncle what happened and says the kingdom is happy for the first time in a long time and vows to help improve when Julien comes back. When Julien's uncle says that Julien is not coming back, Clover, discovering Julien's uncle's plot, angrily forces Uncle Julien to say it again and drags him to the Foosa territory. They see Julien and Maurice in the Fossa suit surrounded by the Fossa. Uncle Julien is unhappy that Clover wants his nephew as king. Before Uncle Julien can hit Clover, she hits Uncle Julien and uses him as bait to attract the Foosa and saves Julien and Maurice, while fighting the Fossa via suit. Julien knows his uncle's plot to reclaim the throne and is glad that Clover chose him, even though she didn't think the kingdom should be fun 24/7 but knows living in fear is worst. While taunting the Fossa with Uncle King Julien still as bait, Maurice wondered about what will they do with him, as he is not to be trusted. Julien says that his uncle is still family and \"family always deserves a second chance.\" He suggests that they should give his uncle \"a chance at a new life.\" The episode ends with Uncle Julien in the Foosa suit that is being cuddled by a Fossa girl much to his dismay. In a later episode he creates his own kingdom, Feartopia, tricks his nephew into giving him all his subjects, and imprisons them there as \"citizens\"; he is later imprisoned alone inside his own little dystopia. In season 5, he decided to give up his throne for Zora and flee with her for his joyfulness in which his nephew gave his excuses.\n\nAccording to Masikura in \"Viva Mort,\" Julien's uncle is the worst king because he did some things to other kingdoms and never apologized. Masikura told King Julien he doesn't have to be his uncle, when she is trying to help him apologize to Maurice.\n\nIn a later plot, Uncle King Julien lures the whole kingdom to another island by faking the end of the world, only to imprison them in a camp and locking his nephew in the \"Iron Booty\". In the end, Julien frees everyone, and instead locks his uncle inside the camp.\n\nUncle King Julien returns to participate in the Jungle Olympics, enlisting Crimson and Sage on his team, trying to win the games - and the crown.\n\nIn Exiled, he is revealed to be running gladiatorial games and training foosa with Mary Ann. King Julien and Maurice go undercover in their bad foosa disguise, but Uncle King Julien easily sees through it, and tries to kill them. He joins their effort to save the kingdom when he learns it has been taken over by Koto, though.\n\nIn the Season 5 episode \"Night Creatures\", he visits alongside his sister, King Julien's mother, to investigate the strange beast hauntings in the kingdom, hoping that he can get the crown back if King Julien is declared incompetent to rule. It is revealed though that he himself engineered the beast attacks by feeding gecko milk to King Julien, which causes an allergic transformation in the Julien bloodline. Captured in a cage, he is fed milk and forced to transform himself.\n\nHe returns in a later episode, where he engineers a plot to cause King Julien to depopulate the kingdom due to the increased arrests thanks to the security cameras he supplied Julien with. However, while watching the events unfold on the cameras, he is smitten by Zora, and starts sending love letters to her. Eventually Maurice locates him in a cave, and King Julien confronts him after he stole the crown, but he admits he no longer wants it, only to live happily with Zora. After Julien introduces him to her, the two are instantly smitten, and they leave, Uncle King Julien promising not to try and kill his nephew anymore.\n\nThe two show up again in the last episode, attending Clover and Sage's wedding.\n\n===Ted===\nTed (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]] in ''Madagascar'', [[Andy Richter]] in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a [[Golden bamboo lemur]] with a slight accent. Throughout all the series, Ted is shown to be nervous at many times. He says silly things like \"Flipper-doodles\" or \"Maraschino cherries.\" Ted also has a tendency to joy- or fear-tinkle a lot, something he feels the need to exclaim loudly. He has a wife named Dorothy. Their marriage is revealed in the episode \"Diapers are the New Black\". Dorothy is more interested in the marriage than Ted, considering that he cried at their honeymoon. In the episode \"That Sinking Feeling\", when everyone thought the island was sinking, Dorothy tackled Hector just because he threw Ted way behind him. Ted makes appearances in most episodes, and played large roles in \"Eat Prey Shove,\" and, \"Diapers are the New Black.\" He was named as Clover's assistant captain of the Ringtail guard, but due to his cowardly nature (and because Clover is always around) he rarely if ever gets to do anything in this position. In \"Poll Position\" when people disliked King Julien, Ted would eat the kumquats off the pole, decreasing the popularity of people liking King Julien. He states it was his dream job and it has become a nightmare, when he ate too many kumquats because more people no longer like him. Maurice asks Julien why he has to eat the kumquats, and Julien answered it's the \"only thing that brings him joy.\"In \"Eat Prey Shove,\" Ted once covered for Clover when she was sent on a vacation with Mort and Xixi and unknowingly caused the Fossa to take advantage of Clover's vacation to attack King Julien's kingdom.\n\nIn Exiled, Ted stows away on the submarine with King Julien, Maurice and Pancho when they escape the kingdom after Koto's takeover. On the island inhabited by sultry lady lemurs, Ted is the only one (due to his devotion to Dorothy) who does not succumb to their seduction, and consequently, eludes capture. The stress of being alone and hunted causes a split personality to take over Ted, who rescues Maurice and King Julien from the Tentacle. Calling himself Snake, this version of him wears an eyepatch, vest, and has a handlebar moustache. Snake is an extremely competent and fearless fighter, who acts like a 1990s action movie star and often says his name out loud for no reason.\n\nIn season 5, being bored with Ted's indecisive nature, Dorothy convinces Ted to bring Snake out once again with Dr S' experimental methods. However, she soon finds Snake to be boring due to his one-track mind and lack of curiosity. While shutting down Timo's water pump, Snake is shocked back to Ted, and Dorothy apologizes to him, saying he is the lemur she married and loves, not Snake. Later, when cameras being placed everywhere in the kingdom lead to an increased number of arrests, Clover deputizes Ted to be the prison's warden, a job he performs with great delight. In the end, only he ends up being the only not imprisoned lemur in the kingdom after Clover arrests herself.\n\n===Willie===\nWillie (voiced by [[Cody Cameron]] in ''Madagascar'', [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a lemur who first appears in the first episode as one of the captured lemurs. King Julien saves them from the Foosa. Willie has a tendency to see the worst in everything, and his catchphrase is screaming \"We are all gonna die!\" whenever there is any crisis at hand. Consequently, King Julien tends to blame Willie for things he is not even responsible for. He goes so far as to often mention him by name whenever he has to make a public appearance to note whatever is troubling the country at the moment, adding \"...and also, Willie\" and eliciting an enraged \"What the heck, man?\" from him.\n\nWillie was briefly seen in the first film when he was called out during King Julien's meeting about what to do with Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria. He states that he likes them. It is noticeable that he has a different voice and design compared to his appearance in \"All Hail King Julien.\"\n\n===Xixi===\nXixi (voiced by [[Betsy Sodaro]]) is a very trustworthy [[toucan]] in news who informs the lemur kingdom on current events. According to King Julien, Xixi also a very trustworthy Toucan in friendship. She covered King Julien's coronation party but fled when the party was raided by the Foosa in the first episode.\n\nShe appears again in \"Poll Position\" in which she reports that 99% of the kingdom thinks the new king (Julien) is doing a good job. This report sets both episode plots in motion namely King Julien attempting to locate and turn the hater while also allowing Clover to launch an investigation to find the hater and make sure he isn't trying to recruit more lemurs to his side to cause an uprising.\n\nShe makes another appearance in \"Eat Pray Shove\", when she happily accepts to go on a vacation with Clover and Mort. Xixi and Mort enjoy relaxing on the beach, while Clover doesn't. Xixi and Mort have a fun time while Clover went off and meet a handsome and muscular lemur.\n\n===Hector===\nHector (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is an incredibly moody lemur. According to Maurice, Hector hates everybody and everything. He is also a bit odd. For example, when Clover asked if he didn't want to see King Julien to help him solve his problems, he replies to her that he likes his problems. According to Xixi, he has a very large family. Despite his bitterness, he does admit that King Julien is doing a better job than the previous kings. Hector also adds that he thinks that it is not a great accomplishment as he thinks the previous kings were much more incompetent than Julien was. In the episode \"Poll Position\", Hector was basically the only one who did not love Julien. After Julien knocked down Hector's masterpiece, his support went down by unhappiness of Hector's big family.\nIn another appearance, Hector joined Abner and Becca in using catapults to \"relocate\" everyone from the kingdom whom they did not like, this soon caused the kingdom to lose most of its populace.\n\nIn Season 5, he is revealed to be the Minister in charge of Mangoes, a post he fulfilled for a long time successfully protecting his charge from the fruit flies by a flyswatter he is really attached to. In the election battles between Maurice and Mort he is forced to abandon his post, leading to a crisis with the flies abducting everyone, but at the end he is restored to it again.\n\nDespite his grumpiness, Hector has a strong sense of logic and is often the only character to see how ridiculous a situation is. His catchphrase is declaring \"Bunch of ding-dongs\" whenever people do something stupid.\n\n===Horst===\nHorst (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a [[blue-eyed black lemur]]. As said by Clover in the episode My Fair Foosa, not much is known about him. Kind of a loner, fears change, and is always seen holding a beverage in a coconut shell. It was also revealed in the same episode that he was married to the fossa named Mary Ann but she mauled him twice because of his snoring. It is revealed in 'King Julien Superstar' that he is also known as DJ Glitter-Bunz.<ref>Watching All Hail King Julien</ref> He usually interrupts whatever he is saying by taking a long sip from his beverage through a straw before finishing the sentence, annoying others.\n\nIn Exiled, he and Mary Ann reconcile and get back together once again.\n\nIn Season 5, he is shown to be having a picnic with Mary Ann, still loving her despite her hard to suppress urges to eat him. When the other foosa rebel and tie the two to a tree, Horst reveals that due to the many scarring he received while romancing Mary Ann, he can contort and mangle his body to escape his bonds, impressing Mary Ann, who declares her love for him before leaving to restore order amongst the foosa.\n\n===Dorothy===\nDorothy (voiced by [[Sarah Thyre]]) is a [[mongoose lemur]] who is the wife of Ted. She appears to be at about the same intelligence level of her husband. Dorothy is sweet, caring, and possibly good at cooking. She is a minor character throughout all the series. In the episode \"Diapers are the New Black\", Dorothy and Ted start creating fraud diapers to make a profit. This leads to Julien getting upset that another brand is stealing customers, so he and Ted get in a competition of diaper-making.

Their marriage is revealed in the third series.\n\nIn season 5, Dorothy is bored with Ted's indecisive nature and ask Dr S' help to bring out Ted's more manly alter-ego, Snake. However, Snake is revealed to be rather simple-minded and crude, and at the end Dorothy is happy to get her husband back.\n\n===Pancho===\nPancho (voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) is a [[crowned lemur]]. He is mentioned in \"Poll Position\" when Xixi mentions him in her report stating that he is looking cozy for he's canoodling with a new lemur lady and questions if love is in the air. King Julien agrees that he hopes so and states that \"Pancho needs it.\"\nIn Season 4, it is revealed in 'The Panchurian Candidate' that Uncle King Julien uses mind-washing to condition Pancho as the perfect assassin, for the scenario if he is ever deposed. Unaware of this, Pancho is activated when he hears the trigger word, to kill King Julien. Thanks to Clover and Maurice, the assassination is averted, but Pancho remains ill at ease and paranoid after this experience.\nIn Exiled, when King Julien and Maurice have to flee the kingdom, they escape in a nuclear submarine piloted by Pancho, who was preparing for this scenario due to his paranoia. Later, he sabotages the blimp of the Russian chimps at King Julien's orders, and is thrown out of the blimp as a result. He is revealed to have survived though.\nPancho is known as a felon (which according to him is written with a \"ph\") to other lemurs, who keep their distance from him.\nIn Season 5, Pancho's skills with explosives are often used when destruction is needed, though he often tends to go overboard with violent solutions to problems.\n\n===Sage Moondancer===\nSage Moondancer (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a buff and spiritualistic [[Indri|lemur]]. He tends to speak in spiritualist, hippie-like sentences nobody seems to understand. Despite his great strength and fighting skills, he is a devoted pacifist. He and Clover have a complicated romantic relationship - he is drawn to her but often feels threatened by her aggressiveness. Sage has made lifelong a bond with a great eagle, who comes to his aid or to carry him off when it's needed; he can call him via squawking at any time.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Exiled\" that Sage is from the warlike kingdom of the Mountain Lemurs - he left because he disagrees with their conquering, oppressing ways and chose spiritual peace. Unfortunately, in his absence, his evil brother Koto took over the kingdom and conquered King Julien's lemurs and all neighboring kingdoms. Sage goes on a quest with Clover to get help, asking for assistance from his mentor, an enigmatic but seemingly crazy mudskipper named Jarsh-Jarsh. In the end, Sage and Clover bond as they realize after a body-swapped experience that they are the perfect weapon, able to balance each other out. Sage defeats Koto in combat, but at Clover's request spares his life (though he is squashed under his own statue anyway when he tries to backstab Sage).\n\nIn season 5, Sage has to leave King Julien's kingdom to lead his people as their new king, relocating them back to their ancient kingdom. In episode 12, he engages to Crimson, but ends up realizing that Clover is the life-long mate he was always searching for. In episode 13, Sage asks King Julien to bury him during his bachelor party so he can meditate. As the king forgets to mark the spot, they cannot locate Sage the next day, leading to a fake Sage being made by Dr. S., but the real Sage arrives at the wedding eventually and marries Clover.\n\n===Tammy===\nTammy (voiced by [[Debra Wilson]]) is a [[common brown lemur]] who is the mother of Todd and the wife of Butterfish. While she loves her son, she tends to pressure him. She is domineering and in every competition tries to push Todd into the foreground, even cheating if it is necessary. Unlike most lemurs, she does not respect King Julien at all.\n\n===Butterfish===\nButterfish (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a lemur who is the husband of Tammy and the father of Todd.\n\n===Todd===\nTodd (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a [[common brown lemur]] who is the son of Tammy and Butterfish. He is a child prodigy according to his mother, but being forced to perform in every competition seems to have taken a toll on him. Todd is often nervous and has a tic, and when he snaps he can be a terrifying force which can even frighten Mountain lemurs. He and Mort are often rivals because of their similar size, and because his mother often tries to make Todd replace Mort.\n\n===Timo===\nTimo (voiced by Chris Miller in ''Madagascar'', [[David Krumholtz]] in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a [[tenrec]] [[scientist]] who is an expert on technology.\n\nKing Julien first encountered Timo in \"He Blinded Me with Science\" where he replaced the batteries in King Julien's boom box after it ran out of power during King Julien's dance to get the Sky God Kevin to bring rain to his kingdom. Upon introducing Timo to the lemurs, King Julien had them receive the technology that was salvaged from Timo's area. The lemurs get hooked on the technology until a power surge happened that destroyed Timo's generator and started a fire. With help from Masikura, King Julien, Maurice, Mort, Clover, and Timo were able to find ground water to help stop the fire.\nIn \"Viva Mort\", Timo invented a device that would help King Julien to make him embarrassed as a way to make it up to Maurice. Due to the device not being plugged in, Maurice was put through the device and embarrassed instead.\nIn \"The Really Really Big Lie,\" King Julien asks Timo to build a giant mechanical gecko to make it believable to cover his lie. The robot gecko went on a rampage, leaving the kingdom in a panic. Timo says that the off switch is on the bunny ears because Todd loves bunnies. King Julien, Maurice, and Clover managed to shut down the mechanical gecko and escaped from a fall.\n\nIn \"One More Cup,\" King Julien, Maurice, and Mort find a bag of coffee beans and take it to Timo, who made a coffee machine. King Julien drinks the coffee and feels the energy. King Julien and Timo sells the coffee to the lemurs that Julien calls \"Brown Julien\".\n\nIn King Julien Superstar, Timo helped King Julien and the gang become famous superstars by \"tuning\" their voices to sound good.<ref>Watching All Hail King Jullien</ref>\n\nIn Exiled, Timo is absent during the takeover of the country by Koto's army, because he is trapped in his home by the domineering Mom-Bot he has built. Extremely possessive of her \"son\", Mom-Bot constantly berates Timo and wants to control all aspects of his life - it is only with Mort's help that he is able to shut her down and reprogram her. Afterwards, Timo helps Mort bring out Smart Mort, and builds a gate to Morticus Khan's dimension as per his plans.\n\nIn Season 5, Timo builds pipes to dump all the sewage into the watering hole as per King Julien's orders - which he then blames him for, leading Clover to arrest him. Later, he builds a pump to funnel the sewage underground, with disastrous results.\n\n===Mom-Bot===\nBuilt by Timo, Mom-Bot (voiced by [[David Krumholtz]]) is a domineering mother figure robot who somewhat resembles an owl, and speaks with a Jewish accent and always offers to bake traditional Jewish cookies to people. She is also armed to the teeth with lasers, rockets and built-in weaponry. Timo built him to be a supporting mother figure to himself, but her programming was glitchy and she basically imprisoned Timo, doting on him constantly, belittling his achievements, and berating him for not having a girlfriend or having a good job. When Mort visits, he is also captured and forced to stay, but they eventually manage to disable Mom-Bot and Timo reprograms her to be less manic - though she still tends to be doting. She helps the two build the portal to Morticus Khan's dimension, where the Khan attacks and dismembers Mom-Bot, reducing her to a head. \nIn Season 5, Mom-Bot is still just a head, though Timo carries her around when she has to go somewhere.\n\n===King Joey===\nKing Joey (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) is a [[Malagasy giant rat|jumping rat]] who is the ruler of Madagascar's jumping rats. Like his kind, King Joey is not very bright.\n\n===Clumsy Pete===\nClumsy Pete appeared once, in the episode \"The Jungle Games\". During spear throwing, he failed miserably, causing Xixi to state that King Joey should have put in Efficient Charlie. During harpoon shooting, Clover and Crimson get in a fight, causing them to get eliminated and give the round to Clumsy Pete and the rats by default. But while Clumsy Pete mumbled about which button it is to shoot, he hit his own leg. He was out for the Jungle Games and was never seen or mentioned again.\n\n===Efficient Charlie===\nEfficient Charlie, unlike the rest of is kingdom, was surprisingly bright. He was said to always get jobs done. In the episode \"True Bromance\", when Maurice left the lemur kingdom because he was mad at King Julien, he says that he wished Julien would disappear. Since King Joey was not bright, he thought that Maurice wanted Julien killed. Joey put Lazy Dougie on the job, but Efficient Charlie was put in after Dougie overslept. Charlie was seen preparing to throw Julien off a cliff when Maurice arrived and rescued him. Efficient Charlie was not seen again, but he was mentioned in the episode 'The Jungle Games' when Xixi said that Charlie should have been in during spear throwing instead of Clumsy Pete.\n\n===Lazy Dougie===\nLazy Dougie was a member of the rat kingdom. He was shown to be very lazy. He only appears once in the episode \"True Bromance\". He was supposed to have murdered King Julien, but he instead put Efficient Charlie on the job due to him oversleeping. Dougie was not seen or mentioned ever again.\n\n===Becca===\nBecca (voiced by [[Sarah Thyre]] in a Southern accent) is a red/orange-eyed [[black lemur]] who is Abner's wife. Becca and Abner encountered King Julien in his alias of \"Banana Guy Mike\" where he had helped them fix their watering hole. She and her husband vowed to get King Julien off his throne to avenge the \"death\" of Banana Guy Mike. They remain strong opposers of King Julien and consider themselves a resistance movement, albeit they are very inept and know not much about the democracy they fight for.\nIn \"Viva Mort,\" Becca and Abner have started the Lemur Alliance Liberation Army (LALA) to get revenge on King Julien. They duped Mort into helping them until their movement was discovered by Clover. Though Becca and Abner are thwarted, Clover had to leave to keep King Julien from getting stung by a scorpion that was placed in a package that they had Mort give to him.\nIn a later episode, they and Hector decide to rid the kingdom of all \"unwanted elements\", via catapulting them outside the walls they built. This eventually leads to only them staying in the kingdom.\n\n===Abner===\nAbner (voiced by [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in ''Madagascar'', [[Diedrich Bader]] in a Southern accent in ''All Hail King Julien'') is a blue-eyed lemur who is Becca's husband and is not very bright. Abner and Becca encountered King Julien in his alias of \"Banana Guy Mike\" where he had helped them with their powers. He and his wife vowed to get King Julien off his throne to avenge the \"death\" of Banana Guy Mike.\n\nIn Madagascar, he is only seen in the paradise scene, serving drinks and later watching Alex do his performance. In \"Viva Mort,\" Abner and Becca have started the Lemur Alliance Liberation Army (LALA) to get revenge on King Julien. They duped Mort into helping them until their movement was discovered by Clover. Though Abner and Becca are thwarted, Clover had to leave to keep King Julien from getting stung by a scorpion that was placed in a package that they had Mort give to him.\n\n===Karl===\nKarl (voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]) is a devious [[Malagasy civet|fanaloka]]. He is a card-carrying villain (literally) who took it upon himself to become the arch-nemesis of King Julien. Known for his theatrics and love of over-complicated plans, Karl is the kind of villain who rather \"arches\" his nemesis than to actually kill him. It is revealed eventually that he blames Julien for the way he treated him in high school. He is always encountered with his pet hissing cockroach, Chauncey, who is actually his one true friend and companion as well. He tends to make dramatic getaways when thwarted, announcing \"This is not over - not yet, at least.\"\n\nAfter he did some attempts on King Julien's life where Mort took a blow to every attempt, Karl makes himself known to King Julien and invites him to his lair with the directs on the brochure. After Clover and Maurice are captured, King Julien makes his way to Karl's lair at a crashed zeppelin where Karl mentions his plans to raise the zeppelin and take over the world with King Julien as his partner. While Karl was ranting about his plans, King Julien manages to free Clover and Maurice. When King Julien, Clover, and Maurice exit the zeppelin, they are confronted by Karl who prepares to fire a laser at him until the balloon carrying the rocks with every wishes that the lemurs wrote on them for the Sky God member Frank falls from the sky and lands on Karl. Seeing his \"Surprise Me\" wish roll against him, King Julien took it as a sign that Frank had helped him defeat Karl.\n\nIn \"One More Cup,\" it is revealed that Karl survived and returned where he hooked the whole kingdom on caffeine which was part of his plan. He states he watches King Julien fooling around in the Cove of Wonders instead of following his kingly duties. Karl threw a bag of coffee beans in the ocean and knew that Julien would find it because it has the word \"king\" on it. The hyper kingdom threw out King Julien, Maurice, and Clover. With the help of Mort (who became intelligent from the coffee), they plan to destroy Karl's coffee supply. They approach to Karl's zeppelin while Smart Mort walks through the fields where he meets jumping rats working there. Karl returns, finding them, and tries to destroy them when the jumping rats break through the door demanding a raise from their boss, even the ones cornering Julien, Maurice, and Clover. Later, Karl surrounds the group and prepares to fire his incinerator at Julien until Smart Mort bites him on the foot. King Julien has the weapon and sees that Karl has Mort in his clutches and says that he has one shot, him or Mort. Julien, having no choice, aims the incinerator at the fields destroying the crops leaving Karl devastated worrying what will Bruce will say when he returns from his vacation. King Julien now aims the laser at Karl who states that it charges. Karl escapes in a hot balloon with Chauncey driving it. Karl vows that he will return and will never stop getting rid of King Julien.\n\nIn \"Are You There Frank? It's Me, Julien,\" Karl creates a special armor that allows him to pose as Frank the Sky God in order to get the Lemurs to oppose Frank's brother Larry the Volcano God by sacrificing King Julien. With help from Mort operating the Larry armor that Timo built, King Julien repels Karl. in \"Revenge of the Prom\", Karl reveals that he was in all of Julien's old high school classes, but Julien never noticed him.\n\nIn Exiled, Karl unexpectedly saves King Julien and offers to help him take back his kingdom - if only to destroy him later himself. However, King Julien accidentally destroys Karl's super-weapon, the Karl-Star, and they are both captured by Koto.\n\nIn Season 5, it is revealed Karl's older and domineering brother Bruce has a successful coffee business, and he wants to partner with King Julien - but he ends up buying out Julien and spreading his coffee shops everywhere. Clover and Maurice ally with Karl, who hates his brother for bullying him, and together they ruin his company. At the end it is revealed this was Karl's plan all along, he knew King Julien would cause Bruce's downfall.\n\nIn \"Karlmaggedon\", Karl decides to retire and announces to leave his role as King Julien's arch-nemesis to whoever wins the contest - with Fairfax and Pancho, Tammy and Butterfish, Mort and his Grandpa, and King Julien and Clover contesting for the role (the latter figuring he can be his own nemesis). This all turns out to be a ruse, to keep Julien busy while Karl prepares his ultimate weapon, the Karl-Star to destroy Madagascar with lasers. However, at King Julien's signal, the lemurs use mirrors to make the Karl-Star blow itself up. Julien reveals he expected this from Karl as he always kept bragging about his penchant for using lasers. Defeated, Karl makes good on his promise to retire and travels to Florida with Chauncey on a hot air balloon, admitting that there are no \"not yet, at leasts\" this time.\n\n====Chauncey====\nChauncey (vocal effects provided by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]] who is Karl's pet and henchman. Chauncey spies on King Julien and reports anything he hears to Karl. In the episode \"The Jungle Rooster\", King Julien managed to convince Chauncey to join his side. Eventually, Karl tells Chauncey he would never choose Mary Ann over him and they become best friends again.\n\n===Crimson===\nCrimson (voiced by [[India de Beaufort]]) a red-furred blue-eyed [[crowned lemur]] who is the twin sister of Clover and is the opposite of her. Crimson leaves a trail of destruction everywhere she goes and she wants to marry and then murder King Julien, then move on to another lemur to do the same thing. She even seduces Sage at one point, though only briefly. Later, she allies with Uncle King Julien, aiding him in trying to win his throne back in return for later favors. While competing against Clover in the olympic games, she shows that she still has feelings for her sister when she helps her win. \nIn Exiled, she seems to have abandoned her old boss and moved to an island inhabited with female lemurs, capturing travelers to sacrifice them to a tentacle beast.\nIn Season 5 episode 12, Clover is expecting Sage to propose to her, and is shocked to find that Sage is inviting her to his wedding - to Crimson! Clover tries her best to still be supportive to her friend, and eventually Sage comes to the realization he wants to spend with life with Clover, not Crimson. In episode 13, Crimson shows up during the wedding preparations at the insistence of her ghostly grandmother Rose. She admits to Clover that she was always jealous of her being more successful, and hence tried to prove herself by taking away the things Clover gained - like Sage. Clovers forgives her and the sisters reconcile, with Crimson leading Clover to the altar at the wedding. At the end it is shown she still has not given up on wooing King Julien, though he is not falling for her tricks anymore.\n\n===Rob McTodd (Nurse Phantom)===\nRob McTodd (voiced by [[David Koechner]]) is a lemur who was King Julien's old friend. Maurice never liked Rob as he was a bad influence on Julien, and eventually Uncle King Julien had him banished. Rob returns years later to reconcile, but secretly plans revenge - revealing that he has aged and lost his good looks, he plans to transplant Julien's face to his own. Julien still likes Rob and reconciles with him, and while he has taken up odd habits, such as hibernating in a cave, he seems to have adjusted fine to the changes. Rob now calls himself Nurse Phantom and serves as the assistant to Dr S. - his now deformed face and mannerisms a homage to the Phantom of the Opera. During Exiled, he works with Mort to organize the resistance against Koto.\nIn Season 5, Robb is seemingly restored to his original appearance, only to suddenly be crushed to death in a series of unlikely accidents after warning King Julien that something weird is going on. However it is revealed later that like everyone else, he was replaced with a robot duplicate by Karl. In the last episode, he plays Igor to Dr S. when they create a fake Sage for the wedding.\n\n===Vigman Wildebeests===\nVigman Wildebeests (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a cocky [[blue wildebeest]], he was a rival of Clover's grandmother. In the episode 'Eye of Clover\", he enters the tournament and defeats every player. However he is defeated by Clover when he falls into the Pit of Doom. He is often seen in scenes taking place in Heaven, where he has a rematch against Clover's grandmother Rose.\n\n===Dr. S===\nDr. S (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a cobra who works as a self-taught underworld doctor. Though it takes work to get a doctor's license, Dr. S' claim is that he can't get busted if he practices medicine in his own cave. He was brought to the kingdom by Rob who wanted to use him in his revenge plot, but after reconciling with Julien, the king let them stay. Dr S, while quite the mad scientist, has helped King Julien out in a lot of strange cases with his questionable \"science\" - even bringing the dead to life at one time. He also likes to experiment on willing (and unwilling) subjects, though without much maliciousness. His catchphrase is shouting \"Operating out of a CAAAVEEE!\" which is always accompanied by lightning and thunder.\n\n===Fred the Giant Scorpion===\nFred the Giant Scorpion (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) is a giant scorpion that lives in the desert parts of Madagascar. He apparently had a \"personal problem\" of eating babies, but has reformed. When Clover makes up a story that unfortunately features Fred as the villain (not knowing that he actually exists), it riles him up enough to attack the kingdom. In Exiled, Fred is revealed to have become a guru for a self-help cult. As Clover and Sage are caught up in the cult's brainwashing, they are approached by Fred, who wants out\u2014it is revealed that he just wanted a quick scam but people believed his fake teachings so much, he could not leave. In the end Clover successfully breaks her indoctrination and makes the cult disband, but Pam and Fred quickly start another quick money-making scheme again. In Season 5, Fred shows up for the wedding of Sage and Clover, though he has no dialogue.\n\n===Pam Simonsworthington===\nPam Simonsworthington, voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], is a ridiculously fast lemur who wears goggles. She is a female [[ring-tailed mongoose]]. She first appeared in the episode \"The King and Mrs. Mort\". Since King Julien was being hospitalized, Mort was temporarily the king. Pam arrived at the kingdom and told Mort, who pretended to be Julien, that she was a judge for a contest of which kingdom was the best. Mort showed her around the kingdom nervously. Near the end of the episode, Maurice and Clover do some investigating and find out the truth about Pam. She was a manipulator who ran from kingdom to kingdom marrying kings, robbing the kingdom, and running off. Clover attacks Pam, but she uses her speed to beat Clover up. At the very end, Maurice and Clover round up some kings of other kingdoms, and Clover screams out some of Pam's nicknames like Stephanie Jeeves or Lilly Teeterwagon. The crocodile ambassador complains to Pam, to which she states that he couldn't even give her a proper massage. King Joey just looks confused as usual, and Pam says that he was the easiest one. The shark king complains in shark language. Knowing that she has been caught, Pam uses her super speed to run away. But she is caught in a net trap that Clover made and temporarily captured. The next time she is seen is in the episode \"Cult Fiction\", and she has changed quite a bit. She has apparently given up her job on manipulating kings and is now part of a fake cult that Fred the giant scorpion created. Clover and Sage, who are looking for a weapon that will save the kingdom from Koto and the mountain lemurs, watch a bit. Sage wants to leave, but Clover is sucked in because all of Fred's fake wise words make so much sense to her. Clover's enthusiasm lead to Pam putting her on a higher rank. One night, Fred tells Clover and Sage that everything is fake and he needs their help to escape. They agree, but Clover changes her mind and captures Fred and Sage. But she changes her mind again after a message from Jarsh-Jarsh in a dream and instead deprograms the cult-addicted minds of everyone. Pam however quickly suggests a get-rich scheme to Fred and they start another cult again.\nIn Season 5, Pam shows up disguised as King Julien's popularity manager, Eloise. When King Julien starts \"Facewall\" (a parody of Facebook), and gets obsessed who gets more \"Fleeks\" (likes), Eloise steers him to change his views and entourage to be more liked by his people. This causes Julien to hire Todd to his \"posse\", and fire Clover and Maurice to replace them by a puppet operated by Pancho. However, as the puppet becomes more popular than him, soon the people choose to elect it instead of him, with a disguised Pam planning to marry the puppet and become queen. Clover and Maurice find out though that her \"polls\" were based on asking oblivious children or heavily manipulated. Clover knocks out Eloise, revealing her to be Pam - the first time Clover actually beat her in combat. Pam admits she did not even want the crown anyway, considering the people were stupid enough to elect a puppet. She is locked in jail, and immediately hits on the also imprisoned Pancho.\nPam's personality is very cocky, and she has a loud laugh. Overall, she is not as evil as someone like Koto, but she is still not a very nice person due to her penchant for thievery and manipulation.\n\n===Jarsh-Jarsh===\nJarsh-Jarsh (voiced by [[JB Blanc]]) is a [[mudskipper]] and Sage's mentor. When first encountered by Clover, he seemed to be only able to say his name and spit mud at her and waddle on the ground. After testing Clover's (very tenuous) patience this way, he revealed a map that would lead them to the ultimate weapon. In the end it was revealed to have been another of Jarsh-Jarsh's tests itself. Jarsh-Jarsh then body-swapped Sage and Clover, which lead to Sage experiencing anger and rage, he beat up his mentor when Jarsh-Jarsh mocked him - until Clover, in Sage's body, intervened. Jarsh-Jarsh then revealed that this was the final test all along - so each of them understands the other and their anger and calmness balance themselves out. In Season 5, Jarsh-Jarsh shows up in the last episode, attending Sage and Clover's wedding - Sage had to pick him up as he does not travel by hawk, causing him to be late to his wedding.\n\n===Koto===\nKoto (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) is a mountain lemur, and Sage's brother. He is the antithesis of his sibling - cruel, domineering, aggressive and manipulative. First appearing at the end of Season 4, Koto is rescued from a snake by King Julien, who shows him around the kingdom - little suspecting that Koto was simply scouting ahead for a kingdom to take over. At the end of the season, Koto arrives with his mountain lemur army and conquers King Julien's kingdom, as well as the neighbouring ones like the rats or the crocodiles. He takes Julien's crown and enslaves the people, forcing them to work on his statue.\n\nIn ''Exiled'', Koto has to deal with the underground rebellion started by Mort, who eventually escapes. Sage also gives one last try to reconcile with his brother by reminding them of their childhood bond, but Koto mocks his sentiments. When King Julien returns, having raised an army from the friends encountered during his voyage, they are initially successful, but Julien is forced to surrender to save his friends. Koto plans to force Clover into marriage, and execute King Julien at the wedding - however an attack led by Maurice and Mort saves them. Koto has a showdown with his brother Sage, who defeats him but spares his life at Clover's request. Koto tries to backstab King Julien anyway, which causes his statue to collapse on top of him, ending his reign of terror. In Season 5, Koto is shown in Frankri-La with the Pineapple and all the characters who died in the series.\n\n===Zora===\nA female mountain lemur who arrived with Koto but fell in love with Mort during ''Exiled''. She marries him in Season 5 but they later break up. Later, Uncle King Julien falls in love with her and she's smitten with him. He renounces his evil ways for her and they leave together.\n\nThe two show up again in the last episode, attending Clover and Sage's wedding.\n\n===Grandpa Mort===\nGrandpa Mort (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a wizened old mouse lemur. Though Mort only has vague memories of him, he indeed seems to be his grandfather, but was imprisoned decades ago due to conspiring against one of King Julien's ancestors. Grandpa Mort shows up in \"Karlmaggedon\" to offer one of the golden mangoes to Mort, so they can join the contest to become the new nemesis of King Julien. It is revealed at the end of the contest that he only wants to make Mort turn to evil, as is in his blood, and help him fulfill his destiny of destroying King Julien. When Mort refuses, Grandpa Mort reveals the Mort family line always absorbs the essence of the weaker ones, hence ensuring only the most evil remain, and attempts to do the same to Mort. While he succeeds, he then suddenly explodes, with Mort absorbing his essence instead.\n\n===Captain Ethan===\nCaptain Ethan (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is a rat who is the leader of the pirates that operate in the waters of Madagascar.\n\n===Lil' Arms Magee===\nLil' Arms Magee (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) was a crocodile that worked for Captain Ethan. Magee, along with One-Eyed Simon and No Name Jack, worked for Ethan's crew of pirates that operated the waters near Madagascar. Magee was first seen in the episode \"O' Captain my Captain-Part 1\". His crew was sparring while King Julien, who had just gotten captured, watched. At the end, Jimmy was thrown overboard due to his lack of fighting skills. Throughout the three episodes that Magee appeared in, he was shown to have tiny arms just like the rest of his kind, and that resulted in stress. For example, when Julien tried to escape, he told Magee that there was a contest to see who could give Ethan the best hug. Magee is sad because he realizes that he would never win. But Julien offers to coach him only because he thinks he can grab the key to the jail cell. Out of all the pirates, Magee was shown to always have the most support for Julien. When Julien became captain and asked pirates questions about what they did, Magee and the other pirates sang him a song. Later, when Mort and Clover invaded to rescue Julien, Magee attacked them along with his mates. Magee was shown to have been knocked out by Clover along with Simon and jack. But later, the pirates woke up and chased down Julien, Mort, and Clover. Ethan was knocked out though, and Julien charmed the rest of the pirates with mangoes and got them to sail away. In the episode 'The Love Gauntlet,', when Karl and Chauncey's plan to drown Julien and his parents in a volcano failed, Karl recruited the pirates to attack them. But Ethan missed Julien on a charge and drowned in the volcano, and Julien charmed the rest of the pirates with trophies to chase Karl and Chauncey away. Magee and his mates decided to give Julien's parents a ride back to their island later, and Magee was never seen nor mentioned ever again.\n\n===Horton===\nHorton is not a well-known character. He is a lemur of the kingdom. Horton appeared once, in the episode \"Diapers are the New Black\". He is wearing a diaper, and he and other lemurs are making fun of diaper-less lemurs like Ted and Dorothy. Horton is laughing at them, but a few seconds later, his diaper has been stolen. Ted is accused, and a big fight breaks out. Horton's name is revealed when Clover tells King Julien and Maurice that someone stole his diaper. He is never seen or mentioned again.\n\n===Jeffrey===\nJeffrey is a random lemur of the kingdom. He has no lines. He appeared in the episode \"Fast Food Lemur Nation\". Jeffrey is not a well-known character. His name is revealed when King Julien says hi to him while he, along with the whole kingdom, was being magnetized by a gigantic magnet. Jeffrey is the same color as most of the kingdom, which is light gray. His status is unknown because he is never seen or mentioned again after that.\n\n===Andy Fairfax===\nAndy Fairfax (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) is a bat who is involved in trickery, particularly to sell things. In the episode \u201cGet Off My Lawn,\u201d he slyly sells all the lemurs in the kingdom protection scorpions, leaving Clover without a job. He is seen in many episodes selling things to unknowing people, like a comfort Mort in \u201cJulien 2.0.\u201d He and Pancho are often seen together robbing houses, as seen in \u201cThe All Hail King Julien Show.\u201d Often he uses his charming personality to fool others.
