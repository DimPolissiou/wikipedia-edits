The engineering and construction supervision work of the stadium was performed by [[ACE Moharram Bakhoum]]. Before becoming an all seater stadium, it had the ability to hold over 100,000 spectators, reaching a record of 120,000. It is the foremost Olympic-standard facility befitting the role of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] as the center of events in the region. It is also the 69th largest stadium in the world. Located in [[Nasr City]]; a suburb north east of [[Cairo]], it was completed in 1960, and was inaugurated by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|President Gamal Abd El Nasser]] on 23 July that year, the eighth anniversary of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]. [[Zamalek SC]] and [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] use [[Cairo International Stadium]] for most of their home games.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Stadium is located about 10&nbsp;km west of [[Cairo International Airport]] and about 10&nbsp;km<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g.co/maps/qa5bd |title=Distance &amp; Directions from Cairo Stadium to Downtown |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> (30 min) from downtown Cairo.\n\nIn 2005, in preparation for the [[2006 African Cup of Nations]] it underwent a major renovation, and was brought up to 21st century world standard along with all its multi-game Olympic facilities.\n\nCairo Stadium is known for its tremendous atmosphere and its very large capacity. This was never more evident than during the [[2006 African Cup of Nations]], which were held in Egypt. When Egypt had their matches in Cairo Stadium, the stadium seemed to nearly erupt.\nBefore seats were added to all sections in 2005, the stadium was notorious for holding more people than it was intended to. Without seats, fans were able to squeeze together and sit in aisles. Because of the previous seating layout, Cairo International Stadium was able to host over 120,000 fans for the 1986 African Cup of Nations Final match between Egypt and Cameroon. Behind the enormous crowd, hosts Egypt defeated Cameroon.\n\nCairo Stadium is a strong symbol of Egyptian football. Nearly all of the most important Egyptian matches are held there. It carries an extremely rich history which includes many memorable football moments that range from Hossam Hassan's famous header to secure Egypt's attendance in Italia 90 World Cup, numerous African Cup of Nations tournaments which included the latest 2006 trophy, and the famous derby matches between Ahly and Zamalek.\n\nIt has also served as the main stadium of the [[1991 All-Africa Games]].\n\n==2019 Africa Cup of Nations==\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]].\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the 2019  Africa Cup of

web|url=http://www.cairo-stadium.org.eg/articlesdetail.aspx?id=N10|title=International Cairo Stadium|website=www.cairo-stadium.org.eg|access-date=2017-02-11}}</ref> The architect of the stadium is the German [[Werner March]], who had built from 1934 to 1936 the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] in Berlin. Before becoming an all seater stadium, it had the ability to hold over 100,000 spectators, reaching a record of 120,000. It is the foremost Olympic-standard facility befitting the role of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] as the center of events in the region. It is also the 69th largest stadium in the world. Located in [[Nasr City]]; a suburb north east of [[Cairo]], it was completed in 1960, and was inaugurated by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|President Gamal Abd El Nasser]] on 23 July that year, the eighth anniversary of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]. [[Zamalek SC]] and [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] use [[Cairo International Stadium]] for most of their home games.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Stadium is located about 10&nbsp;km west of [[Cairo International Airport]] and about 10&nbsp;km<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g.co/maps/qa5bd |title=Distance &amp; Directions from Cairo Stadium to Downtown |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> (30 min) from downtown Cairo.\n\nIn 2005, in preparation for the [[2006 African Cup of Nations]] it underwent a major renovation, and was brought up to 21st century world standard along with all its multi-game Olympic facilities.\n\nCairo Stadium is known for its tremendous atmosphere and its very large capacity. This was never more evident than during the [[2006 African Cup of Nations]], which were held in Egypt. When Egypt had their matches in Cairo Stadium, the stadium seemed to nearly erupt.\nBefore seats were added to all sections in 2005, the stadium was notorious for holding more people than it was intended to. Without seats, fans were able to squeeze together and sit in aisles. Because of the previous seating layout, Cairo International Stadium was able to host over 120,000 fans for the 1986 African Cup of Nations Final match between Egypt and Cameroon. Behind the enormous crowd, hosts Egypt defeated Cameroon.\n\nCairo Stadium is a strong symbol of Egyptian football. Nearly all of the most important Egyptian matches are held there. It carries an extremely rich history which includes many memorable football moments that range from Hossam Hassan's famous header to secure Egypt's attendance in Italia 90 World Cup, numerous African Cup of Nations tournaments which included the latest 2006 trophy, and the famous derby matches between Ahly and Zamalek.\n\nIt has also served as the main stadium of the [[1991 All-Africa Games]].\n\n==2019 Africa Cup of Nations==\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]].\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the 2019  Africa Cup of Nations:\n\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Time ([[Central European Summer Time|CEST]])\n!Team #1\n!Result\n!Team

A credit card also differs from a [[cash card]], which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe size of most credit cards is {{convert|85.60|\u00d7|53.98|mm|in|frac=8}} and rounded corners with a radius of {{convert|2.88|\u2013|3.48|mm|in|frac=80}}<!-- =1/8\"\u00b110% --><ref>ISO/IEC 7810:2003, clause 5, Dimensions of card</ref> conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1|ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1]] standard, the same size as [[ATM card]]s and other [[payment card]]s, such as [[debit card]]s.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31432 ISO/IEC 7810:2003 ''Identification cards \u2014 Physical characteristics'']</ref>\n\nCredit cards have a printed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/ca/merchant/en/solutions/unembossed.html|title=For Merchants - MasterCard Unembossed|work=MasterCard}}</ref> or embossed [[bank card number]] complying with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard. The card number's ''prefix'', called the [[Bank Identification Number]] (known in the industry as a BIN<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-identification-number.asp |title=Bank Identification Number (BIN)}}</ref>), is the sequence of digits at the beginning of the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nBoth of these standards are maintained and further developed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1]]. Credit cards have a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7813]]. Many modern credit cards have a [[EMV|computer chip]] embedded in them as a security feature.\n\nIn addition to the main credit card number, credit cards also carry issue and expiration dates (given to the nearest month), as well as extra codes such as issue numbers and [[Card Security Code|security codes]]. Not all credit cards have the same sets of extra codes nor do they use the same number of digits.\n\nCredit card numbers were originally embossed to allow easy transfer of the number to charge slips. With the decline of paper slips, some credit cards are no longer embossed and in fact the card number is no longer in the front.<ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunaway|first1=Jaime|title=Why Are Credit Card Numbers on the Back Now?|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/04/why-are-credit-card-numbers-on-the-back-of-the-card-now.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=18 April 2018}}\u0111\u00e1o h\u1ea1n th\u1ebb t\u00edn d\u1ee5ng\n\n==History==\n\n===Edward Bellamy's ''Looking Backward''===\nThe concept of using a card for purchases was described in 1887 by [[Edward Bellamy]] in his utopian novel ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Bellamy used the term ''credit card'' eleven times in this novel, although this referred to a card for spending a [[citizen's dividend]] from the government, rather than borrowing,<ref>(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and three times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, ''Equality''</ref> making it more similar to a [[debit card]].\n\n===Charge coins, medals, and so on===\nCharge coins and other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with materials made out of [[celluloid]] (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, and other types of whitish metals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-collectible-coins-charge-plate-1264.php|title=Life before plastic: Historical look at credit card materials|work=creditcards.com}}</ref> Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.\n\nThe charge coin offered a simple and fast way to copy a charge account number to the sales slip, by imprinting the coin onto the sales slip. This sped the process of copying, previously done by [[handwriting]]. It also reduced the number of errors, by having a standardized form of numbers on the sales slip, instead of various kinds of handwriting style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com/2013/03/charge-coins-come-to-retro-boston.html|title=Shopping Days In Retro Boston|author=Charles Boston|work=shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause the customer's name was not on the charge coin, almost anyone could use it. This sometimes led to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally, by acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning in the 1930s, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/charge-cards.html|title=The Department Store Museum: Charge Cards|work=departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n===Early charge cards===\n====Charga-Plate====\nThe Charga-Plate, developed in 1928, was an early predecessor of the credit card and was used in the U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a {{convert|2+1/2|\u00d7|1+1/4|in|mm|adj=on}} rectangle of sheet metal related to [[Addressograph]] and military [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]] systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state<!-- Yes, no street address -->. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper \"charge slip\" positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an [[typewriter ribbon|inked ribbon]] against the charge slip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Credit_Card_Imprinter |title=Credit card imprinter |publisher=Cultureandcommunication.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/215/668/55263/|title=Hartford Charga-plate Associates, Incorporated, Plaintiff-appellant, v.

In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.\n\n===={{anchor|Air Travel Card}}Air Travel Card====\nIn 1934, [[American Airlines]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] simplified the process even more with the advent of the [[Universal Air Travel Plan|Air Travel Card]].<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Travel Card that gave \"CREDIT\" to the public |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIHl--RuqkC&pg=PA11 |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=June 1953 |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=11 |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern [[Universal Air Travel Plan|UATP]] cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could \"buy now, and pay later\" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines. By the 1940s, all of the major U.S. airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines. By 1941, about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air. In October 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first internationally valid charge card within all members of the [[International Air Transport Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcardprocessingspace.com/history-of-the-credit-card/ |title=History Of The Credit Card |publisher=www.creditcardprocessingspace.com |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Early general purpose charge cards: Diners Club, Carte Blanche, and American Express====\nThe concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and [[Frank X. McNamara|Frank McNamara]], founders of [[Diners Club]], to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first \"general purpose\" [[charge card]] and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement. That was followed by [[Carte Blanche (credit card)#Carte Blanche|Carte Blanche]] and in 1958 by [[American Express]] which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later acquired credit card features).\n\n===BankAmericard and Master Charge===\n[[File:Mastercharge_and_Bankamericard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal signs at a plant nursery in Los Angeles County, California marketing Mastercharge and Bankamericard]]\nUntil 1958, no one had been able to successfully establish a ''revolving credit'' financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched the ''BankAmericard'' in [[Fresno, California]], which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card.<ref name=pricenomics>{{cite web|last1=Mayyasi|first1=Alex|title=How Credit Cards Tax America|url=http://priceonomics.com/how-credit-cards-tax-america/|website=Pricenomics}}</ref> It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]. In 1966, the ancestor of [[MasterCard]] was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when [[Citibank]] merged its own [[Everything Card]], launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.\n\nEarly credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass-produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. They have been mailed off to unemployable people, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant [[Betty Furness]] found very like \"giving sugar to [[diabetics]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Neill, Paul | title = A Little Gift from Your Friendly Banker | journal = [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] | date = 27 April 1970}}</ref> These mass mailings were known as \"drops\" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, approximately 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings.\n\nBefore the computerization of credit card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 under the leadership of [[Dee Hock]], the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute.<ref name=\"pricenomics\" />  However, until always-connected [[payment terminal]]s became ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone.  Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card.   Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.\n\n===Development outside North America===\nThe fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who were traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.\n\nIn 1966, [[Barclaycard]] in the [[United Kingdom]] launched the first credit card outside the United States.\n\nAlthough credit cards reached very high adoption levels in the US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as [[Carte Bleue|Carte bleue]] or the [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]] (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. [[Debit card]]s and [[online banking]] (using either [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s or PCs{{clarify|date=August 2015}}) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low as the use of a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and [[Australia]]'s [[Bankcard]]. [[Japan]] remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as [[telephone cards]]) are used as [[Telephone token|alternative currencies]], the trend is toward [[RFID]]-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.\n\n===Vintage, old, and unique credit cards as collectibles===\n[[File:Credit card receipt - old style.jpg|right|thumb|Receipt from 1997 - card physically swiped and information imprinted on the receipt]]\nThe design of the credit card itself has become a major selling point in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-latest-american-status-symbol-metal-credit-cards-2017-04-25|title=Metal credit cards: The latest American status symbol|last=LaMagna|first=Maria|work=MarketWatch|access-date=7 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's financial worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and [[Affinity credit card|Affinity]] cards, where the card design is related to the \"affinity\" (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage of the value of the card is returned to the affinity group.\n\nA growing field of [[numismatics]] (study of money), or more specifically [[exonumia]] (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even [[metal]] tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards. Early credit cards were made of [[celluloid]] plastic, then metal and [[fiber]], then paper, and are now mostly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) plastic.\nHowever the chip part of credit cards is not made from plastic but from metals.\n\n==Usage==\nA credit card issuing company, such as a bank or credit union, enters into agreements with merchants for them to accept their credit cards. Merchants often advertise which cards they accept by displaying [[acceptance mark]]s \u2013 generally derived from logos \u2013 or this may be communicated in signage in the establishment or in company material (e.g., a restaurant's menu may indicate which credit cards are accepted). Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in \"We take (brands X, Y, and Z)\" or \"We don't take credit cards\".\n\n[[File:Credit card logos (2015-12-1816-27-350044).jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|[[Visa credit card|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]] are card-issuing entities that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.]]\nThe credit card issuer issues a credit card to a customer at the time or after an account has been approved by the credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a [[receipt]] with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a [[card not present transaction]] (CNP).\n\n[[Electronics|Electronic]] [[Credit card verification|verification]] systems allow merchants to verify in a few seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a [[credit card terminal|credit card payment terminal]] or [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] or [[Smart card|chip]] on the card; the latter system is called [[Chip and PIN]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], and is implemented as an [[EMV]] card.\n\nFor [[card not present transaction]]s where the card is not shown (e.g., [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], [[mail order]], and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that the customer is in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the [[Card Security Code|security code]] printed on the back of the card, date of expiry, and billing address.\n\nEach month, the cardholder is sent a statement indicating the purchases made with the card, any outstanding fees, the total amount owed and the minimum payment due. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see {{USC|15|1643}}, which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The [[Fair Credit Billing Act]] gives details of the U.S. regulations.\n\nMany banks now also offer the option of electronic statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's [[online banking]] website. Notification of the availability of a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.\n\n===Minimum payment===\nThe cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges [[interest]] on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a [[late fee]] or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.\n\nIn cases where the minimum payment is less than the finance charges and fees assessed during the billing cycle, the outstanding balance will increase in what is called [[negative amortization]]. This practice tends to increase credit risk and mask the lender's portfolio quality, and consequently has been banned in the U.S. since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2003/20030108/attachment.pdf|title=Credit Card Lending}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/minimum-credit-card-payments-1267.php|title=Understanding how credit card minimum payments are set}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising, solicitation, application and approval===\nCredit card advertising regulations in the U.S. include the [[Schumer box]] disclosure requirements. A large fraction of junk mail consists of credit card offers created from lists provided by the major [[credit reporting agency|credit reporting agencies]]. In the United States, the three major U.S. credit bureaus ([[Equifax]], [[TransUnion]] and [[Experian]]) allow consumers to opt out from related credit card solicitation offers via its [[Optoutprescreen.com|Opt Out Pre Screen]] program.\n\n===Interest charges===\nCredit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.\n\nFor example, if a user had a $1,000 transaction and repaid it in full within this grace period, there would be no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB).  Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).\n\nThe credit card may simply serve as a form of [[revolving credit]], or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage [[balance transfer]]s from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. [[Interest rate]]s can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card ''or any other credit instrument'', or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Grace period===\nA credit card's grace period is the time the cardholder has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days depending on the type of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.\n\nUsually, if a cardholder is late paying the balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred depend on the grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period if there is any outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.\n\n===Parties involved===\n* Cardholder: The holder of the card used to make a purchase; the [[consumer]].\n* Card-issuing bank: The financial institution or other organization that issued the credit card to the cardholder. This bank bills the consumer for repayment and bears the risk that the card is used fraudulently. American Express and Discover were previously the only card-issuing banks for their respective brands, but as of 2007, this is no longer the case. Cards issued by banks to cardholders in a different country are known as [[offshore credit card]]s.\n* Merchant: The individual or business accepting credit card payments for products or services sold to the cardholder.\n* [[Acquiring bank]]: The financial institution accepting payment for the products or services on behalf of the merchant.\n* [[Independent sales organization]]: Re-sellers (to merchants) of the services of the acquiring bank.\n* [[Merchant account]]: This could refer to the acquiring bank or the independent sales organization, but in general is the organization that the merchant deals with.\n* [[Card association]]: An association of card-issuing banks such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa (company)|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], etc. that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.\n* Transaction network: The system that implements the mechanics of the electronic transactions. May be operated by an independent company, and one company may operate multiple networks.\n* Affinity partner: Some institutions lend their names to an issuer to attract customers that have a strong relationship with that institution, and get paid a fee or a percentage of the balance for each card issued using their name. Examples of typical affinity partners are sports teams, universities, charities, professional organizations, and major retailers.\n* Insurance providers: Insurers underwriting various insurance protections offered as credit card perks, for example, Car Rental Insurance, Purchase Security, Hotel Burglary Insurance, Travel Medical Protection etc.\n\nThe flow of information and money between these parties \u2014 always through the card associations \u2014 is known as the interchange, and it consists of a few steps.\n\n===Transaction steps===\n* '''[[Authorization hold|Authorization]]''': The cardholder presents the card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank). The acquirer verifies the credit card number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.\n* '''Batching''': Authorized transactions are stored in \"batches\", which are sent to the acquirer. Batches are typically submitted once per day at the end of the business day. If a transaction is not submitted in the batch, the authorization will stay valid for a period determined by the issuer, after which the held amount will be returned to the cardholder's available credit (see [[authorization hold]]). Some transactions may be submitted in the batch without prior authorizations; these are either transactions falling under the merchant's [[floor limit]] or ones where the authorization was unsuccessful but the merchant still attempts to force the transaction through. (Such may be the case when the cardholder is not present but owes the merchant additional money, such as extending a hotel stay or car rental.)\n* '''Clearing and Settlement''': The acquirer sends the batch transactions through the credit card association, which debits the issuers for payment and credits the acquirer. Essentially, the issuer pays the acquirer for the transaction.\n* '''Funding''': Once the acquirer has been paid, the acquirer pays the merchant. The merchant receives the amount totaling the funds in the batch minus either the \"discount rate\", \"mid-qualified rate\", or \"non-qualified rate\" which are tiers of fees the merchant pays the acquirer for processing the transactions.\n* '''Chargebacks''': A [[chargeback]] is an event in which money in a merchant account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder. In the event of a chargeback, the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the chargeback to the merchant, who must either accept the chargeback or contest it.\n\n=== Credit card register ===\nA credit card register is a transaction register used to ensure the increasing balance owed from using a credit card is enough below the credit limit to deal with authorization holds and payments not yet received by the bank and to easily look up past transactions for reconciliation and budgeting.\n\nThe register is a personal record of banking transactions used for credit card purchases as they affect funds in the bank account or the available credit. In addition to check number and so forth the code column indicates the credit card. The balance column shows available funds after purchases.  When the credit card payment is made the balance already reflects the funds were spent. In a credit card's entry, the deposit column shows the available credit and the payment column shows total owed, their sum being equal to the credit limit.\n\nEach check written, debit card transaction, cash withdrawal, and credit card charge is entered manually into the paper register daily or several times per week.<ref>Little, Ken. 2007.

Credit cards are accepted in larger establishments in almost all countries, and are available with a variety of credit limits, repayment arrangements. Some have added perks (such as insurance protection, [[Loyalty program|rewards schemes]] in which points earned by purchasing goods with the card can be redeemed for further [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Cashback reward program|cashback]]).\n\n===Consumers' limited liability===\nSome countries, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], limit the amount for which a consumer can be held [[Legal liability|liable]] in the event of fraudulent transactions with a lost or stolen credit card.\n\n==Specialized types==\n\n===Business credit cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nBusiness credit cards are specialized credit cards issued in the name of a registered business, and typically they can only be used for business purposes. Their use has grown in recent decades. In 1998, for instance, 37% of small businesses reported using a business credit card; by 2009, this number had grown to 64%.<ref name=FedReport>{{cite web|title=Report to the Congress on the Use of Credit Cards by Small Businesses and the Credit Card Market for Small Businesses|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/sbc_smallbusinesscredit.pdf|website=Federal Reserve|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\nBusiness credit cards offer a number of features specific to businesses. They frequently offer special rewards in areas such as shipping, office supplies, travel, and business technology. Most issuers use the applicant's personal [[credit score]] when evaluating these applications. In addition, income from a variety of sources may be used to qualify, which means these cards may be available to businesses that are newly established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/5-business-credit-card-myths-can-cost-business-109526-1.html|title=5 Business Credit Card Myths That Can Cost Your Business {{!}} AllBusiness.com|date=21 December 2016|work=AllBusiness.com|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> In addition, most major issuers of these cards do not report account activity to the owner's personal credit unless there is a default.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This may have the effect of protecting the owner's personal credit from the activity of the business.\n\nBusiness credit cards are offered by almost all major card issuers\u2014like American Express, Visa, and MasterCard in addition to local banks and credit unions. Charge cards for businesses, however, are currently only offered by American Express.\n\n===Secured credit cards===\nA secured credit card is a type of credit card secured by a [[deposit account]] owned by the cardholder. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500\u20131,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special [[savings deposit|savings account]]. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.\n\nThe cardholder of a secured credit card is still expected to make regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering the cost of the purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.\n\nAlthough the deposit is in the hands of the credit card issuer as security in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.\n\nMost of these conditions are usually described in a cardholder agreement which the cardholder signs when their account is opened.\n\nSecured credit cards are an option to allow a person with a poor [[credit history]] or no credit history to have a credit card which might not otherwise be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.\n\nSometimes a credit card will be secured by [[home equity|the equity in the borrower's home]].\n\n===Prepaid cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nA \"prepaid credit card\" is not a true credit card,<ref name=\"fcac\"/> since no credit is offered by the card issuer: the cardholder spends money which has been \"stored\" via a prior deposit by the cardholder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], or [[Japan Credit Bureau|JCB]]) and can be used in similar ways just as though it were a credit card.<ref name=\"fcac\"/> Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an [[EMV]] chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via [[Chip and PIN]] technology.\n\nAfter purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.<ref name=\"fcac\">{{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084013/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archivedate=7 March 2007| title=Credit Cards and You \u2013 About Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| accessdate=9 January 2008}} document: {{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf| title=Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| format=PDF| accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229122947/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nPrepaid credit cards are sometimes marketed to teenagers<ref name=\"fcac\"/> for shopping online without having their parents complete the transaction.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302185119/http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/11433 \"Buy prepaid credit cards without an ID or age limits?

As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to [[bankruptcy]]. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed.<ref>{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/default-penalty-rates-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-1276.php |title=Credit card penalty rates can top 30 percent; how to avoid them |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases [[universal default]] may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This can lead to a snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit.

Most simply display the [[acceptance mark]]s (stylized logos, shown in the upper-left corner of the sign) of all the cards they accept.]]\nFor [[merchants]], a credit card transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as [[cheque]]s, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.\n\nPrior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's [[credit history]] before extending credit. That task is now performed by the banks which assume the [[credit risk]]. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer does not have enough cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.\n\nFor each purchase, the bank charges the merchant a commission (discount fee) for this service and there may be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).\n\n===Costs to merchants===\nMerchants are charged several fees for accepting credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] of around 1 to 4 percent of the value of each transaction paid for by credit card.<ref name=gensler2013>{{Citation\n |last=Gensler |first=Lauren |date=April 2013 |title=You (Probably) Won't Pay More to Swipe |magazine=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |publication-place=New York |page=14}}</ref> The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction.<ref name=how/> In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the [[profit margin]] or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction.

Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their [[monopoly power]] to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the [[National Retail Federation]] and major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]]. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.<ref name=washpost />\n\nMerchants are also required to lease or purchase processing equipment, in some cases this equipment is provided free of charge by the [[Payment processor|processor]]. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated. In many cases, there is a delay of several days before funds are deposited into a merchant's bank account. Because credit card fee structures are very complicated, smaller merchants are at a disadvantage to analyze and predict fees.\n\nFinally, merchants assume the risk of [[chargebacks]] by consumers.\n\n==Security==\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\n{{See also|Wireless identity theft}}\n\nCredit card security relies on the physical security of the plastic card as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It is now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature (for magnetic stripe cards). A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.\n\nThe [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS) is the security standard issued by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] (PCI SSC). This data security standard is used by acquiring banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.\n\nThe goal of the credit card companies is not to eliminate fraud, but to \"reduce it to manageable levels\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thrive Business Solutions |url=http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |title=PCI Compliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305093414/http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |archivedate=5 March 2008}}</ref> This implies that fraud prevention measures will be used only if their cost are lower than the potential gains from fraud reduction, whereas high-cost low-return measures will not be used \u2013 as would be expected from organizations whose goal is profit maximization.\n\n[[Internet fraud]] may be by claiming a [[chargeback]] which is not justified (\"[[friendly fraud]]\"), or carried out by the use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either [[online]] or [[Off-line|offline]]. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.\n\n[[Controlled payment number]]s (also known as virtual credit cards or disposable credit cards) are another option for protecting against credit card fraud where presentation of a physical card is not required, as in telephone and online purchasing. These are one-time use numbers that function as a payment card and are linked to the user's real account, but do not reveal details, and cannot be used for subsequent unauthorised transactions. They can be valid for a relatively short time, and limited to the actual amount of the purchase or a limit set by the user. Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it a second time.\n\nA similar system of controls can be used on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin [[EMV]] countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there are security features present on the physical card itself in order to prevent [[counterfeiting]]. For example, most modern credit cards have a [[watermark]] that will fluoresce under [[Wood's lamp|ultraviolet light]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Counterfeit Detection |url=https://www.fraudfighter.com/hs-fs/hub/76574/file-1552643545-pdf |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Most major credit cards have a [[hologram]]. A Visa card has a letter V superimposed over the regular Visa logo and a MasterCard has the letters MC across the front of the card. Older Visa cards have a bald eagle or dove across the front. In the aforementioned cases, the security features are only visible under ultraviolet light and are invisible in normal light.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice]], [[United States Secret Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] are responsible for prosecuting criminals who engage in [[credit card fraud]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Identity Theft and Identity Fraud |url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/identity-theft/identity-theft-and-identity-fraud |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> However, they do not have the resources to pursue all criminals, and in general they only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000.\n\nThree improvements to card security have been introduced to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant [[smart card]]s which are intended to make [[forgery]] more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the [[EMV]] (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit [[card security code]] (CSC) is now present on the back of most cards, for use in [[card not present transaction]]s. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the [[Secure POS Vendor Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Secure POS Vendor Alliance is launched by Hypercom, Ingenico and VeriFone |url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |publisher=ECommerce Journal |year=2009 |postscript= |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033905/http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |archivedate=26 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\n===Code 10===\nCode 10 calls are made when merchants are suspicious about accepting a credit card.\n\nThe operator then asks the merchant a series of YES or NO questions to find out whether the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder.

The merchant may receive a reward for returning a confiscated card to the issuing bank, especially if an arrest is made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/code.html |title=Code 10 |accessdate=28 November 2012 |publisher=[[Visa Inc.]] |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115112909/http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/code.html |archivedate=15 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/uk/merchant/en/security/datasecurityrules/card_id_sec_features.html|title=MasterCard Card Identification Features|accessdate=28 November 2012|publisher=[[MasterCard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernetwork.com/common/pdf/CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.pdf|title=CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.PDF|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Discover Card]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513202211/http://www.discovernetwork.com/common/pdf/CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.pdf|archive-date=13 May 2008|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/ca/en/merchant/pdfs/final-fraud-prevention-quick-guide%20-en.pdf|title=American Express Fraud Prevention Handbook|last=|first=|date=|website=American Express|publisher=[[American Express]]|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Costs and revenues of credit card issuers ==\n===Costs===\n====Charge offs====\nWhen a cardholder becomes severely delinquent on a debt (often at the point of six months without payment), the creditor may declare the debt to be a [[charge-off]]. It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports. ([[Equifax]], for instance, lists \"R9\" in the \"status\" column to denote a charge-off.)\n\nA charge-off is considered to be \"written off as uncollectible\". To banks, bad debts and fraud are part of the cost of doing business.\n\nHowever, the debt is still legally valid, and the creditor can attempt to collect the full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside [[collection agency]]. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500\u20132,000), there is the possibility of a lawsuit or [[arbitration]].\n\n====Fraud====\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\nIn relative numbers the values lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 dollars worth of transactions (7 [[basis point]]s).<ref>[http://issaasad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mercator-fraud-1208.pdf Credit Card Issuer Fraud Management, Report Highlights, December, 2008]</ref> In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over \u00a3500 million.<ref>[http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109 Plastic fraud loss on UK-issued cards 2004/2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616211917/http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109|date=16 June 2006}}. [[Cardwatch.org.uk]]. site retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund some or all of the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.\n\nMost banking services have their own credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or [[Cards and Unsecured Business]]. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. [[Credit card fraud]] is a major white collar crime that has been around for many decades, even with the advent of the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.\n\n====Interest expenses====\nBanks generally borrow the money they then lend to their customers. As they receive very low-interest loans from other firms, they may borrow as much as their customers require, while lending their capital to other borrowers at higher rates. If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan. This 10% difference is the \"net interest spread\" and the 5% is the \"interest expense\".\n\n====Operating costs====\nThis is the [[operating cost|cost of running]] the credit card portfolio, including everything from paying the executives who run the company to printing the plastics, to mailing the statements, to running the computers that keep track of every cardholder's balance, to taking the many phone calls which cardholders place to their issuer, to protecting the customers from fraud rings. Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also a significant portion of expenses.\n\n====Rewards====\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:CreditCard-AU-Qantas-Cobrands.jpg|right|thumb|[[Qantas Frequent Flyer]] co-branded credit cards]] -->\nMany credit card customers receive rewards, such as [[frequent flyer]] points, gift certificates, or [[Cashback reward program|cash back]] as an incentive to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, which may or may not include [[balance transfer]]s, [[Payday loan|cash advances]], or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the [[breakage]] in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.\n\n===Revenues===\n\n====Interchange fee====\n{{Main|Interchange fee}}\n\nIn addition to fees paid by the card holder, merchants must also pay [[interchange fee]]s to the card-issuing bank and the card association.<ref name=\"S-1\">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000119312507242653/ds1.htm United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1], 9 November 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Tampa Tribune\">[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ Debit Cards Cash In On Rewards Riches] ''Tampa Tribune'', 15 February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228043408/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ |date=28 February 2008 }}</ref> For a typical credit card issuer, interchange fee revenues may represent about a quarter of total revenues.<ref name=\"FRB\"/>\n\nThese fees are typically from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary not only from merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates<ref name=\"FRB\">[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics] James Lyon, 19 January 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322001627/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm |date=22 March 2008 }}</ref>), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use [[cash]], [[debit card]]s, or even [[cheque]]s.\n\n====Interest on outstanding balances====\n[[Credit card interest|Interest]] charges vary widely from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are \"teaser\" rates in effect for initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can be as high as 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the interest or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as [[South Dakota]], having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example [[Delaware]], have very weak [[usury|usury laws]]. The [[teaser rate]] no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.\n\n==Fees charged to customers==\nThe major '''credit card fees''' are for:\n*Cash advances and convenience cheques (often 3% of the amount)\n* Charges that result in exceeding the credit limit on the card (whether deliberately or by mistake), called over-limit fees\n* Exchange rate loading fees (sometimes these might not be reported on the customer's statement, even when applied).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|title=credit cards abroad|last=Gracia|first=Mike|date=9 May 2008|publisher=creditchoices.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612170006/http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|archivedate=12 June 2008|url-status = dead|accessdate=9 May 2008}}\n</ref> The variation of exchange rates applied by different credit cards can be very substantial, as much as 10% according to a [[Lonely Planet]] report in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|title=Comparison of exchange rates using Visa and Diners Club cards in Bali|date=3 March 2010|publisher=Lonelyplanet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711041436/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|archivedate=11 July 2011|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n* Late or overdue payments\n* Membership fees (annual or monthly), sometimes a percentage of the credit limit.\n*Returned cheque fees or payment processing fees (e.g. phone payment fee)\n* Transactions in a foreign currency (as much as 3% of the amount). A few financial institutions do not charge a fee for this.\n\nIn the U.S., the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] specifies that credit card companies must send cardholders a notice 45 days before they can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board: Credit Card Rules|publisher=U.S. Federal Reserve Board|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106014436/http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk_creditcardrules.htm|archivedate=6 January 2014|url-status = dead|accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nOne controversial area is the [[trailing interest]] issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. U.S. Senator [[Carl Levin]] raised the issue of millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/senate_credit_cards02.html|title=Credit Card Executives Tough Out Senate Hearing|author=Joseph S.

Although the federal [[Truth in Lending Act]] provisions that prohibited surcharges expired that year, a number of states have since enacted laws that continue to outlaw the practice; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas have laws against surcharges. As of 2006, the United States probably had one of the world's highest if not the top ratio of credit cards per capita, with 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard credit card and debit card accounts alone for an adult population of roughly 220 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_|title=US Census: 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200212055921/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_|archivedate=12 February 2020|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> The credit card per U.S. capita ratio was nearly 4:1 as of 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalscoreindex.com/ViewAllGraphs.aspx|title=Experian's National Score Index|publisher=Nationalscoreindex.com|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> and as high as 5:1 as of 2006.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207|title=Prime Numbers: The Plastic Revolution|date=19 February 2008|magazine=Foreign Policy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115110602/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207|archivedate=15 January 2009|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Over-limit charges==\n===United Kingdom===\nConsumers who keep their account in good order by always staying within their credit limit, and always making at least the minimum monthly payment will see interest as the biggest expense from their card provider.

Profiting from a customer's mistakes is arguably not permitted under UK common law, if the charges constitute penalties for breach of contract, or under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].\n\nSubsequent rulings in respect of personal current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the [[Office of Fair Trading]]'s ruling it seems unlikely that any further test case will take place.\n\nWhilst the law remains in the balance, many consumers have made claims against their credit card providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest that they would have earned had the money not been deducted from their account. It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of \u00a312 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's \u00a312 threshold level are more contentious.\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] requires that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into over-limit fees, presenting this as a benefit as it may avoid the possibility of a future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging over-limit fees. Whether a customer opts into the over-limit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an over-limit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how long it would take them to pay off the balance.\n\n==Neutral consumer resources==\n\n===Canada===\nThe Government of Canada maintains a database of the fees, features, interest rates and reward programs of nearly 200 credit cards available in Canada. This database is updated on a quarterly basis with information supplied by the credit card issuing companies. Information in the database is published every quarter on the website of the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).\n\nInformation in the database is published in two formats. It is available in [[PDF]] comparison tables that break down the information according to type of credit card, allowing the reader to compare the features of, for example, all the student credit cards in the database.\n\nThe database also feeds into an interactive tool on the FCAC website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |title=FCAC - Interactive Tools - Credit Card Selector Tool |work=FCAC |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221014248/http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}</ref> The interactive tool uses several interview-type questions to build a profile of the user's credit card usage habits and needs, eliminating unsuitable choices based on the profile, so that the user is presented with a small number of credit cards and the ability to carry out detailed comparisons of features, reward programs, interest rates, etc.\n\n==Credit cards in ATMs==\n[[File:ATM 750x1300.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Acceptance mark at an [[automated teller machine]] ]]\nMany credit cards can be used in an [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] to withdraw money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer [[debit card cashback|cashback]] on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.\n\nMany credit card companies will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, at the end of a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.\n\n===Acceptance mark===\nAn ''acceptance mark'' is a logo or design that indicates which card schemes an ATM or [[merchant]] accepts. Common uses include decals and signs at merchant locations or in merchant advertisements. The purpose of the mark is to provide the card holder with information where his or her card can be used. An acceptance mark differs from the a card product name (such as [[Centurion Card|American Express Black card]], [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]]), as it shows the card scheme (group of cards) accepted. An acceptance mark however corresponds to the card scheme mark shown on a card.\n\nAn acceptance mark is however not an absolute guarantee that all cards belonging to a given card scheme will be accepted. On occasion cards issued in a foreign country may not be accepted by a merchant or ATM due to contractual or legal restrictions.\n\n==Credit cards as funding for entrepreneurs==\nCredit cards are a risky way for [[entrepreneur]]s to acquire capital for their start ups when more conventional financing is unavailable. [[Len Bosack]] and [[Sandy Lerner]] used personal credit cards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |title=A start-up's true tale |publisher=Pdp10.nocrew.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> to start [[Cisco Systems]]. [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]]'s start up of [[Google]] was financed by credit cards to buy the necessary computers and office equipment, more specifically \"a terabyte of [[hard disks]]\".<ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Google About Page under 1998] page retrieved 30 May 2007.{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}}</ref> Similarly, filmmaker [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] financed part of ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' using credit cards.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093200/trivia Hollywood Shuffle trivia at IMDB] page retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> Director [[Kevin Smith]] funded ''[[Clerks]]'' in part by maxing out several credit cards.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kevin Smith: how we made Clerks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/07/how-we-made-clerks-kevin-smith |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Actor [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] also financed his production of ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming]]'' partly through his credit cards. Famed hedge fund manager [[Bruce Kovner]] began his career (and, later on, his firm [[Caxton Associates]]) in financial markets by borrowing from his credit card. UK entrepreneur [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]] (as seen on ''[[Dragons' Den]]'') financed his first business using several credit cards.\n\n==Problems==\nTravelers from the U.S. had encountered problems abroad because many countries have introduced [[smart card]]s, but the U.S. had not. {{As of|2010}}, the U.S. banking system had not updated the cards and associated readers in the U.S., stating that the costs were prohibitive.

A credit card also differs from a [[cash card]], which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe size of most credit cards is {{convert|85.60|\u00d7|53.98|mm|in|frac=8}} and rounded corners with a radius of {{convert|2.88|\u2013|3.48|mm|in|frac=80}}<!-- =1/8\"\u00b110% --><ref>ISO/IEC 7810:2003, clause 5, Dimensions of card</ref> conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1|ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1]] standard, the same size as [[ATM card]]s and other [[payment card]]s, such as [[debit card]]s.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31432 ISO/IEC 7810:2003 ''Identification cards \u2014 Physical characteristics'']</ref>\n\nCredit cards have a printed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/ca/merchant/en/solutions/unembossed.html|title=For Merchants - MasterCard Unembossed|work=MasterCard}}</ref> or embossed [[bank card number]] complying with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard. The card number's ''prefix'', called the [[Bank Identification Number]] (known in the industry as a BIN<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-identification-number.asp |title=Bank Identification Number (BIN)}}</ref>), is the sequence of digits at the beginning of the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nBoth of these standards are maintained and further developed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1]]. Credit cards have a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] conforming to the [[ISO/IEC 7813]]. Many modern credit cards have a [[EMV|computer chip]] embedded in them as a security feature.\n\nIn addition to the main credit card number, credit cards also carry issue and expiration dates (given to the nearest month), as well as extra codes such as issue numbers and [[Card Security Code|security codes]]. Not all credit cards have the same sets of extra codes nor do they use the same number of digits.\n\nCredit card numbers were originally embossed to allow easy transfer of the number to charge slips. With the decline of paper slips, some credit cards are no longer embossed and in fact the card number is no longer in the front.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunaway|first1=Jaime|title=Why Are Credit Card Numbers on the Back Now?|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/04/why-are-credit-card-numbers-on-the-back-of-the-card-now.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Edward Bellamy's ''Looking Backward''===\nThe concept of using a card for purchases was described in 1887 by [[Edward Bellamy]] in his utopian novel ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Bellamy used the term ''credit card'' eleven times in this novel, although this referred to a card for spending a [[citizen's dividend]] from the government, rather than borrowing,<ref>(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and three times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, ''Equality''</ref> making it more similar to a [[debit card]].\n\n===Charge coins, medals, and so on===\nCharge coins and other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with materials made out of [[celluloid]] (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, and other types of whitish metals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-collectible-coins-charge-plate-1264.php|title=Life before plastic: Historical look at credit card materials|work=creditcards.com}}</ref> Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.\n\nThe charge coin offered a simple and fast way to copy a charge account number to the sales slip, by imprinting the coin onto the sales slip. This sped the process of copying, previously done by [[handwriting]]. It also reduced the number of errors, by having a standardized form of numbers on the sales slip, instead of various kinds of handwriting style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com/2013/03/charge-coins-come-to-retro-boston.html|title=Shopping Days In Retro Boston|author=Charles Boston|work=shoppingdaysinretroboston.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause the customer's name was not on the charge coin, almost anyone could use it. This sometimes led to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally, by acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning in the 1930s, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/charge-cards.html|title=The Department Store Museum: Charge Cards|work=departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n===Early charge cards===\n====Charga-Plate====\nThe Charga-Plate, developed in 1928, was an early predecessor of the credit card and was used in the U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a {{convert|2+1/2|\u00d7|1+1/4|in|mm|adj=on}} rectangle of sheet metal related to [[Addressograph]] and military [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]] systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state<!-- Yes, no street address -->. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper \"charge slip\" positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an [[typewriter ribbon|inked ribbon]] against the charge slip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Credit_Card_Imprinter |title=Credit card imprinter |publisher=Cultureandcommunication.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/215/668/55263/|title=Hartford Charga-plate Associates, Incorporated, Plaintiff-appellant, v.

In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.\n\n===={{anchor|Air Travel Card}}Air Travel Card====\nIn 1934, [[American Airlines]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] simplified the process even more with the advent of the [[Universal Air Travel Plan|Air Travel Card]].<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Travel Card that gave \"CREDIT\" to the public |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIHl--RuqkC&pg=PA11 |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=June 1953 |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=11 |access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern [[Universal Air Travel Plan|UATP]] cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could \"buy now, and pay later\" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines. By the 1940s, all of the major U.S. airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines. By 1941, about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air. In October 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first internationally valid charge card within all members of the [[International Air Transport Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditcardprocessingspace.com/history-of-the-credit-card/ |title=History Of The Credit Card |publisher=www.creditcardprocessingspace.com |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Early general purpose charge cards: Diners Club, Carte Blanche, and American Express====\nThe concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and [[Frank X. McNamara|Frank McNamara]], founders of [[Diners Club]], to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first \"general purpose\" [[charge card]] and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement. That was followed by [[Carte Blanche (credit card)#Carte Blanche|Carte Blanche]] and in 1958 by [[American Express]] which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later acquired credit card features).\n\n===BankAmericard and Master Charge===\n[[File:Mastercharge_and_Bankamericard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal signs at a plant nursery in Los Angeles County, California marketing Mastercharge and Bankamericard]]\nUntil 1958, no one had been able to successfully establish a ''revolving credit'' financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched the ''BankAmericard'' in [[Fresno, California]], which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card.<ref name=pricenomics>{{cite web|last1=Mayyasi|first1=Alex|title=How Credit Cards Tax America|url=http://priceonomics.com/how-credit-cards-tax-america/|website=Pricenomics}}</ref> It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]. In 1966, the ancestor of [[MasterCard]] was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when [[Citibank]] merged its own [[Everything Card]], launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.\n\nEarly credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass-produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. They have been mailed off to unemployable people, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant [[Betty Furness]] found very like \"giving sugar to [[diabetics]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Neill, Paul | title = A Little Gift from Your Friendly Banker | journal = [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] | date = 27 April 1970}}</ref> These mass mailings were known as \"drops\" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, approximately 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings.\n\nBefore the computerization of credit card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 under the leadership of [[Dee Hock]], the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute.<ref name=\"pricenomics\" />  However, until always-connected [[payment terminal]]s became ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone.  Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card.   Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.\n\n===Development outside North America===\nThe fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who were traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.\n\nIn 1966, [[Barclaycard]] in the [[United Kingdom]] launched the first credit card outside the United States.\n\nAlthough credit cards reached very high adoption levels in the US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as [[Carte Bleue|Carte bleue]] or the [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]] (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. [[Debit card]]s and [[online banking]] (using either [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s or PCs{{clarify|date=August 2015}}) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low as the use of a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and [[Australia]]'s [[Bankcard]]. [[Japan]] remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as [[telephone cards]]) are used as [[Telephone token|alternative currencies]], the trend is toward [[RFID]]-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.\n\n===Vintage, old, and unique credit cards as collectibles===\n[[File:Credit card receipt - old style.jpg|right|thumb|Receipt from 1997 - card physically swiped and information imprinted on the receipt]]\nThe design of the credit card itself has become a major selling point in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-latest-american-status-symbol-metal-credit-cards-2017-04-25|title=Metal credit cards: The latest American status symbol|last=LaMagna|first=Maria|work=MarketWatch|access-date=7 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's financial worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and [[Affinity credit card|Affinity]] cards, where the card design is related to the \"affinity\" (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage of the value of the card is returned to the affinity group.\n\nA growing field of [[numismatics]] (study of money), or more specifically [[exonumia]] (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even [[metal]] tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards. Early credit cards were made of [[celluloid]] plastic, then metal and [[fiber]], then paper, and are now mostly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) plastic.\nHowever the chip part of credit cards is not made from plastic but from metals.\n\n==Usage==\nA credit card issuing company, such as a bank or credit union, enters into agreements with merchants for them to accept their credit cards. Merchants often advertise which cards they accept by displaying [[acceptance mark]]s \u2013 generally derived from logos \u2013 or this may be communicated in signage in the establishment or in company material (e.g., a restaurant's menu may indicate which credit cards are accepted). Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in \"We take (brands X, Y, and Z)\" or \"We don't take credit cards\".\n\n[[File:Credit card logos (2015-12-1816-27-350044).jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|[[Visa credit card|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]] are card-issuing entities that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.]]\nThe credit card issuer issues a credit card to a customer at the time or after an account has been approved by the credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a [[receipt]] with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a [[card not present transaction]] (CNP).\n\n[[Electronics|Electronic]] [[Credit card verification|verification]] systems allow merchants to verify in a few seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a [[credit card terminal|credit card payment terminal]] or [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] or [[Smart card|chip]] on the card; the latter system is called [[Chip and PIN]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], and is implemented as an [[EMV]] card.\n\nFor [[card not present transaction]]s where the card is not shown (e.g., [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], [[mail order]], and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that the customer is in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the [[Card Security Code|security code]] printed on the back of the card, date of expiry, and billing address.\n\nEach month, the cardholder is sent a statement indicating the purchases made with the card, any outstanding fees, the total amount owed and the minimum payment due. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see {{USC|15|1643}}, which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The [[Fair Credit Billing Act]] gives details of the U.S. regulations.\n\nMany banks now also offer the option of electronic statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's [[online banking]] website. Notification of the availability of a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.\n\n===Minimum payment===\nThe cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges [[interest]] on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a [[late fee]] or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.\n\nIn cases where the minimum payment is less than the finance charges and fees assessed during the billing cycle, the outstanding balance will increase in what is called [[negative amortization]]. This practice tends to increase credit risk and mask the lender's portfolio quality, and consequently has been banned in the U.S. since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2003/20030108/attachment.pdf|title=Credit Card Lending}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/minimum-credit-card-payments-1267.php|title=Understanding how credit card minimum payments are set}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising, solicitation, application and approval===\nCredit card advertising regulations in the U.S. include the [[Schumer box]] disclosure requirements. A large fraction of junk mail consists of credit card offers created from lists provided by the major [[credit reporting agency|credit reporting agencies]]. In the United States, the three major U.S. credit bureaus ([[Equifax]], [[TransUnion]] and [[Experian]]) allow consumers to opt out from related credit card solicitation offers via its [[Optoutprescreen.com|Opt Out Pre Screen]] program.\n\n===Interest charges===\nCredit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.\n\nFor example, if a user had a $1,000 transaction and repaid it in full within this grace period, there would be no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB).  Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).\n\nThe credit card may simply serve as a form of [[revolving credit]], or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage [[balance transfer]]s from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. [[Interest rate]]s can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card ''or any other credit instrument'', or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Grace period===\nA credit card's grace period is the time the cardholder has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days depending on the type of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.\n\nUsually, if a cardholder is late paying the balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred depend on the grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period if there is any outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.\n\n===Parties involved===\n* Cardholder: The holder of the card used to make a purchase; the [[consumer]].\n* Card-issuing bank: The financial institution or other organization that issued the credit card to the cardholder. This bank bills the consumer for repayment and bears the risk that the card is used fraudulently. American Express and Discover were previously the only card-issuing banks for their respective brands, but as of 2007, this is no longer the case. Cards issued by banks to cardholders in a different country are known as [[offshore credit card]]s.\n* Merchant: The individual or business accepting credit card payments for products or services sold to the cardholder.\n* [[Acquiring bank]]: The financial institution accepting payment for the products or services on behalf of the merchant.\n* [[Independent sales organization]]: Re-sellers (to merchants) of the services of the acquiring bank.\n* [[Merchant account]]: This could refer to the acquiring bank or the independent sales organization, but in general is the organization that the merchant deals with.\n* [[Card association]]: An association of card-issuing banks such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa (company)|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], etc. that set transaction terms for merchants, card-issuing banks, and acquiring banks.\n* Transaction network: The system that implements the mechanics of the electronic transactions. May be operated by an independent company, and one company may operate multiple networks.\n* Affinity partner: Some institutions lend their names to an issuer to attract customers that have a strong relationship with that institution, and get paid a fee or a percentage of the balance for each card issued using their name. Examples of typical affinity partners are sports teams, universities, charities, professional organizations, and major retailers.\n* Insurance providers: Insurers underwriting various insurance protections offered as credit card perks, for example, Car Rental Insurance, Purchase Security, Hotel Burglary Insurance, Travel Medical Protection etc.\n\nThe flow of information and money between these parties \u2014 always through the card associations \u2014 is known as the interchange, and it consists of a few steps.\n\n===Transaction steps===\n* '''[[Authorization hold|Authorization]]''': The cardholder presents the card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (acquiring bank). The acquirer verifies the credit card number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.\n* '''Batching''': Authorized transactions are stored in \"batches\", which are sent to the acquirer. Batches are typically submitted once per day at the end of the business day. If a transaction is not submitted in the batch, the authorization will stay valid for a period determined by the issuer, after which the held amount will be returned to the cardholder's available credit (see [[authorization hold]]). Some transactions may be submitted in the batch without prior authorizations; these are either transactions falling under the merchant's [[floor limit]] or ones where the authorization was unsuccessful but the merchant still attempts to force the transaction through. (Such may be the case when the cardholder is not present but owes the merchant additional money, such as extending a hotel stay or car rental.)\n* '''Clearing and Settlement''': The acquirer sends the batch transactions through the credit card association, which debits the issuers for payment and credits the acquirer. Essentially, the issuer pays the acquirer for the transaction.\n* '''Funding''': Once the acquirer has been paid, the acquirer pays the merchant. The merchant receives the amount totaling the funds in the batch minus either the \"discount rate\", \"mid-qualified rate\", or \"non-qualified rate\" which are tiers of fees the merchant pays the acquirer for processing the transactions.\n* '''Chargebacks''': A [[chargeback]] is an event in which money in a merchant account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder. In the event of a chargeback, the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the chargeback to the merchant, who must either accept the chargeback or contest it.\n\n=== Credit card register ===\nA credit card register is a transaction register used to ensure the increasing balance owed from using a credit card is enough below the credit limit to deal with authorization holds and payments not yet received by the bank and to easily look up past transactions for reconciliation and budgeting.\n\nThe register is a personal record of banking transactions used for credit card purchases as they affect funds in the bank account or the available credit. In addition to check number and so forth the code column indicates the credit card. The balance column shows available funds after purchases.  When the credit card payment is made the balance already reflects the funds were spent. In a credit card's entry, the deposit column shows the available credit and the payment column shows total owed, their sum being equal to the credit limit.\n\nEach check written, debit card transaction, cash withdrawal, and credit card charge is entered manually into the paper register daily or several times per week.<ref>Little, Ken. 2007. ''Personal Finance At Your Fingertips'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=uPmUliMCKQwC&lpg=PA35&dq=personal%20credit%20card%20and%20debit%20card%20registers%20or%20transaction%20records&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=true p. 35] Penguin. {{ISBN|144062562X}}, 9781440625626</ref> Credit card register also refers to one transaction record for each credit card. In this case the booklets readily enable the location of a card's current available credit when ten or more cards are in use.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Features==\nAs well as convenient credit, credit cards offer consumers an easy way to track [[expense]]s, which is necessary for both monitoring personal expenditures and the tracking of work-related expenses for [[tax]]ation and [[reimbursement]] purposes. Credit cards are accepted in larger establishments in almost all countries, and are available with a variety of credit limits, repayment arrangements. Some have added perks (such as insurance protection, [[Loyalty program|rewards schemes]] in which points earned by purchasing goods with the card can be redeemed for further [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Cashback reward program|cashback]]).\n\n===Consumers' limited liability===\nSome countries, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], limit the amount for which a consumer can be held [[Legal liability|liable]] in the event of fraudulent transactions with a lost or stolen credit card.\n\n==Specialized types==\n\n===Business credit cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nBusiness credit cards are specialized credit cards issued in the name of a registered business, and typically they can only be used for business purposes. Their use has grown in recent decades. In 1998, for instance, 37% of small businesses reported using a business credit card; by 2009, this number had grown to 64%.<ref name=FedReport>{{cite web|title=Report to the Congress on the Use of Credit Cards by Small Businesses and the Credit Card Market for Small Businesses|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/sbc_smallbusinesscredit.pdf|website=Federal Reserve|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\nBusiness credit cards offer a number of features specific to businesses. They frequently offer special rewards in areas such as shipping, office supplies, travel, and business technology. Most issuers use the applicant's personal [[credit score]] when evaluating these applications. In addition, income from a variety of sources may be used to qualify, which means these cards may be available to businesses that are newly established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/5-business-credit-card-myths-can-cost-business-109526-1.html|title=5 Business Credit Card Myths That Can Cost Your Business {{!}} AllBusiness.com|date=21 December 2016|work=AllBusiness.com|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> In addition, most major issuers of these cards do not report account activity to the owner's personal credit unless there is a default.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This may have the effect of protecting the owner's personal credit from the activity of the business.\n\nBusiness credit cards are offered by almost all major card issuers\u2014like American Express, Visa, and MasterCard in addition to local banks and credit unions. Charge cards for businesses, however, are currently only offered by American Express.\n\n===Secured credit cards===\nA secured credit card is a type of credit card secured by a [[deposit account]] owned by the cardholder. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500\u20131,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special [[savings deposit|savings account]]. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.\n\nThe cardholder of a secured credit card is still expected to make regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering the cost of the purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.\n\nAlthough the deposit is in the hands of the credit card issuer as security in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.\n\nMost of these conditions are usually described in a cardholder agreement which the cardholder signs when their account is opened.\n\nSecured credit cards are an option to allow a person with a poor [[credit history]] or no credit history to have a credit card which might not otherwise be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.\n\nSometimes a credit card will be secured by [[home equity|the equity in the borrower's home]].\n\n===Prepaid cards===\n{{See also|Stored-value card}}\nA \"prepaid credit card\" is not a true credit card,<ref name=\"fcac\"/> since no credit is offered by the card issuer: the cardholder spends money which has been \"stored\" via a prior deposit by the cardholder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], or [[Japan Credit Bureau|JCB]]) and can be used in similar ways just as though it were a credit card.<ref name=\"fcac\"/> Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an [[EMV]] chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via [[Chip and PIN]] technology.\n\nAfter purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.<ref name=\"fcac\">{{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084013/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archivedate=7 March 2007| title=Credit Cards and You \u2013 About Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| accessdate=9 January 2008}} document: {{cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf| title=Pre-paid Cards| publisher=[[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]| format=PDF| accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229122947/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nPrepaid credit cards are sometimes marketed to teenagers<ref name=\"fcac\"/> for shopping online without having their parents complete the transaction.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302185119/http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/11433 \"Buy prepaid credit cards without an ID or age limits?

As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to [[bankruptcy]]. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed.<ref>{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/default-penalty-rates-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-1276.php |title=Credit card penalty rates can top 30 percent; how to avoid them |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases [[universal default]] may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This can lead to a snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates.

Most simply display the [[acceptance mark]]s (stylized logos, shown in the upper-left corner of the sign) of all the cards they accept.]]\nFor [[merchants]], a credit card transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as [[cheque]]s, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.\n\nPrior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's [[credit history]] before extending credit. That task is now performed by the banks which assume the [[credit risk]]. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer does not have enough cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.\n\nFor each purchase, the bank charges the merchant a commission (discount fee) for this service and there may be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).\n\n===Costs to merchants===\nMerchants are charged several fees for accepting credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] of around 1 to 4 percent of the value of each transaction paid for by credit card.<ref name=gensler2013>{{Citation\n |last=Gensler |first=Lauren |date=April 2013 |title=You (Probably) Won't Pay More to Swipe |magazine=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |publication-place=New York |page=14}}</ref> The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction.<ref name=how/> In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the [[profit margin]] or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a \"credit card supplement\" (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment by credit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips,_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |title=Example of a supplement chargeable to the customer when paying by credit card |publisher=Bmibaby.com |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708074413/http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips%2C_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}</ref> This practice was prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and credit card companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges.

Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their [[monopoly power]] to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the [[National Retail Federation]] and major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]]. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.<ref name=washpost />\n\nMerchants are also required to lease or purchase processing equipment, in some cases this equipment is provided free of charge by the [[Payment processor|processor]]. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated. In many cases, there is a delay of several days before funds are deposited into a merchant's bank account. Because credit card fee structures are very complicated, smaller merchants are at a disadvantage to analyze and predict fees.\n\nFinally, merchants assume the risk of [[chargebacks]] by consumers.\n\n==Security==\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\n{{See also|Wireless identity theft}}\n\nCredit card security relies on the physical security of the plastic card as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It is now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature (for magnetic stripe cards). A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.\n\nThe [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS) is the security standard issued by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] (PCI SSC). This data security standard is used by acquiring banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.\n\nThe goal of the credit card companies is not to eliminate fraud, but to \"reduce it to manageable levels\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thrive Business Solutions |url=http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |title=PCI Compliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305093414/http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 |archivedate=5 March 2008}}</ref> This implies that fraud prevention measures will be used only if their cost are lower than the potential gains from fraud reduction, whereas high-cost low-return measures will not be used \u2013 as would be expected from organizations whose goal is profit maximization.\n\n[[Internet fraud]] may be by claiming a [[chargeback]] which is not justified (\"[[friendly fraud]]\"), or carried out by the use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either [[online]] or [[Off-line|offline]]. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.\n\n[[Controlled payment number]]s (also known as virtual credit cards or disposable credit cards) are another option for protecting against credit card fraud where presentation of a physical card is not required, as in telephone and online purchasing. These are one-time use numbers that function as a payment card and are linked to the user's real account, but do not reveal details, and cannot be used for subsequent unauthorised transactions. They can be valid for a relatively short time, and limited to the actual amount of the purchase or a limit set by the user. Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it a second time.\n\nA similar system of controls can be used on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin [[EMV]] countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there are security features present on the physical card itself in order to prevent [[counterfeiting]]. For example, most modern credit cards have a [[watermark]] that will fluoresce under [[Wood's lamp|ultraviolet light]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Counterfeit Detection |url=https://www.fraudfighter.com/hs-fs/hub/76574/file-1552643545-pdf |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Most major credit cards have a [[hologram]]. A Visa card has a letter V superimposed over the regular Visa logo and a MasterCard has the letters MC across the front of the card. Older Visa cards have a bald eagle or dove across the front. In the aforementioned cases, the security features are only visible under ultraviolet light and are invisible in normal light.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice]], [[United States Secret Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] are responsible for prosecuting criminals who engage in [[credit card fraud]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Identity Theft and Identity Fraud |url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/identity-theft/identity-theft-and-identity-fraud |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> However, they do not have the resources to pursue all criminals, and in general they only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000.\n\nThree improvements to card security have been introduced to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant [[smart card]]s which are intended to make [[forgery]] more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the [[EMV]] (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit [[card security code]] (CSC) is now present on the back of most cards, for use in [[card not present transaction]]s. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the [[Secure POS Vendor Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Secure POS Vendor Alliance is launched by Hypercom, Ingenico and VeriFone |url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |publisher=ECommerce Journal |year=2009 |postscript= |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033905/http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone |archivedate=26 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\n===Code 10===\nCode 10 calls are made when merchants are suspicious about accepting a credit card.\n\nThe operator then asks the merchant a series of YES or NO questions to find out whether the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder.

It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports. ([[Equifax]], for instance, lists \"R9\" in the \"status\" column to denote a charge-off.)\n\nA charge-off is considered to be \"written off as uncollectible\". To banks, bad debts and fraud are part of the cost of doing business.\n\nHowever, the debt is still legally valid, and the creditor can attempt to collect the full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside [[collection agency]]. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500\u20132,000), there is the possibility of a lawsuit or [[arbitration]].\n\n====Fraud====\n{{Main|Credit card fraud}}\nIn relative numbers the values lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 dollars worth of transactions (7 [[basis point]]s).<ref>[http://issaasad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mercator-fraud-1208.pdf Credit Card Issuer Fraud Management, Report Highlights, December, 2008]</ref> In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over \u00a3500 million.<ref>[http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109 Plastic fraud loss on UK-issued cards 2004/2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616211917/http://www.cardwatch.org.uk/media.asp?sectionid=4&pageid=109|date=16 June 2006}}. [[Cardwatch.org.uk]]. site retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund some or all of the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.\n\nMost banking services have their own credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or [[Cards and Unsecured Business]]. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. [[Credit card fraud]] is a major white collar crime that has been around for many decades, even with the advent of the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.\n\n====Interest expenses====\nBanks generally borrow the money they then lend to their customers. As they receive very low-interest loans from other firms, they may borrow as much as their customers require, while lending their capital to other borrowers at higher rates. If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan. This 10% difference is the \"net interest spread\" and the 5% is the \"interest expense\".\n\n====Operating costs====\nThis is the [[operating cost|cost of running]] the credit card portfolio, including everything from paying the executives who run the company to printing the plastics, to mailing the statements, to running the computers that keep track of every cardholder's balance, to taking the many phone calls which cardholders place to their issuer, to protecting the customers from fraud rings. Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also a significant portion of expenses.\n\n====Rewards====\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:CreditCard-AU-Qantas-Cobrands.jpg|right|thumb|[[Qantas Frequent Flyer]] co-branded credit cards]] -->\nMany credit card customers receive rewards, such as [[frequent flyer]] points, gift certificates, or [[Cashback reward program|cash back]] as an incentive to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, which may or may not include [[balance transfer]]s, [[Payday loan|cash advances]], or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the [[breakage]] in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.\n\n===Revenues===\n\n====Interchange fee====\n{{Main|Interchange fee}}\n\nIn addition to fees paid by the card holder, merchants must also pay [[interchange fee]]s to the card-issuing bank and the card association.<ref name=\"S-1\">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000119312507242653/ds1.htm United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1], 9 November 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Tampa Tribune\">[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ Debit Cards Cash In On Rewards Riches] ''Tampa Tribune'', 15 February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228043408/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/15/bz-debit-cards-cash-in-on-rewards-riches/ |date=28 February 2008 }}</ref> For a typical credit card issuer, interchange fee revenues may represent about a quarter of total revenues.<ref name=\"FRB\"/>\n\nThese fees are typically from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary not only from merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates<ref name=\"FRB\">[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics] James Lyon, 19 January 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322001627/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/06-06/interchange.cfm |date=22 March 2008 }}</ref>), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use [[cash]], [[debit card]]s, or even [[cheque]]s.\n\n====Interest on outstanding balances====\n[[Credit card interest|Interest]] charges vary widely from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are \"teaser\" rates in effect for initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can be as high as 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the interest or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as [[South Dakota]], having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example [[Delaware]], have very weak [[usury|usury laws]]. The [[teaser rate]] no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.\n\n==Fees charged to customers==\nThe major '''credit card fees''' are for:\n*Cash advances and convenience cheques (often 3% of the amount)\n* Charges that result in exceeding the credit limit on the card (whether deliberately or by mistake), called over-limit fees\n* Exchange rate loading fees (sometimes these might not be reported on the customer's statement, even when applied).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|title=credit cards abroad|last=Gracia|first=Mike|date=9 May 2008|publisher=creditchoices.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612170006/http://www.creditchoices.co.uk/credit-card-charges-abroad.html|archivedate=12 June 2008|url-status = dead|accessdate=9 May 2008}}\n</ref> The variation of exchange rates applied by different credit cards can be very substantial, as much as 10% according to a [[Lonely Planet]] report in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|title=Comparison of exchange rates using Visa and Diners Club cards in Bali|date=3 March 2010|publisher=Lonelyplanet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711041436/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/|archivedate=11 July 2011|url-status = dead|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n* Late or overdue payments\n* Membership fees (annual or monthly), sometimes a percentage of the credit limit.\n*Returned cheque fees or payment processing fees (e.g. phone payment fee)\n* Transactions in a foreign currency (as much as 3% of the amount).

Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as \u00a325\u201335<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/credit-and-loans/article.html?in_article_id=407583&in_page_id=9 |title=This is Money Card charges to be slashed |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> until a ruling from the [[Office of Fair Trading]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |title=Current credit card default charges unfair |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327193555/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |archivedate=27 March 2010 }}</ref> that they would presume charges over \u00a312 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to \u00a312.\n\nThe higher fees originally charged were claimed to be designed to recoup the card operator's overall business costs and to try to ensure that the credit card business as a whole generated a profit, rather than simply recovering the cost to the provider of the limit breach, which has been estimated as typically between \u00a33\u2013\u00a34. Profiting from a customer's mistakes is arguably not permitted under UK common law, if the charges constitute penalties for breach of contract, or under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].\n\nSubsequent rulings in respect of personal current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the [[Office of Fair Trading]]'s ruling it seems unlikely that any further test case will take place.\n\nWhilst the law remains in the balance, many consumers have made claims against their credit card providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest that they would have earned had the money not been deducted from their account. It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of \u00a312 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's \u00a312 threshold level are more contentious.\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] requires that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into over-limit fees, presenting this as a benefit as it may avoid the possibility of a future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging over-limit fees. Whether a customer opts into the over-limit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an over-limit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how long it would take them to pay off the balance.\n\n==Neutral consumer resources==\n\n===Canada===\nThe Government of Canada maintains a database of the fees, features, interest rates and reward programs of nearly 200 credit cards available in Canada. This database is updated on a quarterly basis with information supplied by the credit card issuing companies. Information in the database is published every quarter on the website of the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).\n\nInformation in the database is published in two formats. It is available in [[PDF]] comparison tables that break down the information according to type of credit card, allowing the reader to compare the features of, for example, all the student credit cards in the database.\n\nThe database also feeds into an interactive tool on the FCAC website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |title=FCAC - Interactive Tools - Credit Card Selector Tool |work=FCAC |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221014248/http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/CCS-SCC/CCSearchCriteria.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=21 December 2013 }}</ref> The interactive tool uses several interview-type questions to build a profile of the user's credit card usage habits and needs, eliminating unsuitable choices based on the profile, so that the user is presented with a small number of credit cards and the ability to carry out detailed comparisons of features, reward programs, interest rates, etc.\n\n==Credit cards in ATMs==\n[[File:ATM 750x1300.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Acceptance mark at an [[automated teller machine]] ]]\nMany credit cards can be used in an [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] to withdraw money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer [[debit card cashback|cashback]] on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.\n\nMany credit card companies will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, at the end of a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.\n\n===Acceptance mark===\nAn ''acceptance mark'' is a logo or design that indicates which card schemes an ATM or [[merchant]] accepts. Common uses include decals and signs at merchant locations or in merchant advertisements. The purpose of the mark is to provide the card holder with information where his or her card can be used. An acceptance mark differs from the a card product name (such as [[Centurion Card|American Express Black card]], [[Eurocard (payment card)|Eurocard]]), as it shows the card scheme (group of cards) accepted. An acceptance mark however corresponds to the card scheme mark shown on a card.\n\nAn acceptance mark is however not an absolute guarantee that all cards belonging to a given card scheme will be accepted. On occasion cards issued in a foreign country may not be accepted by a merchant or ATM due to contractual or legal restrictions.\n\n==Credit cards as funding for entrepreneurs==\nCredit cards are a risky way for [[entrepreneur]]s to acquire capital for their start ups when more conventional financing is unavailable. [[Len Bosack]] and [[Sandy Lerner]] used personal credit cards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |title=A start-up's true tale |publisher=Pdp10.nocrew.org |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> to start [[Cisco Systems]]. [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]]'s start up of [[Google]] was financed by credit cards to buy the necessary computers and office equipment, more specifically \"a terabyte of [[hard disks]]\".<ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Google About Page under 1998] page retrieved 30 May 2007.{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}}</ref> Similarly, filmmaker [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] financed part of ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' using credit cards.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093200/trivia Hollywood Shuffle trivia at IMDB] page retrieved 7 July 2006</ref> Director [[Kevin Smith]] funded ''[[Clerks]]'' in part by maxing out several credit cards.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kevin Smith: how we made Clerks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/07/how-we-made-clerks-kevin-smith |access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Actor [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] also financed his production of ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming]]'' partly through his credit cards. Famed hedge fund manager [[Bruce Kovner]] began his career (and, later on, his firm [[Caxton Associates]]) in financial markets by borrowing from his credit card. UK entrepreneur [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]] (as seen on ''[[Dragons' Den]]'') financed his first business using several credit cards.\n\n==Problems==\nTravelers from the U.S. had encountered problems abroad because many countries have introduced [[smart card]]s, but the U.S. had not. {{As of|2010}}, the U.S. banking system had not updated the cards and associated readers in the U.S., stating that the costs were prohibitive.

Born in [[Cardiff]], he began his career with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], joining the side as an apprentice in 1969. He made his professional debut for the club in 1972, winning his first honours the same season by helping the side win the [[Welsh Cup]]. He suffered relegation with Cardiff in 1975 but helped the side win promotion back to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at the first attempt, scoring 10 goals during the season. \n\nHe made over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club, becoming the club's all-time Football League appearance record holder, during a 13-year spell. He also gained ten caps for Wales.\n\n==Early life==\nDwyer was born on 28 October 1953 in the house where his family resided on Penarth Road in [[Grangetown, Cardiff]]. The area was in the midst of an economic downturn following the end of the Second World War and the demand for coal, one of the main industries of the region, which also affected the local docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=17}}</ref> Dwyer described his family home as having \"tiny living quarters\" and had no bathroom, meaning the family bathed in front of the fire in a metal bath with water boiled on the stove. The house also had no central heating leading to \"very harsh\" nights in winter.<ref name=\"dl1819\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> His parents had met and married in [[Tonypandy]] where his father had worked as a miner. In the hope of improving their prospects, the pair moved to Cardiff where his father found work at a [[foundry]] in [[Tremorfa]]. His mother, Constance, also took up work in the canteen of an aluminium manufacturing factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDwyer was the fifth child born to his parents. He had three older brothers, Brian, Kenny and Peter, and an older sister, Maureen. His siblings were significantly older than Dwyer and his brothers had already moved out of the family home by the time he was born.<ref name=\"dl1819\"/> Of his three brothers, Kenny died at the age of 36 from diabetes,<ref name=\"dl1819\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=nLdRsWYvKEND5wzucfk16A&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=29 February 2020|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> Peter joined the armed forces. His other, Brian, was a keen sportsman and played football at amateur level for local side St Patrick's. He also represented Wales at boxing at the [[Commonwealth Games|Empire Games]].<ref name=\"dl1819\"/>\n\nAs a child, Dwyer attended St. Patrick's Primary School where he joined the school band as a drummer.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=21}}</ref> As his family was relatively poor, he and his friends would often steal fruit and vegetables from gardens and, on one occasion, he was caught shoplifting by a policeman.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=24}}</ref> He took up numerous sporting activities in his youth, including cricket, rugby and baseball, but was most keen on football, idolising [[Billy Bremner]] and [[George Best]]. Dwyer supports [[Cardiff City F.C.]] and began attending matches at the club's home ground, [[Ninian Park]], from a young age. Often unable to afford the entry fee for matches, he and his friends would often sneak into the ground by climbing disused [[Railway tie|railway sleepers]] to scale the fencing around the stands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nDwyer attended Bishop Mostyn High School as a teenager but later admitted to having little interest in pursuing his academic studies, choosing to focus on his sporting activities. He played rugby during midweek and football on Saturdays, sometimes playing two matches in one day, in the morning for his school's team and in the afternoon for North Clive Street Youth Club. In summer months, he also played baseball for Cardiff Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=33}}</ref> Dwyer met his future wife Ann in his teens at a local nightclub and the pair began dating soon after.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Football career==\n===Youth and first team breakthrough===\nDwyer's childhood dream was to become a professional footballer and his career began to progress at the age of 14 when he was picked to represent the Cardiff Schools side for the first time. He gained international recognition soon after when he was slecetes to represent Wales at under-15 level in the [[Victory Shield]], a youth competition held between the [[Home Nations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=35\u201337}}</ref> Depsite this, he initially struggled to attract interest from clubs until he was invited to train with the youth team at Cardiff City by Harry Parsons, a long serving employee of the club. Dwyer began training with the side every Tuesday but still held little hope of fulfilling his dream. He was due to start a carpentry apprenticeship with a company at [[Cardiff Docks]] which had been arranged by his brother-in-law who worked at the site. To Dwyer's surprise, he was offered a contract by Cardiff when he turned 16 in 1969, earning around \u00a35 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nDwyer became affectionally known as \"Joe\" by Cardiff fans and teammates,<ref name=defenderoao>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2006/12/16/dwyer-the-defender-on-and-off-the-pitch-91466-18274034/ |title=Dwyer the defender on and off the pitch |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> a nickname that originated during his early years at the club when goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]] commented that Dwyer resembled [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] forward [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=41}}</ref> As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=47}}</ref> With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the [[FA Youth Cup]] and reached the  [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1970s|final]] of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final.

Cardiff's results gradually stabilised under O'Farrell with Dwyer scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 9 March 1974 after heading in a cross from [[Leighton Phillips]].<ref name=\"s73\"/><ref name=\"dl7072\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nO'Farrell resigned suddenly in April 1974 and the side again avoided relegation on the final day of the season, drawing 1\u20131 with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to relegate their opponents in their stead. Dwyer won his second Welsh Cup at the end of the season, as Cardiff defeated [[Stourbridge F.C.|Stourbridge]] under O'Farrell's assistant [[Jimmy Andrews]].<ref name=\"dl7072\"/> In only his second season as a senior professional, Dwyer was ever present in the league for Cardiff, playing in all 42 matches during the campaign, and missed one first team match, the first leg of the Welsh Cup final against Stourbridge, playing 52 times.<ref name=\"s73\"/> Andrews was forced to sell players to balance finances ahead of the 1974\u201376 season and the sales placed further strain on the club's results as the side were placed in the relegation zone midway through the campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> In January 1975, Cardiff played [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[The Den]].

Dwyer's actions had caused fans from both sides to clash and a Millwall supporter ran onto the pitch and aimed a punch at Dwyer. Seeing the punch coming, Dwyer was able to avoid being hit and grabbed the fan in a headlock until he was apprehended by police. Dwyer later refused to press charges against the fan. Cardiff finished the season in 21st position, suffering relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and went on to lose the Welsh Cup final 5\u20132 to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] over two legs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion and Second Division return===\n\nRelegation prompted Andrews to rebuild his squad, letting several players leave and replacing them with new signings. Dwyer credited one of the new arrivals, Wales international [[Mike England]], as being a positive influence on his game remarking how he \"made me a better player\".<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=82\u201383}}</ref> Although the team's results were generally positive, Andrews believed his team lacked physical presence in midfield and moved Dwyer into an unfamiliar holding midfield role. As well as his defensive responsibilities, Dwyer also provided an attacking impetus by regularly charging into the penalty area for crosses. This proved fruitful immediately as he scored a brace in his first match in the new role and was denied a first career [[hat-trick]] when he missed a penalty late in the game.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=84}}</ref> \n\nOn 8 November 1975, while playing in a league match against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Dwyer collided with an opposition player and received a blow from the player's knee to the back of his head and was knocked unconscious. The impact resulted in Dwyer slowing his tongue and he briefly stopped breathing. Cardiff physio Ron Durham managed to clear his airway by using the corner flag pole revive him with [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance that had driven onto the [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] pitch. Some initial reports even suggested that Dwyer had passed away, however, he was back playing for the Bluebirds just seven days later against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=85\u201386}}</ref> He continued his goalscoring form in his new role, scoring another brace during a 5\u20132 victory over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in December and against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and Colchester in February 1976.<ref name=\"s75\"/> The side went on to secure promotion back to the Second Division at the first attempt, winning six of their last nine matches of the season and conceding a single goal in the process.<ref name=\"s75\"/> Dwyer also won the Welsh Cup for the third time in his career, defeating [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] over two legs in the final. In the first leg, Dwyer scored twice to finish the campaign with 10 goals in all competitions, a career high tally. He also recorded a career high 58 appearances, missing only one of the club's first team matches in all competitions.<ref name=\"s75\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n\nDwyer missed the start of the [[1976\u20131977 in English football|1976\u201377 season]] after breaking his ankle in a baseball match days before the club's first match of the campaign against Swiss side [[Servette FC|Servette]] in the Cup Winners' Cup. He had continued to play baseball alongside his football career, concealing the fact from the staff at Cardiff, and hid the cause of the injury by claiming he had fallen down the stairs at his home.<ref name=\"dl90\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref> He returned to the side in late September, in a goalless draw with Millwall.<ref name=\"s76\"/> The team travelled to Georgia ahead for Dwyer's next appearance where they suffered a 3\u20130 defeat to [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] in a match that was attended by 100,000 spectators.<ref name=\"s76\"/><ref name=\"dl93\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=93}}</ref> Upon his return, Dwyer found himself playing in his more usual role in defence rather than in midfield.<ref name=\"dl93\"/> Cardiff again struggled in the Second Division but avoided relegation on the final day of the season, after drawing 1\u20131 with [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=98}}</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378 season]], Cardiff was struggling financially and the club was dealt a further blow by the restriction of crowd numbers at Ninian Park due to safety concerns. Dwyer was contacted by a former professional footballer who had recommended him to Greek side [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]. Dwyer was offered wages considerably higher than those he received with Cardiff, a villa and places at an English school for his children but the move broke down when Andrews refused to contemplate selling. [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] also made offers for Dwyer, with Bristol's bid totalling around \u00a3150,000, but Andrews again rejected the advances. The club began the season in poor form, winning one of its opening 10 matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=102\u2013104}}</ref> Dwyer bemoaned that the squad suffered a \"severe lack of confidence\" and the side suffered several heavy defeats, including conceding six goals in consecutive matches against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in December 1977.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n \nHis final appearance for the club came on 17 March 1985 in a 4\u20131 defeat against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Following the match, Dwyer lambasted several of his teammates after believing that they had given up during the game. His outburst led manager [[Alan Durban]] to drop Dwyer from the side and inform him that he was no longer needed at the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061300/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 January 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Durban Packed Me off to Rochdale after My City Rant - Dwyer |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> Rival South Wales clubs [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] showed interest in signing him, although Durban did not inform Dwyer of their interest.

October 1953) is a Welsh former professional [[Association football|footballer]]. Born in [[Cardiff]], he began his career with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], joining the side as an apprentice in 1969. He made his professional debut for the club in 1972, winning his first honours the same season by helping the side win the [[Welsh Cup]]. He suffered relegation with Cardiff in 1975 but helped the side win promotion back to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at the first attempt, scoring 10 goals during the season. \n\nHe made over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club, becoming the club's all-time Football League appearance record holder, during a 13-year spell. He also gained ten caps for Wales.\n\n==Early life==\nDwyer was born on 28 October 1953 in the house where his family resided on Penarth Road in [[Grangetown, Cardiff]]. The area was in the midst of an economic downturn following the end of the Second World War and the demand for coal, one of the main industries of the region, which also affected the local docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=17}}</ref> Dwyer described his family home as having \"tiny living quarters\" and had no bathroom, meaning the family bathed in front of the fire in a metal bath with water boiled on the stove. The house also had no central heating leading to \"very harsh\" nights in winter.<ref name=\"dl1819\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> His parents had met and married in [[Tonypandy]] where his father had worked as a miner. In the hope of improving their prospects, the pair moved to Cardiff where his father found work at a [[foundry]] in [[Tremorfa]]. His mother, Constance, also took up work in the canteen of an aluminium manufacturing factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDwyer was the fifth child born to his parents. He had three older brothers, Brian, Kenny and Peter, and an older sister, Maureen. His siblings were significantly older than Dwyer and his brothers had already moved out of the family home by the time he was born.<ref name=\"dl1819\"/> Of his three brothers, Kenny died at the age of 36 from diabetes,<ref name=\"dl1819\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=nLdRsWYvKEND5wzucfk16A&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=29 February 2020|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> Peter joined the armed forces. His other, Brian, was a keen sportsman and played football at amateur level for local side St Patrick's. He also represented Wales at boxing at the [[Commonwealth Games|Empire Games]].<ref name=\"dl1819\"/>\n\nAs a child, Dwyer attended St. Patrick's Primary School where he joined the school band as a drummer.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=21}}</ref> As his family was relatively poor, he and his friends would often steal fruit and vegetables from gardens and, on one occasion, he was caught shoplifting by a policeman.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=24}}</ref> He took up numerous sporting activities in his youth, including cricket, rugby and baseball, but was most keen on football, idolising [[Billy Bremner]] and [[George Best]]. Dwyer supports [[Cardiff City F.C.]] and began attending matches at the club's home ground, [[Ninian Park]], from a young age. Often unable to afford the entry fee for matches, he and his friends would often sneak into the ground by climbing disused [[Railway tie|railway sleepers]] to scale the fencing around the stands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nDwyer attended Bishop Mostyn High School as a teenager but later admitted to having little interest in pursuing his academic studies, choosing to focus on his sporting activities. He played rugby during midweek and football on Saturdays, sometimes playing two matches in one day, in the morning for his school's team and in the afternoon for North Clive Street Youth Club. In summer months, he also played baseball for Cardiff Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=33}}</ref> Dwyer met his future wife Ann in his teens at a local nightclub and the pair began dating soon after.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Football career==\n===Youth and first team breakthrough===\nDwyer's childhood dream was to become a professional footballer and his career began to progress at the age of 14 when he was picked to represent the Cardiff Schools side for the first time. He gained international recognition soon after when he was slecetes to represent Wales at under-15 level in the [[Victory Shield]], a youth competition held between the [[Home Nations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=35\u201337}}</ref> Depsite this, he initially struggled to attract interest from clubs until he was invited to train with the youth team at Cardiff City by Harry Parsons, a long serving employee of the club. Dwyer began training with the side every Tuesday but still held little hope of fulfilling his dream. He was due to start a carpentry apprenticeship with a company at [[Cardiff Docks]] which had been arranged by his brother-in-law who worked at the site. To Dwyer's surprise, he was offered a contract by Cardiff when he turned 16 in 1969, earning around \u00a35 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nDwyer became affectionally known as \"Joe\" by Cardiff fans and teammates,<ref name=defenderoao>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2006/12/16/dwyer-the-defender-on-and-off-the-pitch-91466-18274034/ |title=Dwyer the defender on and off the pitch |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> a nickname that originated during his early years at the club when goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]] commented that Dwyer resembled [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] forward [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=41}}</ref> As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=47}}</ref> With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the [[FA Youth Cup]] and reached the  [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1970s|final]] of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final.

On 7 October 1972, Scoular dropped [[David Carver]] from the side and handed Dwyer his professional debut against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/10/30/phil-dwyer-banned-from-driving-91466-22149335/ |title=Phil Dwyer banned from driving |publisher=[[South Wales Echo]] |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> Playing as a [[Rightback|right-back]], he helped the side record a goalless draw, having been reduced to ten men when [[Alan Foggon]] had been sent off after 30 minutes.<ref name=\"dl6062\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=60\u201362}}</ref> Dwyer remained in the first team for the remainder of the season and was ever present for the side in all competitions following his debut.

Despite the team's disappointing league form, Dwyer ended the season by winning his first senior trophy as Cardiff defeated [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]] 5\u20130 in the final of the [[Welsh Cup]].<ref name=\"dl6062\"/>\n\n===First team regular===\n\nThe previous season's low finish prompted Scoular to release several of Dwyer's youth teammates who had been promoted to the senior squad. Dwyer, however, was retained and promoted to the first team on a permanent basis.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=66}}</ref> Victory in the Welsh Cup had qualified Cardiff for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and Dwyer made his debut in continental competition on 17 September 1974 in a goalless draw with Portuguese side [[Sporting CP]]. Cardiff were elimined after losing the return leg 2\u20131.<ref name=\"s73\"/> Scoular was sacked in November as the club struggled in the Second Division and was eventually replaced by [[Frank O'Farrell]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=67\u201368}}</ref> Dwyer's performances resulted in his selection for the Wales under-23 side ahead of a match against [[England national under-21 football team|England]] at [[Ashton Gate Stadium]] in January 1974, helping his side to a 0\u20130 draw. Cardiff's results gradually stabilised under O'Farrell with Dwyer scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 9 March 1974 after heading in a cross from [[Leighton Phillips]].<ref name=\"s73\"/><ref name=\"dl7072\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nO'Farrell resigned suddenly in April 1974 and the side again avoided relegation on the final day of the season, drawing 1\u20131 with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to relegate their opponents in their stead. Dwyer won his second Welsh Cup at the end of the season, as Cardiff defeated [[Stourbridge F.C.|Stourbridge]] under O'Farrell's assistant [[Jimmy Andrews]].<ref name=\"dl7072\"/> In only his second season as a senior professional, Dwyer was ever present in the league for Cardiff, playing in all 42 matches during the campaign, and missed one first team match, the first leg of the Welsh Cup final against Stourbridge, playing 52 times.<ref name=\"s73\"/> Andrews was forced to sell players to balance finances ahead of the 1974\u201376 season and the sales placed further strain on the club's results as the side were placed in the relegation zone midway through the campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> In January 1975, Cardiff played [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[The Den]]. With Cardiff trailing 5\u20131, a frustrated Dwyer deliberately collided with Millwall goalkeeper [[Ray Goddard]] causing the opposition player to be stretchered off the field with a concussion. Dwyer's actions had caused fans from both sides to clash and a Millwall supporter ran onto the pitch and aimed a punch at Dwyer. Seeing the punch coming, Dwyer was able to avoid being hit and grabbed the fan in a headlock until he was apprehended by police. Dwyer later refused to press charges against the fan. Cardiff finished the season in 21st position, suffering relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and went on to lose the Welsh Cup final 5\u20132 to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] over two legs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion and Second Division return===\n\nRelegation prompted Andrews to rebuild his squad, letting several players leave and replacing them with new signings. Dwyer credited one of the new arrivals, Wales international [[Mike England]], as being a positive influence on his game remarking how he \"made me a better player\".<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=82\u201383}}</ref> Although the team's results were generally positive, Andrews believed his team lacked physical presence in midfield and moved Dwyer into an unfamiliar holding midfield role. As well as his defensive responsibilities, Dwyer also provided an attacking impetus by regularly charging into the penalty area for crosses. This proved fruitful immediately as he scored a brace in his first match in the new role and was denied a first career [[hat-trick]] when he missed a penalty late in the game.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=84}}</ref> \n\nOn 8 November 1975, while playing in a league match against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Dwyer collided with an opposition player and received a blow from the player's knee to the back of his head and was knocked unconscious. The impact resulted in Dwyer slowing his tongue and he briefly stopped breathing. Cardiff physio Ron Durham managed to clear his airway by using the corner flag pole revive him with [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance that had driven onto the [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] pitch. Some initial reports even suggested that Dwyer had passed away, however, he was back playing for the Bluebirds just seven days later against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=85\u201386}}</ref> He continued his goalscoring form in his new role, scoring another brace during a 5\u20132 victory over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in December and against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and Colchester in February 1976.<ref name=\"s75\"/> The side went on to secure promotion back to the Second Division at the first attempt, winning six of their last nine matches of the season and conceding a single goal in the process.<ref name=\"s75\"/> Dwyer also won the Welsh Cup for the third time in his career, defeating [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] over two legs in the final. In the first leg, Dwyer scored twice to finish the campaign with 10 goals in all competitions, a career high tally. He also recorded a career high 58 appearances, missing only one of the club's first team matches in all competitions.<ref name=\"s75\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n\nDwyer missed the start of the [[1976\u20131977 in English football|1976\u201377 season]] after breaking his ankle in a baseball match days before the club's first match of the campaign against Swiss side [[Servette FC|Servette]] in the Cup Winners' Cup.

Dwyer was contacted by a former professional footballer who had recommended him to Greek side [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]. Dwyer was offered wages considerably higher than those he received with Cardiff, a villa and places at an English school for his children but the move broke down when Andrews refused to contemplate selling. [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] also made offers for Dwyer, with Bristol's bid totalling around \u00a3150,000, but Andrews again rejected the advances. The club began the season in poor form, winning one of its opening 10 matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=102\u2013104}}</ref> Dwyer bemoaned that the squad suffered a \"severe lack of confidence\" and the side suffered several heavy defeats, including conceding six goals in consecutive matches against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [tBolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in December 1977.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n \nHis final appearance for the club came on 17 March 1985 in a 4\u20131 defeat against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].

The first store named \"Shoppers Drug Mart\" was at [[Shoppers World Danforth]] from which it derived the name.\n\nKoffler revamped the concept of the 20th century \u201cdrug store\u201d in Canada by removing the [[soda fountain]] and emphasizing the dispensary, requiring his pharmacists to wear starched white coats as a symbol of their professionalism. In the mid-1950s, he began acquiring other drug stores and organized them around a then-novel franchising concept: pharmacist \u201cassociates\u201d would own and operate their own stores within the system and share in the profits. In 1968, Shoppers Drug Mart grew to 52 stores in Ontario by merging with 33 Plaza Drugstores. In 1971, Shoppers Drug Mart purchased 87 [[Cunningham Drug (Canada)|Cunningham Drug]] Stores in British Columbia and Alberta. In 1974, Lord's Supervalue Pharmacies 26 stores in Atlantic Canada joined the Shoppers Drug Mart family. In 1986 Shoppers Drug Mart bought Super X Drugstores, an Ontario-area chain of 72 stores. In 1992, the company bought up the Western Canadian chain Pinder's Drugs, and followed this in 1995 with a chain of 24 Bi-Rite Drug Stores based in western Canada. Also in 1995, Shoppers Drug Mart acquired 135 Big V Drugstores. In 1996, the first Shoppers Home Health Care store opened.\n\nWhen Koffler retired in 1986, he sold the chain to [[Imasco|Imasco Limited]]. That same year, David Bloom, a former Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacist, was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Bloom would lead the organization until retiring in 2001, having devoted a total of 35 years of service to the Company. During David Bloom's tenure, Shoppers doubled its number of stores, quadrupled its sales and increased profit ten-fold. David Bloom also launched the Shoppers Optimum loyalty program in 2000 which quickly became the largest and most successful loyalty program in Canada. The Optimum program currently boasts over 10 million members in Canada.\n\nIn 2000, after Imasco Limited had been taken over by BAT Industries (formerly [[British American Tobacco]]), Shoppers was sold to a consortium of institutional investors including [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] & Co. (KKR), [[Bain Capital]], Inc., [[DLJ Merchant Banking Partners]], [[Charlesbank Capital Partners]], [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]], [[CIBC Capital Partners]], and Shoppers Drug Mart's senior management and pharmacist/owners.\n\nIn 2001, Glenn Murphy was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In November of that same year, Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation was publicly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2002, Shoppers Drug Mart introduced its first large format stores, with more space, a sleek and modern look, and a stronger focus on cosmetic products. Typically the cosmetics section faces the entrance, with the pharmacy counter at the back and a convenience food section, called Food Essentials, near the front cash. In most suburban areas, this new format takes the form of new or relocated store, typically stand-alone \"[[big-box]]\" locations as opposed to smaller mall or strip-mall locations.\n\nIn 2003, Shoppers Drug Mart introduced its first beautyBOUTIQUE, setting a new standard for the industry with its open-sell display and unbiased approach to customer service in prestige cosmetic retailing.

The company does not intend to actually produce the product but had signed supply arrangements with companies such as [[Aurora Cannabis]], [[Aphria (company)|Aphria, Inc.]], MedReleaf Corp.

In the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1843\u20131868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the ''Disposiciones de Zaragoza'' (1845) and  the ''Reglamento para la represi\u00f3n de los excesos de la prostituci\u00f3n en Madrid'' (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. \n(Guerena 2003, 2008)\n  \nIn 1935 during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] (1931\u201336) prostitution was prohibited. Once the [[Francoist Spain|Dictatorship]] (1939\u201375) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially ''abolitionist'' on 18 June 1962, when the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (''C\u00f3digo Penal'') according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention,  regarded sex workers (''trabajadores sexuales'') as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.<ref>Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001).

In practice however, prostitution was quietly ignored and tolerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-the-world-capital-of-prostitution-2151581.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Alasdair | last=Fotheringham | title=Spain, the world capital of prostitution? | date=5 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[History of Spain (1975\u2013present)|democracy was restored in 1975]], it was not till the Penal Code revisions of 1995<ref>Peter Pierson.

In the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1843\u20131868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the ''Disposiciones de Zaragoza'' (1845) and  the ''Reglamento para la represi\u00f3n de los excesos de la prostituci\u00f3n en Madrid'' (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. \n(Guerena 2003, 2008)\n  \nIn 1935 during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] (1931\u201336) prostitution was prohibited. Once the [[Francoist Spain|Dictatorship]] (1939\u201375) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially ''abolitionist'' on 18 June 1962, when the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (''C\u00f3digo Penal'') according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention,  regarded sex workers (''trabajadores sexuales'') as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.<ref>Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001).
