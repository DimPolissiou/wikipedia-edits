The town was an important centre for the oil shale economy in the 19th and 20th Centuries. West Calder has its own [[West Calder railway station|railway station]]. The surrounding villages that take the town's name in their address - [[Polbeth]], [[Addiewell]], Loganlea, Harburn and Westwood - outline the area that this town encompasses, and they all have played an important part in the history of the town as well as West Lothian. It is also the most northerly centre of the [[Dogs Trust]], closely followed by the new centre at [[Glasgow]]. The town is a 10-minute drive from Livingston, which is host to two large shopping centres.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of West Calder history}}\n\n=== Burngrange Pit ===\nBurngrange, an area west of the village, was the site of the [[Burngrange mining disaster]] in 1947.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:West Calder Main Street.jpg|thumb|West Calder Main Street looking towards the East End]]\n\nMost housing in the village dates from the mid-20th century, though it has a public library built as early as 1903.

The [[parish]] church (1643) was abandoned in 1880 and is now roofless.\n\n===Culture===\nThe Five Sisters shale bings to the north of West Calder were named by artist John Latham during his time with an [[Artist Placement Group]] project with the Scottish Office\u2019s Development Agency in 1975\u20136.<ref>http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/17/waste-to-monument-john-lathams-niddrie-woman</ref>\n\nA description of West Calder written by Rev.
