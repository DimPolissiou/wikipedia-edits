{"title_page": "History of the University of South Carolina", "text_new": "This '''History of the University of South Carolina''' began in the 18th century when intersectional differences arose between the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] and [[the Upstate]].  It was conceived that a state supported college located in the center of the state at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], [[South Carolina]] would foster friendships between those of both regions thus allowing the state to present a united front to the nation when threatened with issues jeopardizing the South Carolina way of life.  The [[University of South Carolina|University of South Carolina's]] history can be described in four distinct phases:  a firebrand college (1801\u20131862), constant reorganization (1865\u20131891), college to university (1891\u20131944) and the state's university (1944\u2013present).\n[[Image:USCHorseshoe1872.jpg|right|500px|thumb|An 1872 illustration of the Horseshoe, USC's original campus. The Maxcy Monument is in the center]]\n\n==Firebrand college, 1801\u20131862==\n\n===South Carolina College===\n[[File:JonathanMaxcy.jpg|thumb|left|Jonathan Maxcy]]\n[[Image:USCenrollment1805-1862.GIF|right|500px|South Carolina College Enrollment]]\nThe University was founded as '''South Carolina College''' on December 19, 1801 by an act of the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] after [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[John Drayton]] pushed for its foundation on November 23, 1801.  The establishment of a publicly funded college at the capital was intended to unite and promote harmony between the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] and the [[The Upstate|Backcountry]].  On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. [[Jonathan Maxcy]] was its first president and served until his death in 1820.\n\nWith the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the [[Southern United States|South]] and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including [[Francis Lieber]], [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], and [[Joseph LeConte]].  However, the college suffered greatly and lost most of its prestige when it closed during the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{see also|South Carolina College Cadets}}\nThe students formed a cadet [[Company (military unit)|company]] in December 1860 to aid the Southern cause, but an order by [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Francis Wilkinson Pickens|Pickens]] prevented them from leaving Columbia.  Undeterred, the students disbanded their company on April 12 and formed a new company while en route to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] so that the governor's previous holding orders would be invalid.  Once in Charleston, General [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Beauregard]] assigned the company to guard [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]], much to the dismay of the students who greatly desired to be a part of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]].  After three weeks of guard duty, the student cadet company returned to Columbia to a hero's welcome.\n\nLater in June 1861, the students reformed the company and requested to be accepted for service.  Governor Pickens accepted their request provided that the faculty also approved the venture, but the faculty did not give its consent because they did not want the college to needlessly be closed.  The frustrated students even went as far as negotiating service of their unit with [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], who agreed, but again Governor Pickens denied their use because the faculty was not willing to let them go.\n\nWhen the students returned in October, they reorganized their military unit as the \"third company.\"  The [[Union Army|Union]] attack of the South Carolina coast in November at the [[Battle of Port Royal]] led Governor Pickens to agree to their request to be mustered for active duty, but [[Presidents of the University of South Carolina|President]] [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet|Longstreet]] and the faculty steadfastly maintained their opposition to the students leaving for service.  However, with the support of the governor the students ignored the protests of the faculty and departed for the Lowcountry.  Governor Pickens kept the student company in Charleston to serve as his bodyguard and because the Union forces at Port Royal did not press their advantage, he released the students from military service on December 10.\n\nSeventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned as best it could until a call by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers.  A system of conscription would begin on March 20 for all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, so on March 8 all of the students at the college volunteered for service in order to avoid the dishonor of having been conscripted.  Despite the depletion of students, the professors issued a notice that the college would temporarily close and would reopen to those under eighteen.  When the college reopened on March 17, only nine students showed up for classes and it became quite apparent to all that the college would not last past the end of the term in June.\n\nOn June 25 with the consent of the state government, the Confederate authorities took possession of the college buildings and converted them into a hospital.  After many unsuccessful attempts to reopen the college, the trustees passed a resolution on December 2, 1863 that officially closed the college.  By February 1865, [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] army had reached the outskirts of Columbia and the college was spared from destruction by the Union forces because of its use as a hospital.  In addition, a company of the [[25th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was stationed at the campus on February 17 to protect it from harm and to thwart off pillaging Yankee soldiers.\n\n==Reorganization, 1865\u20131891==\n\n===Radical University===\nThe Union army took possession of the college on May 24, 1865 and although the future for the college under military control, General [[John Porter Hatch]] sent a letter on June 19 to the remaining professors at the college that it should reopen as soon as possible.  The appointment of [[Benjamin Franklin Perry]] as provisional [[governor of South Carolina]] on June 30 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] restored civilian rule to the state.  Perry reinstated the trustees to their positions and the board met on September 20 to authorize the college to reopen on the first Monday of January in 1866.\n\nIn a message to the legislature in October, Perry sought to convert the college into a university because with the state in an impoverished situation, it would provide a more practical education.  The model that he wished to follow was the elective system used by the [[University of Virginia]].  Perry was succeeded in November as governor by [[James Lawrence Orr]], a graduate of the University of Virginia, who also wished to see the college adopt the curriculum of his alma mater.  Little opposition developed to change the College into a university and bill to establish the '''University of South Carolina''' was passed by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on December 19, 1865, sixty-four years after the institution's foundation.\n\nThe schools of the university remained largely the same as they were in the College, with the addition of a school of engineering and mathematics.  For the students, the difference was great because they were given much more freedom than afforded in the College, and they were given the ability to choose their classes rather than having to submit to a compulsory curriculum identical for all.  Perry and Orr believed that the relaxed atmosphere at the University would allow it to prosper and reach three or four hundred students in a few years.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 32}}</ref>\n\nThe reopening of the University was pushed back to January 10 due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings on the campus and to celebrate the anniversary of the original opening of South Carolina College.  Fewer than fifty students attended in the first term, which alarmed Governor Orr.  He recommended to the General Assembly that schools of law and medicine be added, which the legislature established in 1866.  Despite this step, the University faced an ominous future as the state was beginning to undergo [[Radical Reconstruction|Reconstruction]].\n\nAfter [[Radical Republicans]] gained control of the state government in 1868, they sought to integrate the University; the constitution of 1868 had stated that all universities of the state should be \"free and open to all the children and youths of the State, without regard to race and color.\"<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 45}}</ref>  Former Governor Orr urged the legislature to preserve the University as an institution for the whites and to convert the dormant campus of [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] into a college for the blacks.  Governor [[Robert Kingston Scott]] ignored this request and recommended that the legislature bring the University into compliance with the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] to make it qualify as a land grant college and accept federal aid; it had to remove race as an admissions criteria.\n\nThe University Act of 1869 reorganized the University and provided it with generous state financial support.  An amendment was added to the act by [[W. J. Whipper]], a black representative from [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], to prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the University.  The legislature elected two black trustees to the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|governing board of the University]] on March 9, 1869.  [[Franklin J. Moses, Jr.]], state representative and speaker of the house, also supported admission of all races to the state school. In October 1873, [[Henry E. Hayne]], the Republican secretary of state, was admitted as the first black student; he was of mostly white ancestry with a white politician father.\n\nThe admission of black students to the University was inevitable, and three factors contributed to this. First, the University never achieved a level of enrollment that was commensurate with its financial backing by the legislature.  Enrollment never exceeded one hundred students, whereas the enrollment at [[Wofford College]] exceeded that mark in 1870.  White students were believed to avoid the university from fear it would be integrated.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The second reason was the failure of the state to provide an adequate public university for the education of blacks. It was trying to compensate rapidly for the state's failure to educate blacks in the antebellum years. In 1872, funds were allocated for the [[South Carolina State University|Agricultural and Mechanical Institute]] at [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]], but they were badly mismanaged. Black legislators called for the opening of the University to black students. Finally, the [[South Carolina Republican Party|state Republican party]] split for the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1872|election of 1872]] between Radical and moderate factions.  The Radicals won and pressed their advantage by electing four blacks to the Board of Trustees, thus constituting a majority.\n\nThe legislature established a normal school to train teachers for the lower grades on the campus of the University as well as a preparatory school, since most black students of the state had been deprived of strong academic training in years past. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished.  On October 7, 1873, [[Henry E. Hayne]], the [[Secretary of State of South Carolina]], became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the University.<ref>{{cite book | first = John S. | last = Reynolds | title = Reconstruction in South Carolina | url = https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog | year = 1969 | publisher = Negro University Press | pages = [https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog/page/n243 233]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 66}}</ref>  As a result of his enrollment, three professors resigned, and some white students left.\n\nOn October 8, enrollment stood at eight students, seven of whom were the sons of professors.  The number increased to twenty-two students after many politicians registered with the University to show that it was open for both races, yet few of the politicians attended classes.  Troubled by the low enrollment, [[State Treasurer of South Carolina]], [[Francis L. Cardozo]] went to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and persuaded a handful of students at [[Howard University]] to transfer to the University.  Drastic measures were required to increase the number of students and the legislature passed an act in February 1874 to provide for 124 scholarships of $200.  The conservative press denounced this move because with the absence of tuition, it meant that students were effectively being paid to attend the University, but poor students were often critical to family support, and scholarships helped them cover living expenses.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 71}}</ref>  Many of the scholarship students could not meet the entrance requirements into the freshman class, so the faculty assembled them into a sub-freshman class. This plan was abolished in 1875 as the legislature had not authorized it.\n\nThe scholarships achieved their desired effect in increasing enrollment and by 1875, 90% of the student body was black.<ref>{{cite book | first = John S. | last = Reynolds | title = Reconstruction in South Carolina | url = https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog | year = 1969 | publisher = Negro University Press | pages = [https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog/page/n246 236]}}</ref>  The University of South Carolina holds the distinction of being the only state university in the South to admit and grant degrees to black students during Reconstruction.  When the Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876, they quickly acted to end admission of blacks, closing the University on June 7, 1877 by a joint resolution of the General Assembly. They passed legislation authorizing only white students and setting up Claflin College as the state institution for black students.\n\n===Redeemer University===\nIt was far from certain that the University would be reopened and debate ensued in the General Assembly over the necessity of the University.  Many legislators, led by [[Martin Witherspoon Gary]], felt that the state had other obligations and it was not practical for the state to spend money on the University.  In addition, these legislators were from [[the Upstate]] and had no attachment to the University. They were not part of the planter elite and had attended other schools.  An act to reorganize the University was passed by the [[South Carolina Senate|state Senate]] by two votes on March 2, 1878, but it did not provide for the appropriation of funds to the reopening.  The act specified that the University was to consist of two branches, one styled as the South Carolina College in Columbia for the whites and [[Claflin University|Claflin College]] in Orangeburg for the blacks.  In order to mollify agitation by the farming interests, a section of the act specified that an agricultural department was to be established with the University.\n\nOn October 5, 1880 the institution was reopened as the '''South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts''' and largely derived its funding from the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]].  Despite its name as an agriculture and mechanical college, few students showed an interest in either area.  Only nine students worked the {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} college farm for the first session and just twenty-one attended the mechanical shop.  Because the state could not afford a liberal arts University, it took advantage of the Morrill Act in order to acquire federal funds, and offered some agriculture program to satisfy its requirements.\n\nBy 1881, the state's financial situation was markedly improved and Governor [[Johnson Hagood (governor)|Johnson Hagood]] called for greater expenditures on higher education.  With a much higher appropriation, the trustees abolished the farming and mechanical foreman positions, in 1882 restoring the institution to its [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] status as the South Carolina College.  An agriculture department remained, but little of the curriculum was agricultural, and it was essentially identical to the general science program. The department suffered from neglect because its professor, [[John McLaren McBryde]], was also the President of the institution and in that position he focused most of his energies.\n\nIn the latter years of the 1880s, the College increasingly came under attack from religious groups and agricultural interests.  The denominational colleges, struggling to rebuild from the Civil War, demanded that free tuition be ended at the college, and the General Assembly capitulated in 1887 by fixing tuition rates at $40 per year.  Led by [[Benjamin Tillman|Ben Tillman]] [who owned 400 acres as a planter, cultivated by tenant farmers], the agrarians pushed to establish a separate agriculture college because they believed that the College was not providing an adequate education in agriculture.  Despite Tillman's rhetoric, a majority of the students were sons of farmers. At that time, the most advanced agricultural research was being conducted at [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and the [[University of California]], both liberal arts colleges.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 138\u2013139}}</ref>\n\nTo take advantage of the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] and to assuage the concerns of the farmers, the legislature passed an act in 1887 to reorganize the college as the University of South Carolina with six schools and colleges.  An [[agricultural experiment station]] was set up, the college farm was expanded by {{convert|100|acre|km2}}, and a well-developed agriculture program was initiated.  The University was so successful that Ben Tillman announced his retirement from public life.\n\n[[Thomas Green Clemson]] bequeathed his estate in 1888 to establish and endow a separate agriculture college in the state. Tillman reemerged to carry the cause to the legislature and in 1889, Governor [[John Peter Richardson III|Richardson]] signed the bill accepting the bequest.  The Morrill and Hatch funds were transferred to the [[Clemson University|new agriculture college]] in June 1890, and the University's agricultural department was closed. The vitality of the University was threatened during the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1890|1890 campaign]] when Ben Tillman advocated its closing.  Although he won the election for governor, he completed reorganization of the university as a liberal arts college during his term.<ref>{{cite book | first = Walter B. | last = Edgar | title = South Carolina:  A History | year = 1998 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 439}}</ref>\n\n==College to university, 1891\u20131944==\n\n===Wounded institution===\n[[Image:USCenrollment1891-1944.GIF|right|500px|USC Enrollment]]\nThe University was reorganized as the South Carolina College in 1891, and it struggled to attract students through the rest of the decade.  It was restricted to teaching the subjects of law, literature, classics, and theoretical science.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 161}}</ref>  The prestige of the College had fallen such that in 1893, a proposal was offered in the legislature to close the campus and provide homes for Confederate veterans on it instead.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 169}}</ref>  With enrollment lagging and the state lacking a liberal arts school for women, the legislature passed a bill in 1893 that mandated the College to admit women.  On September 24, 1895, Frances Guignard Gibbes was the first woman to be admitted to the College, and in 1898 Mattie Jean Adams was the first to graduate.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 171}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Tillman had crippled the institution when he became governor, he did not let it die.  The number of students steadily declined from a high of 235 in 1889 to a low of 68 in 1894; but despite the urging of legislators to close it, Tillman ensured through his governorship that the College received an adequate level of funding.  Tillman re-established the [[normal school]] at the College, long dormant since the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  In addition, the legislature authorized adding engineering to the College in 1894 despite a previous prohibition.\n\n===Reemergence as a university===\nThe victory by [[Duncan Clinch Heyward]] in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1902|gubernatorial election of 1902]] marked the end of Tillmanism and the return of support by the governor's office for the institution.  Heyward pushed the legislature to convert the College into a University in 1905 to mark the centennial by providing the state with a capstone for its educational system.  The effort failed when legislators feared that [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] was to be absorbed into the University, but the measure was reintroduced in 1906 and passed on February 17 to charter the institution for the last time as the '''University of South Carolina'''.\n\nFor the next forty years, the institution struggled to find its identity as it cycled through periods of achieving popularity versus academic excellence.  Under the vigorous leadership of President [[Samuel Chiles Mitchell]] from 1909 to 1913, enrollment at the University doubled; he brought the University to the state by setting up [[Continuing education|extension courses]] in 1910.  Incessant criticism by Governor [[Coleman Livingston Blease]] over Mitchell's handling of University affairs led to his resignation and the trustees elected [[William Spenser Currell]] with the intention of raising the level of scholarship at the University.  Entrance requirements were made more stringent and Currell's efforts were rewarded when in 1917 the University became the first state-supported college or university in South Carolina to earn accreditation by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association]].<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 272}}</ref>\n\nThe entrance of America into [[World War I]] was enthusiastically supported by the student body, and the vast majority participated in the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps|ROTC]] unit at the University.  To compensate for the loss of enrollment because of conscription, the [[United States Department of War|war department]] replaced the ROTC program with the [[Student Army Training Corps]].  After the war, the SATC was disbanded and military training was made compulsory for freshman and sophomore students in the ROTC program.  The ROTC program was scrapped in 1921 due to lack of interest.\n\nAn aura of stagnation existed at the University in the early 1920s and the trustees elected [[William Davis Melton]] in 1922 to revive its fortunes.  Melton launched a campaign to popularize the institution by convincing the people of the state that it was not exclusively for the elite or a special interest group, but rather for the masses.  He gained a major increase in the appropriation by the legislature for the University, and in 1924 student enrollment surpassed that of Clemson for the first time.  Following Melton's death in 1926, [[Davison McDowell Douglas]] was elected President to consolidate the gains and tighten academic standards.  The board of trustees called upon [[James Rion McKissick]] in 1936 to return to Melton's policies of popularizing the University.\n\nMcKissick established the University News Service to combat perceived misconceptions of the University and to promote the high moral character of the students.  Due in large part to his efforts, enrollment reached record numbers and the University entered the 1940s with a renewed sense of optimism.  Yet, the world soon became engulfed by [[World War II]]. To help with the loss of enrollment because of mobilization, the University received a [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps|Naval ROTC]] detachment.  The University was quickly transformed into a Naval school when the [[United States Navy|Navy]] set up a [[V-5 Navy Flight Preparatory School]], a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program|Civil Aeronautics Administration-War Training Service]] program, and a [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].  The V-12 program was the most important to the University because the trainees were enrolled in classes; they became active participants in student life and extracurricular activities.\n\n==The State's University, 1944\u2013present==\n\n===New and greater university===\n[[Image:USCenrollment1945-2006.GIF|right|500px|USC enrollment]]\nBy November 1944 it was clear that [[World War II]] would soon be coming to a close and the servicemen would return to enroll in the university in massive numbers due in large part because of the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]].  [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] and trustee of the University [[Solomon Blatt, Sr.|Solomon Blatt]] unveiled a proposal called the \"new and greater university\" plan that would move the university from its present site to a {{convert|1200|acre|km2|adj=on}} site just outside Columbia. At the time, the university was the smallest state university in the South and a larger campus would more easily allow for expansion at much less cost. The idea of a move came from that of the relocation of [[Louisiana State University]] in 1925 and it was envisioned that a new campus would provide the impetus for the University of South Carolina \"to establish itself as a great American state university.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 33}}</ref>\n\nBlatt obtained support from all the key players in the [[politics of South Carolina]] to facilitate the proposal: Governor [[Olin D. Johnston]], Governor-elect [[Ransome Judson Williams]], Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee [[Edgar Allan Brown]], and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee [[Morris Tuten]].  The Board of Trustees approved the plan in December 1944 by a vote of 17\u20132, although complaints were issued from the dissenting voters that the decision was made with too much haste and without any input from the public.  In addition, Blatt chose [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Rear Admiral]] [[Norman Murray Smith]] as the [[Presidents of the University of South Carolina|President of the University]] in large part because he held connections in the political establishments of South Carolina and the federal government necessary to secure funds for the relocation of the university.\n\nHowever, Blatt's proposal caused an intense uproar{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} in the state because alumni and students felt that it would needlessly sever the university from its antebellum tradition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Other complaints arose that the process itself did not allow for public input and it was detested as a product of the [[Barnwell Ring]].  Even with the outpouring of condemnation, municipalities lobbied to have the University moved to their locale such as [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]], [[Cheraw, South Carolina|Cheraw]], [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Manning, South Carolina|Manning]], [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]], [[Kershaw County, South Carolina|Kershaw County]] and [[Oconee County, South Carolina|Oconee County]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 37\u201338}}</ref>  Blatt realized that his proposal in February 1945 would not receive the necessary support in the legislature and he modified it so that the University would expand upon its existing area.  This idea was warmly received by the alumni and students, but it died in the Finance Committee after Senator Edgar Brown declined to take up the matter.\n\nAfter World War II, enrollment at the University swelled from the influx of veterans.  They were wholeheartedly welcomed by President Smith who actively campaigned for their attendance and he announced that every qualified veteran would be admitted to the University.  The vast majority of South Carolina veterans chose to attend the University because of its hospitable atmosphere, but also for other reasons.  They did not want to attend [[Clemson University|Clemson]] or [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] because \"the prospect of returning home to attend a military college was distasteful for the older men leaving the military after fighting the largest war in world history.\"<ref name=\"Lesesne 2001 41\">{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 41}}</ref>  In addition, Clemson's rural location and its self-imposed restriction on the number of students made it inaccessible for a large number of veterans.  The University offered several special programs to meet the needs of the veterans and it continued an accelerated calendar until 1949.  It was at this point in history that the two universities switched reputations and missions.  Carolina became known as the university for the common man and an institution accessible for all whereas Clemson settled into a status of elitism.<ref name=\"Lesesne 2001 41\"/>\n\nPresident Smith faced increasing criticism through his tenure because he failed to articulate a clear policy for the University's future and he did not campaign for the legislature to appropriate enough funds for its needs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} As president of a public university, Smith's chief responsibility was to be its publicist and develop ties with the political power of the state.  Instead, Sol Blatt grew tired of having to carry the burden for the University in the legislature and Governor [[Strom Thurmond|Thurmond]] felt that he received an icy reception from the administration.  In 1952, Smith resigned and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Governor [[James F. Byrnes|Byrnes]], [[Donald S. Russell]], was elected President by the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]].\n\n===Growth and prosperity===\nThe ascendancy of Russell was crucial for the University at a critical moment in its history because he brought youth and dynamic leadership to the Presidency.  His vision for the University was for it to be the capstone of the state's higher education system and for it to be the senior partner to the other state colleges.  Russell's first step toward building a great university was the strengthening of the faculty by bringing in nationally known professors.  Secondly, he improved the academics at the University through the expansion of courses, the revamping of programs and the introduction of [[entrance examination]]s.  A report conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to overhaul the engineering department became the standard used by the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] to accredit all engineering schools.<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 86}}</ref>  In response to the ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the University instituted entrance examinations so as to prevent the mass rush of black high school graduates to enroll at USC.  The examinations were also welcomed because they would promote individual merit over wealth or connections and USC became the first college to introduce entrance examinations.  Thirdly, a massive building and renovation program was initiated and it was made possible through the acquisition of the properties on the southern boundary of the campus.  The renaissance enjoyed by the University became evident by the speakers for commencement addresses and special convocations.  Among the distinguished who came to speak at the University were [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]], and [[John Foster Dulles]].\n\nRussell resigned in 1957 so that he could [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1958|run for governor in 1958]] and [[Robert L. Sumwalt (academic)|Robert L. Sumwalt]] was named as the temporary president by the trustees.  By the end of the summer of 1958, Russell had failed to win the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for governor and the University was still without a permanent President.  A movement was started to bring Russell back as the President and he gave positive indications that he would return as President if offered.  Yet, many were opposed because they felt that Russell was opportunistic and would leave the University again for the next gubernatorial campaign.  Russell had also annoyed many associated with the University through his harsh rhetoric against [[Ernest Hollings]] on the campaign trail.  The board of trustees was split and instead voted unanimously in 1959 to make Sumwalt the permanent President.\n\nAn initiative started by Russell and continued by Sumwalt was the establishment of regional campuses and the formation of the [[University of South Carolina System|University System]].  The first extension campus was set up at [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] in 1957 and additional campuses were gained in [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], [[Lancaster, South Carolina|Lancaster]] and [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]] in 1959.  Another campus was added to the system in 1961 at [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]].  The University System served two purposes, it expanded the University's reach across the state and the branch campuses acted as a feeder system for the main campus in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]].\n\nSumwalt retired in 1962 and he was replaced by [[Thomas F. Jones]] as President.  Immediately, Jones was confronted by the integration problem that the University faced.  Clemson admitted [[Harvey Gantt]] in January 1963 and it was just a matter of time before the University would be forced to admit blacks.  USC exhausted its legal options in the summer and although large sentiment was against the integration of the University, there was no extra resistance to it requiring federal troops as occurred that same summer at the [[University of Alabama]] or at the [[University of Mississippi]] the previous year; the latter of which contained violence which had a dramatic conscientious effect on many segregationists in the University community.  A student leader perhaps best expressed the altered sentiments of many when he wrote that while \"we do not want integration . . . neither do we want to be blamed for the loss of dignity and integrity.\"<ref>Lesesne, Henry H. (2001).  ''A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000.''  University of South Carolina Press. p. 144</ref>  On September 11,  African-Americans Henrie Dobbins Monteith, Robert G. Anderson, and James L. Solomon, Jr. were admitted to the University peacefully.\n\nFor the next two decades following integration, the University experienced rapid growth and expansion due in large part to the [[baby boomer]] generation entering college.  Enrollment stood at 5,660 in 1960, but by 1979 had reached nearly 26,000 students on the Columbia campus alone.  The expansion of the University was not limited to the Columbia campus; additional campuses and colleges were set up throughout the state.  Clemson established an extension center in 1965 at [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]], only {{convert|40|mi|km}} away from Columbia.  Sol Blatt, then the Speaker of the House, wrote President Tom Jones that \"the University should build as many two year colleges over the State as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 178}}</ref>  President Jones heeded Blatt's advice and over the next decade, the University added campuses in [[Allendale, South Carolina|Allendale]], [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Union, South Carolina|Union]] and [[Walterboro, South Carolina|Walterboro]].  The Clemson extension at Sumter never proved popular, and USC acquired the campus in 1973.\n\nThe growth of the University in the 1960s and 70s also brought with it the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social activism and disorder of the time]].  Due to the massive influx of so many students in a short time period, the administration lost control of student life.  Drug and alcohol use became so rampant at the University that it became known as a [[party school]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 194, 272}}</ref>  Black students protested the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1968 by setting fire to Hamilton College and the [[Carolina Fieldhouse|USC Field House]].  On May 7, 1970, approximately 400 students seized the Russell House as a symbolic gesture towards honoring those killed in the [[Kent State shootings]] and four days later on May 11, they attempted to meet with the members of the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|board of trustees]], but were rebuffed. Columbia police were called in to quell the student protest but were ineffective. State troopers were also unable to disperse the students. National Guard troops were ordered to the campus by Gov. Bob McNair, and soon dispersed most of the protestors with tear gas. The inability of the administration to control such student outbursts led to President Jones' resignation in 1974. But he had succeeded in turning a sleepy southern college into a full-fledged research institution.\n\n===International recognition===\n[[James B. Holderman]], a flamboyant and charming executive, was elected President by the board of trustees in 1977.  Right away, Holderman championed a proposal to create an honors college because it would foster an academic environment conducive to excellence necessary to keep South Carolina's best students instate.  The proposal was approved and the first students were admitted into the South Carolina Honors College in 1978.\n\nA persistent problem for the University was the Columbia campus's relationship with the semi-autonomous regional campuses.  Once a campus reached a [[Full-time equivalent]] of 1,000 students, it was entitled to become a four-year college and the campuses in Aiken, Spartanburg, and Conway took advantage of this rule.  The law providing such a transformation was repealed, but it was apparent that the regional campuses were acting in their own interests and not for the University system.  Furthermore, the Columbia campus had to compete against its regional campuses for funding because each campus submitted its budget to the General Assembly.  To correct these problems, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan that outlined a centralized and unified approach to be taken by the University system.  This meant that it would be necessary for lawmakers to fully fund the University system in order for the branch campus to receive the funds they need.  The Carolina Plan worked brilliantly as the University system was fully funded in 1977 for the first time since 1967.\n\nFollowing up on his success with the Carolina Plan, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan II which called for making USC an international university and a \"Window to the World.\"  To achieve his goals, Holderman used his connections and his personal charisma to attract world leaders to the USC campus.  He was able to put USC on the map by bringing in such world leaders as [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]] and many other foreign dignitaries.  The highlight of the visits was that of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1987.  He exclaimed on the Horseshoe that \"it is wonderful to be young and a student at the University of South Carolina.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 281}}</ref>  The Pope later led a non-denominational service before more than 60,000 at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]].\n\nThe international spotlight on the University came at a price and an inquisitive journalism student led to Holderman's downfall.  Paul Perkins, a journalism student upset with tuition increases, requested that the University release the salary of visiting professor [[Jehan Al Sadat|Jehan Sadat]].  Holderman balked and refused to release the details even after Perkins and his wife Cheryl filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.  This denial and the secrecy on the part of the administration led the media to scrutinize other aspects of Holderman's presidency.  They inspected his travel budgets and construction contracts and found overwhelming evidence of financial irregularities and extravagant spending.  In face of all the negative publicity, Holderman resigned in 1990. Holderman would later be convicted of laundering drug money in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19863125_ITM | work=The America's Intelligence Wire | title=Ex-University of South Carolina president sentenced to 3 years | date=December 30, 2003}}</ref> The University trustees elected [[John M. Palms]] to succeed Holderman to restore the institution's credibility and respect in the state and world. After leading the University's bicentennial celebrations in 2001,<ref>[http://www.sc.edu/bicentennial/ University of South Carolina Bicentennial Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Palms retired and was replaced by [[Andrew A. Sorensen]] in 2002. During his tenure from 2002 to 2008, Sorensen raised large sums for research, including a $300 million grant for colorectal cancer. In the spirit of Palms' \"Cathedrals of Excellence\" budgeting philosophy, the board of directors moved to transform university land on Assembly Street into an \"innovation district\" called Innovista that will develop four strengths: biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels. The Board of Trustees announced the selection of [[Harris Pastides]] as the University's 28th president on July 11, 2008. After 11 years as President, Pastides was succeeded by former [[Superintendent of the United States Military Academy|Superintendent]] of West Point [[Robert L. Caslen]] on August 1, 2019.<ref>[https://www.chronicle.com/article/University-of-South-Carolina/246736 University of South Carolina Trustees Vote for Governor\u2019s Pick for President.] The Chronicle of Higher Education.

It was conceived that a state supported college located in the center of the state at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], [[South Carolina]] would foster friendships between those of both regions thus allowing the state to present a united front to the nation when threatened with issues jeopardizing the South Carolina way of life.  The [[University of South Carolina|University of South Carolina's]] history can be described in four distinct phases:  a firebrand college (1801\u20131862), constant reorganization (1865\u20131891), college to university (1891\u20131944) and the state's university (1944\u2013present).\n[[Image:USCHorseshoe1872.jpg|right|500px|thumb|An 1872 illustration of the Horseshoe, USC's original campus.

The establishment of a publicly funded college at the capital was intended to unite and promote harmony between the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] and the [[The Upstate|Backcountry]].  On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. [[Jonathan Maxcy]] was its first president and served until his death in 1820.\n\nWith the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the [[Southern United States|South]] and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including [[Francis Lieber]], [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], and [[Joseph LeConte]].  However, the college suffered greatly and lost most of its prestige when it closed during the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{see also|South Carolina College Cadets}}\nThe students formed a cadet [[Company (military unit)|company]] in December 1860 to aid the Southern cause, but an order by [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Francis Wilkinson Pickens|Pickens]] prevented them from leaving Columbia.  Undeterred, the students disbanded their company on April 12 and formed a new company while en route to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] so that the governor's previous holding orders would be invalid.  Once in Charleston, General [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Beauregard]] assigned the company to guard [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]], much to the dismay of the students who greatly desired to be a part of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]].  After three weeks of guard duty, the student cadet company returned to Columbia to a hero's welcome.\n\nLater in June 1861, the students reformed the company and requested to be accepted for service.  Governor Pickens accepted their request provided that the faculty also approved the venture, but the faculty did not give its consent because they did not want the college to needlessly be closed.  The frustrated students even went as far as negotiating service of their unit with [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], who agreed, but again Governor Pickens denied their use because the faculty was not willing to let them go.\n\nWhen the students returned in October, they reorganized their military unit as the \"third company.\"  The [[Union Army|Union]] attack of the South Carolina coast in November at the [[Battle of Port Royal]] led Governor Pickens to agree to their request to be mustered for active duty, but [[Presidents of the University of South Carolina|President]] [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet|Longstreet]] and the faculty steadfastly maintained their opposition to the students leaving for service.  However, with the support of the governor the students ignored the protests of the faculty and departed for the Lowcountry.  Governor Pickens kept the student company in Charleston to serve as his bodyguard and because the Union forces at Port Royal did not press their advantage, he released the students from military service on December 10.\n\nSeventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned as best it could until a call by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers.  A system of conscription would begin on March 20 for all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, so on March 8 all of the students at the college volunteered for service in order to avoid the dishonor of having been conscripted.  Despite the depletion of students, the professors issued a notice that the college would temporarily close and would reopen to those under eighteen.  When the college reopened on March 17, only nine students showed up for classes and it became quite apparent to all that the college would not last past the end of the term in June.\n\nOn June 25 with the consent of the state government, the Confederate authorities took possession of the college buildings and converted them into a hospital.  After many unsuccessful attempts to reopen the college, the trustees passed a resolution on December 2, 1863 that officially closed the college.  By February 1865, [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] army had reached the outskirts of Columbia and the college was spared from destruction by the Union forces because of its use as a hospital.  In addition, a company of the [[25th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was stationed at the campus on February 17 to protect it from harm and to thwart off pillaging Yankee soldiers.\n\n==Reorganization, 1865\u20131891==\n\n===Radical University===\nThe Union army took possession of the college on May 24, 1865 and although the future for the college under military control, General [[John Porter Hatch]] sent a letter on June 19 to the remaining professors at the college that it should reopen as soon as possible.  The appointment of [[Benjamin Franklin Perry]] as provisional [[governor of South Carolina]] on June 30 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] restored civilian rule to the state.  Perry reinstated the trustees to their positions and the board met on September 20 to authorize the college to reopen on the first Monday of January in 1866.\n\nIn a message to the legislature in October, Perry sought to convert the college into a university because with the state in an impoverished situation, it would provide a more practical education.  The model that he wished to follow was the elective system used by the [[University of Virginia]].  Perry was succeeded in November as governor by [[James Lawrence Orr]], a graduate of the University of Virginia, who also wished to see the college adopt the curriculum of his alma mater.  Little opposition developed to change the College into a university and bill to establish the '''University of South Carolina''' was passed by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on December 19, 1865, sixty-four years after the institution's foundation.\n\nThe schools of the university remained largely the same as they were in the College, with the addition of a school of engineering and mathematics.  For the students, the difference was great because they were given much more freedom than afforded in the College, and they were given the ability to choose their classes rather than having to submit to a compulsory curriculum identical for all.  Perry and Orr believed that the relaxed atmosphere at the University would allow it to prosper and reach three or four hundred students in a few years.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 32}}</ref>\n\nThe reopening of the University was pushed back to January 10 due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings on the campus and to celebrate the anniversary of the original opening of South Carolina College.  Fewer than fifty students attended in the first term, which alarmed Governor Orr.  He recommended to the General Assembly that schools of law and medicine be added, which the legislature established in 1866.  Despite this step, the University faced an ominous future as the state was beginning to undergo [[Radical Reconstruction|Reconstruction]].\n\nAfter [[Radical Republicans]] gained control of the state government in 1868, they sought to integrate the University; the constitution of 1868 had stated that all universities of the state should be \"free and open to all the children and youths of the State, without regard to race and color.\"<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 45}}</ref>  Former Governor Orr urged the legislature to preserve the University as an institution for the whites and to convert the dormant campus of [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] into a college for the blacks.  Governor [[Robert Kingston Scott]] ignored this request and recommended that the legislature bring the University into compliance with the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] to make it qualify as a land grant college and accept federal aid; it had to remove race as an admissions criteria.\n\nThe University Act of 1869 reorganized the University and provided it with generous state financial support.  An amendment was added to the act by [[W. J. Whipper]], a black representative from [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], to prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the University.  The legislature elected two black trustees to the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|governing board of the University]] on March 9, 1869.  [[Franklin J. Moses, Jr.]], state representative and speaker of the house, also supported admission of all races to the state school. In October 1873, [[Henry E. Hayne]], the Republican secretary of state, was admitted as the first black student; he was of mostly white ancestry with a white politician father.\n\nThe admission of black students to the University was inevitable, and three factors contributed to this. First, the University never achieved a level of enrollment that was commensurate with its financial backing by the legislature.  Enrollment never exceeded one hundred students, whereas the enrollment at [[Wofford College]] exceeded that mark in 1870.  White students were believed to avoid the university from fear it would be integrated.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The second reason was the failure of the state to provide an adequate public university for the education of blacks. It was trying to compensate rapidly for the state's failure to educate blacks in the antebellum years. In 1872, funds were allocated for the [[South Carolina State University|Agricultural and Mechanical Institute]] at [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]], but they were badly mismanaged. Black legislators called for the opening of the University to black students. Finally, the [[South Carolina Republican Party|state Republican party]] split for the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1872|election of 1872]] between Radical and moderate factions.  The Radicals won and pressed their advantage by electing four blacks to the Board of Trustees, thus constituting a majority.\n\nThe legislature established a normal school to train teachers for the lower grades on the campus of the University as well as a preparatory school, since most black students of the state had been deprived of strong academic training in years past. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished.  On October 7, 1873, [[Henry E. Hayne]], the [[Secretary of State of South Carolina]], became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the University.<ref>{{cite book | first = John S. | last = Reynolds | title = Reconstruction in South Carolina | url = https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog | year = 1969 | publisher = Negro University Press | pages = [https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog/page/n243 233]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 66}}</ref>  As a result of his enrollment, three professors resigned, and some white students left.\n\nOn October 8, enrollment stood at eight students, seven of whom were the sons of professors.  The number increased to twenty-two students after many politicians registered with the University to show that it was open for both races, yet few of the politicians attended classes.  Troubled by the low enrollment, [[State Treasurer of South Carolina]], [[Francis L. Cardozo]] went to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and persuaded a handful of students at [[Howard University]] to transfer to the University.  Drastic measures were required to increase the number of students and the legislature passed an act in February 1874 to provide for 124 scholarships of $200.  The conservative press denounced this move because with the absence of tuition, it meant that students were effectively being paid to attend the University, but poor students were often critical to family support, and scholarships helped them cover living expenses.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 71}}</ref>  Many of the scholarship students could not meet the entrance requirements into the freshman class, so the faculty assembled them into a sub-freshman class. This plan was abolished in 1875 as the legislature had not authorized it.\n\nThe scholarships achieved their desired effect in increasing enrollment and by 1875, 90% of the student body was black.<ref>{{cite book | first = John S. | last = Reynolds | title = Reconstruction in South Carolina | url = https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog | year = 1969 | publisher = Negro University Press | pages = [https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni00reyngoog/page/n246 236]}}</ref>  The University of South Carolina holds the distinction of being the only state university in the South to admit and grant degrees to black students during Reconstruction.  When the Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876, they quickly acted to end admission of blacks, closing the University on June 7, 1877 by a joint resolution of the General Assembly. They passed legislation authorizing only white students and setting up Claflin College as the state institution for black students.\n\n===Redeemer University===\nIt was far from certain that the University would be reopened and debate ensued in the General Assembly over the necessity of the University.  Many legislators, led by [[Martin Witherspoon Gary]], felt that the state had other obligations and it was not practical for the state to spend money on the University.  In addition, these legislators were from [[the Upstate]] and had no attachment to the University. They were not part of the planter elite and had attended other schools.  An act to reorganize the University was passed by the [[South Carolina Senate|state Senate]] by two votes on March 2, 1878, but it did not provide for the appropriation of funds to the reopening.  The act specified that the University was to consist of two branches, one styled as the South Carolina College in Columbia for the whites and [[Claflin University|Claflin College]] in Orangeburg for the blacks.  In order to mollify agitation by the farming interests, a section of the act specified that an agricultural department was to be established with the University.\n\nOn October 5, 1880 the institution was reopened as the '''South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts''' and largely derived its funding from the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]].  Despite its name as an agriculture and mechanical college, few students showed an interest in either area.  Only nine students worked the {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} college farm for the first session and just twenty-one attended the mechanical shop.  Because the state could not afford a liberal arts University, it took advantage of the Morrill Act in order to acquire federal funds, and offered some agriculture program to satisfy its requirements.\n\nBy 1881, the state's financial situation was markedly improved and Governor [[Johnson Hagood (governor)|Johnson Hagood]] called for greater expenditures on higher education.  With a much higher appropriation, the trustees abolished the farming and mechanical foreman positions, in 1882 restoring the institution to its [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] status as the South Carolina College.  An agriculture department remained, but little of the curriculum was agricultural, and it was essentially identical to the general science program. The department suffered from neglect because its professor, [[John McLauren McBryde]], was also the President of the institution and in that position he focused most of his energies.\n\nIn the latter years of the 1880s, the College increasingly came under attack from religious groups and agricultural interests.  The denominational colleges, struggling to rebuild from the Civil War, demanded that free tuition be ended at the college, and the General Assembly capitulated in 1887 by fixing tuition rates at $40 per year.  Led by [[Benjamin Tillman|Ben Tillman]] [who owned 400 acres as a planter, cultivated by tenant farmers], the agrarians pushed to establish a separate agriculture college because they believed that the College was not providing an adequate education in agriculture.  Despite Tillman's rhetoric, a majority of the students were sons of farmers. At that time, the most advanced agricultural research was being conducted at [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and the [[University of California]], both liberal arts colleges.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 138\u2013139}}</ref>\n\nTo take advantage of the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] and to assuage the concerns of the farmers, the legislature passed an act in 1887 to reorganize the college as the University of South Carolina with six schools and colleges.  An [[agricultural experiment station]] was set up, the college farm was expanded by {{convert|100|acre|km2}}, and a well-developed agriculture program was initiated.  The University was so successful that Ben Tillman announced his retirement from public life.\n\n[[Thomas Green Clemson]] bequeathed his estate in 1888 to establish and endow a separate agriculture college in the state. Tillman reemerged to carry the cause to the legislature and in 1889, Governor [[John Peter Richardson III|Richardson]] signed the bill accepting the bequest.  The Morrill and Hatch funds were transferred to the [[Clemson University|new agriculture college]] in June 1890, and the University's agricultural department was closed. The vitality of the University was threatened during the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1890|1890 campaign]] when Ben Tillman advocated its closing.  Although he won the election for governor, he completed reorganization of the university as a liberal arts college during his term.<ref>{{cite book | first = Walter B. | last = Edgar | title = South Carolina:  A History | year = 1998 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 439}}</ref>\n\n==College to university, 1891\u20131944==\n\n===Wounded institution===\n[[Image:USCenrollment1891-1944.GIF|right|500px|USC Enrollment]]\nThe University was reorganized as the South Carolina College in 1891, and it struggled to attract students through the rest of the decade.  It was restricted to teaching the subjects of law, literature, classics, and theoretical science.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 161}}</ref>  The prestige of the College had fallen such that in 1893, a proposal was offered in the legislature to close the campus and provide homes for Confederate veterans on it instead.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 169}}</ref>  With enrollment lagging and the state lacking a liberal arts school for women, the legislature passed a bill in 1893 that mandated the College to admit women.  On September 24, 1895, Frances Guignard Gibbes was the first woman to be admitted to the College, and in 1898 Mattie Jean Adams was the first to graduate.<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 171}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Tillman had crippled the institution when he became governor, he did not let it die.  The number of students steadily declined from a high of 235 in 1889 to a low of 68 in 1894; but despite the urging of legislators to close it, Tillman ensured through his governorship that the College received an adequate level of funding.  Tillman re-established the [[normal school]] at the College, long dormant since the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  In addition, the legislature authorized adding engineering to the College in 1894 despite a previous prohibition.\n\n===Reemergence as a university===\nThe victory by [[Duncan Clinch Heyward]] in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1902|gubernatorial election of 1902]] marked the end of Tillmanism and the return of support by the governor's office for the institution.  Heyward pushed the legislature to convert the College into a University in 1905 to mark the centennial by providing the state with a capstone for its educational system.  The effort failed when legislators feared that [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] was to be absorbed into the University, but the measure was reintroduced in 1906 and passed on February 17 to charter the institution for the last time as the '''University of South Carolina'''.\n\nFor the next forty years, the institution struggled to find its identity as it cycled through periods of achieving popularity versus academic excellence.  Under the vigorous leadership of President [[Samuel Chiles Mitchell]] from 1909 to 1913, enrollment at the University doubled; he brought the University to the state by setting up [[Continuing education|extension courses]] in 1910.  Incessant criticism by Governor [[Coleman Livingston Blease]] over Mitchell's handling of University affairs led to his resignation and the trustees elected [[William Spenser Currell]] with the intention of raising the level of scholarship at the University.  Entrance requirements were made more stringent and Currell's efforts were rewarded when in 1917 the University became the first state-supported college or university in South Carolina to earn accreditation by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association]].<ref>{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 272}}</ref>\n\nThe entrance of America into [[World War I]] was enthusiastically supported by the student body, and the vast majority participated in the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps|ROTC]] unit at the University.  To compensate for the loss of enrollment because of conscription, the [[United States Department of War|war department]] replaced the ROTC program with the [[Student Army Training Corps]].  After the war, the SATC was disbanded and military training was made compulsory for freshman and sophomore students in the ROTC program.  The ROTC program was scrapped in 1921 due to lack of interest.\n\nAn aura of stagnation existed at the University in the early 1920s and the trustees elected [[William Davis Melton]] in 1922 to revive its fortunes.  Melton launched a campaign to popularize the institution by convincing the people of the state that it was not exclusively for the elite or a special interest group, but rather for the masses.  He gained a major increase in the appropriation by the legislature for the University, and in 1924 student enrollment surpassed that of Clemson for the first time.  Following Melton's death in 1926, [[Davison McDowell Douglas]] was elected President to consolidate the gains and tighten academic standards.  The board of trustees called upon [[James Rion McKissick]] in 1936 to return to Melton's policies of popularizing the University.\n\nMcKissick established the University News Service to combat perceived misconceptions of the University and to promote the high moral character of the students.  Due in large part to his efforts, enrollment reached record numbers and the University entered the 1940s with a renewed sense of optimism.  Yet, the world soon became engulfed by [[World War II]]. To help with the loss of enrollment because of mobilization, the University received a [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps|Naval ROTC]] detachment.  The University was quickly transformed into a Naval school when the [[United States Navy|Navy]] set up a [[V-5 Navy Flight Preparatory School]], a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program|Civil Aeronautics Administration-War Training Service]] program, and a [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].  The V-12 program was the most important to the University because the trainees were enrolled in classes; they became active participants in student life and extracurricular activities.\n\n==The State's University, 1944\u2013present==\n\n===New and greater university===\n[[Image:USCenrollment1945-2006.GIF|right|500px|USC enrollment]]\nBy November 1944 it was clear that [[World War II]] would soon be coming to a close and the servicemen would return to enroll in the university in massive numbers due in large part because of the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]].  [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] and trustee of the University [[Solomon Blatt, Sr.|Solomon Blatt]] unveiled a proposal called the \"new and greater university\" plan that would move the university from its present site to a {{convert|1200|acre|km2|adj=on}} site just outside Columbia. At the time, the university was the smallest state university in the South and a larger campus would more easily allow for expansion at much less cost. The idea of a move came from that of the relocation of [[Louisiana State University]] in 1925 and it was envisioned that a new campus would provide the impetus for the University of South Carolina \"to establish itself as a great American state university.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 33}}</ref>\n\nBlatt obtained support from all the key players in the [[politics of South Carolina]] to facilitate the proposal: Governor [[Olin D. Johnston]], Governor-elect [[Ransome Judson Williams]], Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee [[Edgar Allan Brown]], and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee [[Morris Tuten]].  The Board of Trustees approved the plan in December 1944 by a vote of 17\u20132, although complaints were issued from the dissenting voters that the decision was made with too much haste and without any input from the public.  In addition, Blatt chose [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Rear Admiral]] [[Norman Murray Smith]] as the [[Presidents of the University of South Carolina|President of the University]] in large part because he held connections in the political establishments of South Carolina and the federal government necessary to secure funds for the relocation of the university.\n\nHowever, Blatt's proposal caused an intense uproar{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} in the state because alumni and students felt that it would needlessly sever the university from its antebellum tradition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Other complaints arose that the process itself did not allow for public input and it was detested as a product of the [[Barnwell Ring]].  Even with the outpouring of condemnation, municipalities lobbied to have the University moved to their locale such as [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]], [[Cheraw, South Carolina|Cheraw]], [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Manning, South Carolina|Manning]], [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]], [[Kershaw County, South Carolina|Kershaw County]] and [[Oconee County, South Carolina|Oconee County]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 37\u201338}}</ref>  Blatt realized that his proposal in February 1945 would not receive the necessary support in the legislature and he modified it so that the University would expand upon its existing area.  This idea was warmly received by the alumni and students, but it died in the Finance Committee after Senator Edgar Brown declined to take up the matter.\n\nAfter World War II, enrollment at the University swelled from the influx of veterans.  They were wholeheartedly welcomed by President Smith who actively campaigned for their attendance and he announced that every qualified veteran would be admitted to the University.  The vast majority of South Carolina veterans chose to attend the University because of its hospitable atmosphere, but also for other reasons.  They did not want to attend [[Clemson University|Clemson]] or [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] because \"the prospect of returning home to attend a military college was distasteful for the older men leaving the military after fighting the largest war in world history.\"<ref name=\"Lesesne 2001 41\">{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 41}}</ref>  In addition, Clemson's rural location and its self-imposed restriction on the number of students made it inaccessible for a large number of veterans.  The University offered several special programs to meet the needs of the veterans and it continued an accelerated calendar until 1949.  It was at this point in history that the two universities switched reputations and missions.  Carolina became known as the university for the common man and an institution accessible for all whereas Clemson settled into a status of elitism.<ref name=\"Lesesne 2001 41\"/>\n\nPresident Smith faced increasing criticism through his tenure because he failed to articulate a clear policy for the University's future and he did not campaign for the legislature to appropriate enough funds for its needs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} As president of a public university, Smith's chief responsibility was to be its publicist and develop ties with the political power of the state.  Instead, Sol Blatt grew tired of having to carry the burden for the University in the legislature and Governor [[Strom Thurmond|Thurmond]] felt that he received an icy reception from the administration.  In 1952, Smith resigned and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Governor [[James F. Byrnes|Byrnes]], [[Donald S. Russell]], was elected President by the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]].\n\n===Growth and prosperity===\nThe ascendancy of Russell was crucial for the University at a critical moment in its history because he brought youth and dynamic leadership to the Presidency.  His vision for the University was for it to be the capstone of the state's higher education system and for it to be the senior partner to the other state colleges.  Russell's first step toward building a great university was the strengthening of the faculty by bringing in nationally known professors.  Secondly, he improved the academics at the University through the expansion of courses, the revamping of programs and the introduction of [[entrance examination]]s.  A report conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to overhaul the engineering department became the standard used by the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] to accredit all engineering schools.<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 86}}</ref>  In response to the ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the University instituted entrance examinations so as to prevent the mass rush of black high school graduates to enroll at USC.  The examinations were also welcomed because they would promote individual merit over wealth or connections and USC became the first college to introduce entrance examinations.  Thirdly, a massive building and renovation program was initiated and it was made possible through the acquisition of the properties on the southern boundary of the campus.  The renaissance enjoyed by the University became evident by the speakers for commencement addresses and special convocations.  Among the distinguished who came to speak at the University were [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]], and [[John Foster Dulles]].\n\nRussell resigned in 1957 so that he could [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1958|run for governor in 1958]] and [[Robert L. Sumwalt (academic)|Robert L. Sumwalt]] was named as the temporary president by the trustees.  By the end of the summer of 1958, Russell had failed to win the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for governor and the University was still without a permanent President.  A movement was started to bring Russell back as the President and he gave positive indications that he would return as President if offered.  Yet, many were opposed because they felt that Russell was opportunistic and would leave the University again for the next gubernatorial campaign.  Russell had also annoyed many associated with the University through his harsh rhetoric against [[Ernest Hollings]] on the campaign trail.  The board of trustees was split and instead voted unanimously in 1959 to make Sumwalt the permanent President.\n\nAn initiative started by Russell and continued by Sumwalt was the establishment of regional campuses and the formation of the [[University of South Carolina System|University System]].  The first extension campus was set up at [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] in 1957 and additional campuses were gained in [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], [[Lancaster, South Carolina|Lancaster]] and [[Conway, South Carolina|Conway]] in 1959.  Another campus was added to the system in 1961 at [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]].  The University System served two purposes, it expanded the University's reach across the state and the branch campuses acted as a feeder system for the main campus in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]].\n\nSumwalt retired in 1962 and he was replaced by [[Thomas F. Jones]] as President.  Immediately, Jones was confronted by the integration problem that the University faced.  Clemson admitted [[Harvey Gantt]] in January 1963 and it was just a matter of time before the University would be forced to admit blacks.  USC exhausted its legal options in the summer and although large sentiment was against the integration of the University, there was no extra resistance to it requiring federal troops as occurred that same summer at the [[University of Alabama]] or at the [[University of Mississippi]] the previous year; the latter of which contained violence which had a dramatic conscientious effect on many segregationists in the University community.  A student leader perhaps best expressed the altered sentiments of many when he wrote that while \"we do not want integration . . . neither do we want to be blamed for the loss of dignity and integrity.\"<ref>Lesesne, Henry H. (2001).  ''A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000.''  University of South Carolina Press. p. 144</ref>  On September 11,  African-Americans Henrie Dobbins Monteith, Robert G. Anderson, and James L. Solomon, Jr. were admitted to the University peacefully.\n\nFor the next two decades following integration, the University experienced rapid growth and expansion due in large part to the [[baby boomer]] generation entering college.  Enrollment stood at 5,660 in 1960, but by 1979 had reached nearly 26,000 students on the Columbia campus alone.  The expansion of the University was not limited to the Columbia campus; additional campuses and colleges were set up throughout the state.  Clemson established an extension center in 1965 at [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]], only {{convert|40|mi|km}} away from Columbia.  Sol Blatt, then the Speaker of the House, wrote President Tom Jones that \"the University should build as many two year colleges over the State as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 178}}</ref>  President Jones heeded Blatt's advice and over the next decade, the University added campuses in [[Allendale, South Carolina|Allendale]], [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Union, South Carolina|Union]] and [[Walterboro, South Carolina|Walterboro]].  The Clemson extension at Sumter never proved popular, and USC acquired the campus in 1973.\n\nThe growth of the University in the 1960s and 70s also brought with it the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social activism and disorder of the time]].  Due to the massive influx of so many students in a short time period, the administration lost control of student life.  Drug and alcohol use became so rampant at the University that it became known as a [[party school]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 194, 272}}</ref>  Black students protested the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1968 by setting fire to Hamilton College and the [[Carolina Fieldhouse|USC Field House]].  On May 7, 1970, approximately 400 students seized the Russell House as a symbolic gesture towards honoring those killed in the [[Kent State shootings]] and four days later on May 11, they attempted to meet with the members of the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|board of trustees]], but were rebuffed. Columbia police were called in to quell the student protest but were ineffective. State troopers were also unable to disperse the students. National Guard troops were ordered to the campus by Gov. Bob McNair, and soon dispersed most of the protestors with tear gas. The inability of the administration to control such student outbursts led to President Jones' resignation in 1974. But he had succeeded in turning a sleepy southern college into a full-fledged research institution.\n\n===International recognition===\n[[James B. Holderman]], a flamboyant and charming executive, was elected President by the board of trustees in 1977.  Right away, Holderman championed a proposal to create an honors college because it would foster an academic environment conducive to excellence necessary to keep South Carolina's best students instate.  The proposal was approved and the first students were admitted into the South Carolina Honors College in 1978.\n\nA persistent problem for the University was the Columbia campus's relationship with the semi-autonomous regional campuses.  Once a campus reached a [[Full-time equivalent]] of 1,000 students, it was entitled to become a four-year college and the campuses in Aiken, Spartanburg, and Conway took advantage of this rule.  The law providing such a transformation was repealed, but it was apparent that the regional campuses were acting in their own interests and not for the University system.  Furthermore, the Columbia campus had to compete against its regional campuses for funding because each campus submitted its budget to the General Assembly.  To correct these problems, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan that outlined a centralized and unified approach to be taken by the University system.  This meant that it would be necessary for lawmakers to fully fund the University system in order for the branch campus to receive the funds they need.  The Carolina Plan worked brilliantly as the University system was fully funded in 1977 for the first time since 1967.\n\nFollowing up on his success with the Carolina Plan, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan II which called for making USC an international university and a \"Window to the World.\"  To achieve his goals, Holderman used his connections and his personal charisma to attract world leaders to the USC campus.  He was able to put USC on the map by bringing in such world leaders as [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]] and many other foreign dignitaries.  The highlight of the visits was that of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1987.  He exclaimed on the Horseshoe that \"it is wonderful to be young and a student at the University of South Carolina.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940\u20132000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 281}}</ref>  The Pope later led a non-denominational service before more than 60,000 at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]].\n\nThe international spotlight on the University came at a price and an inquisitive journalism student led to Holderman's downfall.  Paul Perkins, a journalism student upset with tuition increases, requested that the University release the salary of visiting professor [[Jehan Al Sadat|Jehan Sadat]].  Holderman balked and refused to release the details even after Perkins and his wife Cheryl filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.  This denial and the secrecy on the part of the administration led the media to scrutinize other aspects of Holderman's presidency.  They inspected his travel budgets and construction contracts and found overwhelming evidence of financial irregularities and extravagant spending.  In face of all the negative publicity, Holderman resigned in 1990. Holderman would later be convicted of laundering drug money in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19863125_ITM | work=The America's Intelligence Wire | title=Ex-University of South Carolina president sentenced to 3 years | date=December 30, 2003}}</ref> The University trustees elected [[John M. Palms]] to succeed Holderman to restore the institution's credibility and respect in the state and world. After leading the University's bicentennial celebrations in 2001,<ref>[http://www.sc.edu/bicentennial/ University of South Carolina Bicentennial Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Palms retired and was replaced by [[Andrew A. Sorensen]] in 2002. During his tenure from 2002 to 2008, Sorensen raised large sums for research, including a $300 million grant for colorectal cancer. In the spirit of Palms' \"Cathedrals of Excellence\" budgeting philosophy, the board of directors moved to transform university land on Assembly Street into an \"innovation district\" called Innovista that will develop four strengths: biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels. The Board of Trustees announced the selection of [[Harris Pastides]] as the University's 28th president on July 11, 2008. After 11 years as President, Pastides was succeeded by former [[Superintendent of the United States Military Academy|Superintendent]] of West Point [[Robert L. Caslen]] on August 1, 2019.<ref>[https://www.chronicle.com/article/University-of-South-Carolina/246736 University of South Carolina Trustees Vote for Governor\u2019s Pick for President.] The Chronicle of Higher Education.

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>.\n\n<br />\n\n==Teaching==\n{{unreferenced section}}\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90% of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm</ref>\n\n==Health Education Code of Ethics==\nThe Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

She graduated from the University of Ireland in 1939 and received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949. She received her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n==Health Education Worldwide==\n===Romania===\nSince 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies.\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Shokuiku]] ([[Kanji]]: \u98df\u80b2) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for \"[[food]] [[education]]\". The law defines it as the \"acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]\".\n\nIt was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.<ref>http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046%2809%2900149-3/abstract</ref>\n\nMajor concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:\n* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.\n* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html|title=shokuiku - Buzzword - Trends in Japan - Web Japan|author=|date=|website=web-japan.org}}</ref>\n* Families not eating meals together.\n\nClasses in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.<ref>Mark Frank. \"[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]\".

A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90% of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm</ref>\n\n==Health Education Code of Ethics==\nThe Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

She graduated from the University of Ireland in 1939 and received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949. She received her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n==Health Education Worldwide==\n===Romania===\nSince 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies.\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Shokuiku]] ([[Kanji]]: \u98df\u80b2) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for \"[[food]] [[education]]\". The law defines it as the \"acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]\".\n\nIt was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.<ref>http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046%2809%2900149-3/abstract</ref>\n\nMajor concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:\n* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.\n* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html|title=shokuiku - Buzzword - Trends in Japan - Web Japan|author=|date=|website=web-japan.org}}</ref>\n* Families not eating meals together.\n\nClasses in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.<ref>Mark Frank. \"[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]\".

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk.<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>\n\nAt the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup> times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4&nbsp;to&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/><ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/> thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion. However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time.<ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently-analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/><ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain. Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter. Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10\u2013100 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]]).<ref name=\"Kennedy2011\"/> If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring,<ref name=\"Boley2012\"/> it could be anywhere between several times the mass of [[Mars]] to slightly more massive than Earth.\n\nIf Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old.<ref name=\"Mamajek2012\">{{Cite journal |title=On the Age and Binarity of Fomalhaut |first=Eric |last=Mamajek |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2012 |arxiv = 1206.6353|bibcode = 2012ApJ...754L..20M |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/754/2/L20 |volume=754 |pages=L20}}</ref> Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young,<ref name=\"Currie\"/> perhaps having formed within the last few centuries.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\n== Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut ==\n\nFomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time.<ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently-analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/><ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain. Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter. Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10\u2013100 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]]).<ref name=\"Kennedy2011\"/> If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring,<ref name=\"Boley2012\"/> it could be anywhere between several times the mass of [[Mars]] to slightly more massive than Earth.\n\nIf Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old.<ref name=\"Mamajek2012\">{{Cite journal |title=On the Age and Binarity of Fomalhaut |first=Eric |last=Mamajek |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2012 |arxiv = 1206.6353|bibcode = 2012ApJ...754L..20M |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/754/2/L20 |volume=754 |pages=L20}}</ref> Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young,<ref name=\"Currie\"/> perhaps having formed within the last few centuries.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\n== Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut ==\n\nFomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult.

On Saturday, 28 March, it began regular broadcasting at noon on 197.3 metres/1520&nbsp;kHz (announced as 199 metres) with the opening conducted by [[Simon Dee]].<ref>name=\"Henry/von Joel\"</ref> The first programme, which was pre-recorded, was hosted by [[Christopher Moore (DJ)|Chris Moore]].  Radio Caroline's first musical theme was [[Jimmy McGriff]]'s \"Round Midnight\", a [[jazz standard]] co-composed by [[Thelonious Monk]]. In March 1964, [[The Fortunes]] recorded ''Caroline'', which became the station's theme. ''Round Midnight'' was confined to closedown on Radio Caroline North after [[The World Tomorrow (radio and television)|''The World Tomorrow'']]. The station's slogan was ''Your all-day music station'', and it initially broadcast from 6{{nbsp}}a.m. to 6{{nbsp}}p.m., seven days a week.\n\nRadio Caroline announced a wavelength of 199 metres (UK stations stated their wavelength, rather than frequency), rhyming with the name, but was actually broadcasting on 197.3 metres (1520&nbsp;kHz). Radios at that time were tuned using an analogue dial, which allowed for some leeway between the precise transmission frequency and that announced on the air. The Dutch offshore station [[Radio Veronica]] was on 192 metres (1562&nbsp;kHz) and [[Radio Atlanta]] broadcast on 201 (1493&nbsp;kHz).\n\nRadio Caroline's transmission output was almost 20&nbsp;[[kW]], achieved by linking two 10&nbsp;kW [[Continental Electronics]] transmitters. Broadcasting hours were 6{{nbsp}}a.m. to 6{{nbsp}}p.m. to avoid competition from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], which began transmissions at  6{{nbsp}}p.m. The station returned at 8{{nbsp}}p.m. and continued until after midnight to avoid competition with popular television programmes. Most of Radio Caroline's [[pop music]] programmes were targeted at housewives, and some later programming was aimed at children. Without serious competition, Radio Caroline gained a regular daytime audience of some 7 million.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clark|first=Ray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DoTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT123&dq=Radio+Caroline++audience+10+million.&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwil9dizorHoAhWChHIEHQQMDA8Q6AEwAnoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=%2010%20million.&f=false|title=Radio Caroline: The True Story of the Boat that Rocked|date=2014-02-03|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7509-5473-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Merger with Radio Atlanta===\n[[File:ERosko.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Emperor Rosko|Emperor Rosko]]\nOn 2 July 1964, Radio Atlanta and Radio Caroline's companies, ''Project Atlanta'' and ''Planet Productions.'', announced the stations were to merge, with Crawford and O'Rahilly as joint managing directors. Radio Atlanta closed at 8{{nbsp}}p.m. that day. It was renamed '''Radio Caroline South''' and MV ''Mi Amigo'' remained off [[Frinton-on-Sea]] while MV ''Caroline'' broadcast as '''Radio Caroline North'''. MV ''Caroline'' sailed from [[Felixstowe]] to the [[Isle of Man]], broadcasting as she went. The only broadcast staff on board were [[Tom Lodge]] and [[Jerry Leighton]]. MV ''Caroline'' arrived at her new anchorage on the southern tip of the [[Bahama Bank]], Ramsey Bay, on 6 July 1964,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cameraimages.co.uk/page22.html|title=RADIO AT SEA 1|website=www.cameraimages.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref> at a position formerly occupied by the [[Bahama Bank Lightship]]. The two stations were able to cover most of the British Isles. Later, some programmes were pre-recorded on land and broadcast simultaneously from both ships.\n\nIn October 1965, O'Rahilly bought Crawford's interest in the MV ''Mi Amigo'' and engaged [[Tom Lodge]] from Radio Caroline North to make programme changes and regain the audience from [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. Lodge hired new DJs and introduced free-form programming which, by August 1966, had succeeded, creating an audience of 23 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nWhen the US-backed Radio London arrived off the coast of England, there was an unsuccessful attempt to merge its sales operation with that of Caroline before Radio London started transmissions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. The new station introduced British audiences to slick American-style top 40 radio with electronic jingles produced by Dallas-based [[PAMS]], and was an immediate success.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Broadcasting personnel===\nRadio Caroline's first programme, on 28 March 1964, was presented by [[Christopher Moore (DJ)|Chris Moore]].<ref name=\"Radio Caroline North\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/caroline/jimmurphy/history.htm |title=Radio Caroline North |year=1992 |work=Selling the Sixties |first=Robert |last=Chapman |isbn=0-415-07817-2 |publisher=Routledge |accessdate=3 December 2009}}</ref> Presenters [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Roger Gale]], [[Mike Allen (radio presenter)|Mike Allen]], [[Ray Teret]], [[Roger Day]], [[Simon Dee]], [[Tony Prince]], [[Spangles Muldoon]], [[Keith Skues]], [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Robbie Dale]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Tommy Vance]], [[Tom Edwards (broadcaster)|Tom Edwards]], Paul Noble, [[Bob Stewart (radio presenter)|Bob Stewart]] and [[Andy Archer (radio presenter)|Andy Archer]] became well known. Some DJs from the [[United States|USA]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, such as [[Graham Webb (broadcaster)|Graham Webb]], [[Emperor Rosko]], Steve Young, [[Keith Hampshire]], Colin Nicol and Norman St John, were also heard. DJ [[Jack Spector]], of the [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] \"Good Guys\" in New York, regularly recorded for Radio Caroline. Syndicated shows from the US and recorded religious programmes were also broadcast. [[BBC Radio 2]] newsreader [[Colin Berry]] and [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]'s Nick Bailey started their careers reading the news on Radio Caroline South.\n\n[[File:Tom Lodge 1966 - 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Lodge]] was a radio disc jockey for Radio Caroline from 1964 until his death in 2012]]\nIn mid-September 1965, the crew and DJs on MV ''Mi Amigo'' were joined for the weekend by 1960s pop singer [[Sylvan Whittingham]], who visited the ship to promote her single \"We Don't Belong\". Whittingham was unable to leave on the tender when a storm arose. The only singer to stay overnight, she helped present programmes, make jingles, and close the station at night.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/odds52.htm\n|title = The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame: Sylvan the Stowaway\n|publisher = Offshoreradio.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===''Mi Amigo'' runs aground===\nOn 20 January 1966, the MV ''Mi Amigo'' lost its anchor in a storm, drifted and ran aground on the beach at Frinton-on-Sea. The crew and broadcasting staff were rescued unharmed, but the ship's hull was damaged and repairs were carried out at [[Zaandam]], Netherlands. Between 31 January and 1 May, Radio Caroline South broadcast from the vessel ''Cheeta II'', owned by [[Britt Wadner]] of Swedish offshore station [[Radio Syd]], which was off the air because of pack ice in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> The ''Cheeta II'' was equipped for FM broadcasting, so it was fitted with the 10&nbsp;kW transmitter from the ''Mi Amigo'', feeding a makeshift antenna. The resulting signal was low-powered, but ensured that Caroline South's advertising revenue would continue.\n\nThe ''Mi Amigo'' returned to its Frinton-on-Sea anchorage with a redesigned antenna and a new 50&nbsp;kW transmitter and attempted to resume broadcasting on 18 April, nominally on 259 metres to enable the same jingles as Radio Caroline North on 1169&nbsp;kHz to be used, but actually 252 metres. The transmitter was initially too powerful for the antenna insulators. On 27 April, the ''Mi Amigo'' was fully operational.\n\nRadio Caroline South's 259 metres signal was now near those of Radio London on 266m (1133&nbsp;kHz) and the [[BBC Light Programme|BBC's Light Programme]] on 247m (1214&nbsp;kHz). Radio Caroline North subsequently moved to 257m (1169&nbsp;kHz) but also called it 259.\n\n===Radio City affair===\nIn October 1965, negotiations began for Radio Caroline to take over [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]], which broadcast from [[Shivering Sands Army Fort]], a Second World War [[Maunsell Sea Forts|marine fort]] off the [[Kent]]<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> coast. One of Radio Caroline's directors, Major [[Oliver Smedley]], formerly of Radio Atlanta, entered a partnership with Radio City's owner, pop group manager [[Reginald Calvert]] and installed a more powerful transmitter on the fort. However, according to Gerry Bishop's book ''Offshore Radio'' this transmitter was antiquated and failed to work. Smedley later withdrew from the deal.<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article7053070.ece\n|title = Dorothy Calvert: Rock\u2019n\u2019roll entrepreneur and pirate radio pioneer\n|date = 8 March 2010\n|publisher = Times Newspapers Ltd\n|accessdate = 17 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 June 1966, Smedley boarded the Shivering Sands Fort with 10 workmen to repossess a transmitter that he had supplied, but had not been paid for. The next day, Calvert visited Smedley's home in Saffron Walden, Essex, to demand the departure of the raiders and the return of vital transmitter parts. During a violent struggle, Calvert was shot dead. Smedley's men occupied the fort until 22 June.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\nSmedley was charged with Calvert's murder on 18 July, but this was reduced to a charge of manslaughter. Smedley's trial opened on 11 October at Chemlsford Assizes, where the jury acquitted him.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\n===Legislation===\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name             = Radio Caroline International\n| area             = Southern England, western Europe, Northern England, Ireland and Scotland\n| airdate          = 15 August 1967 following passage of the Marine Offences Act\n| frequency        = wavelengths announced as \"259\" metres\n| format           = popular music and news\n| power            = 50 kW\n| owner            = Legal status unclear due to a need to conceal actual legal ownership.\n}}\n\nIn 1967, the UK Government enacted the [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]], outlawing advertising on or supplying an unlicensed offshore radio station from the UK. In an earlier House of Commons debate (in June 1966), the government had claimed that the pirate ships were a danger because of radio frequency interference to emergency shipping channels, and to overseas radio stations and the pirates were paying no royalties to artists, composers or record companies. Furthermore, it was stated that the pirates' use of wavelengths also broke international agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jun/22/wireless-and-television-pirate-stations |title=WIRELESS AND TELEVISION (PIRATE STATIONS) (Hansard, 22 June 1966) |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=22 June 1966 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> The Manx parliament, the [[Tynwald]], attempted to exclude the North ship from the legislation, appealing to the European Court on the legality of the act being applied to the [[Isle of Man]]. Two ([[Radio 270]] and Radio London) of the remaining four UK-based offshore stations closed, but the two Caroline ships continued with their supply operation moved to Netherlands waters, where unlicensed ship-based broadcasting was not outlawed until 1974.\n\nWhen Marine &c. Broadcasting Offences Act become law on 14 August 1967, Radio Caroline was renamed Radio Caroline International. Six weeks later, the [[BBC]] introduced its new national pop station [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], modelled largely on the successful offshore station Radio London, and employed many of the ex-pirate DJs. The [[BBC Light Programme|BBC Light]], [[BBC Third Programme|Third]], and [[BBC Home Service|Home]] programmes became [[BBC Radio 2|Radios 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|4]] respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&page=1 | work = Daily Telegraph | title = The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1| date = 27 September 2007 | author = Imogen Carter | accessdate = 30 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1968, the radio ships ''Mi Amigo'' and ''Caroline'', were boarded and seized before the day's broadcasting began. They were towed to Amsterdam by a salvage company to secure unpaid bills for servicing by the Dutch tender company [[Wijsmuller Transport]]<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\nBecause of the rise of land-based pirate stations after the MOA became law (usually stations run from bedrooms or outdoor sheds with small wattage transmitters), at least two stations broadcast using the Caroline name, one based in Dublin. These broadcasts took place between 1970 and 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dxarchive.com/ireland_a_to_z_irish_pirates_radio_caroline_dublin_1970.html|title=RADIO CAROLINE DUBLIN|website=dxarchive.com|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==1970: Radio North Sea International==\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name             = Radio Caroline International\n| area             = Broadcasting from various locations offshore to Western Europe\n| airdate          = Sat 13 June \u2013 Fri 19 June 1970\n| frequency        = 244m MW, 100.0 MHz FM, 6205 kHz SW\n| format           = popular music and news\n| power            = 105 kW MW\n| erp              = 90 kW MW\n| owner            = Mebo Ltd\n| affiliations     = A brief name change from Radio North Sea International during the UK General Election campaign, after which the station reverted to its original name.\n}}\n\nOn 24 March 1970, a radio ship named {{MV|Mebo II||2}} anchored off the east coast of England during the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]] campaign, broadcasting as [[Radio North Sea International]] (RNI). RNI operated on medium wave, short wave and FM. Its medium wave transmission was [[Radio jamming|jammed]] by the UK authorities and on 13 June, RNI changed its name to Radio Caroline International with co-operation from Ronan O'Rahilly. Radio Caroline lobbied against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and for the introduction of licensed commercial radio in the United Kingdom. Following the election, RNI resumed its original name but jamming continued under the newly-elected Conservative government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_4.html|title=Caroline continues alone, is overwhelmed by difficulties but returns to punish the politicians|publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> It was not until RNI returned to its original anchorage off the Netherlands that the jamming ceased.\n\n==Caroline Television==\nNews stories appeared in Europe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/ctv.htm |title=Caroline TV \u2013 the press cuttings |publisher=Offshoreradio.co.uk |date=30 June 1970 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> announcing the start of Caroline Television<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherishedtelevision.co.uk/caroline.html |title=Caroline Television |publisher=Cherishedtelevision.co.uk |date=16 February 1970 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> from two [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]] aircraft using [[Stratovision]] technology.

O'Rahilly promised financial backing if van Dam could return the ship to broadcasting condition.<ref name=\"Noakes\">{{cite book\n|title = Last of the Pirates: A saga of everyday life on board Radio Caroline\n|author = Noakes, Bob\n|publisher = Paul Harris Publishing\n|place = Edinburgh\n|year = 1984}}</ref> The ship anchored off the Dutch coastal resort of [[Scheveningen]] and was serviced and operated from the Netherlands. That autumn various tests, consisting of continuous music, were made on 259 metres. The station restarted just before Christmas as Radio 199 but soon became Radio Caroline, with a Top 40 format. DJs Chris Cary, broadcasting as [[Spangles Muldoon]] (who was also station manager), [[Roger Day|Roger 'Twiggy' Day]], Andy Archer, [[Paul Rusling|Paul Alexander]], [[Steve England]], Johnny Jason and Peter Chicago (real name Peter Murtha)<ref name=\"Noakes\" /> manned the station.\n\nIn late 1972, Radio Caroline had money problems. On 28 December, unpaid crew cut the ''Mi Amigo'''s generator fuel line and departed. Later that day, the Dutch Royal Navy returned the crew and fighting broke out on board. Two days later, ''Mi Amigo'' was towed to [[IJmuiden]] and seized because of unpaid bills.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> Because of the Christmas holidays, no solicitors were available to issue a writ and the ship lay in Amsterdam harbour until O'Rahilly arranged for it to be towed back to sea. The ship was further delayed by hull damage, and repaired before writs could be issued.<ref name=\"Noakes\" />\n\nBetween 11 and 20 April 1973, the ship broadcast for Radio Veronica while its ship, the ''[[MV Norderney|Norderney]]'', was aground. Because of a law that allows pirates in distress to come ashore without arrest, the running aground had no consequences for the crew.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> During summer 1973, it broadcast separate stations in English and Dutch simultaneously, on 389 m / 773&nbsp;kHz and 252 m (announced as 259) / 1187&nbsp;kHz. Two aerials and twin transmitters were used for about six weeks until the aerial mast failed. To accommodate the second aerial, a second short mast, just in front of the bridge, was employed as the other end of the aerial fixed to the main mast.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Radio Atlantis and Radio Seagull===\n{{main|Radio Atlantis}}\nAround this time, O'Rahilly decided Caroline should adopt an album format similar to [[progressive rock (radio format)|FM progressive rock]] stations in the US, an audience not catered for in Europe. This service was Radio Seagull and broadcast live during the evening.\n\nSince Radio Caroline could not find enough advertising, it shared its nominal 259-metre wavelength (actually 1187&nbsp;kHz or 253 metres) with Dutch-language pop stations. The first was a Belgian station called [[Radio Atlantis]], owned by Belgian businessman Adriaan van Landschoot. Programmes were recorded on land and broadcast between 6{{nbsp}}a.m. and 7{{nbsp}}p.m. Rough weather sometimes prevented tapes from arriving and old programmes had to be repeated. Later in 1973, when the contract with Radio Caroline ended, the crew of Radio Atlantis moved to their own ship, the {{MV|Jeanine}}.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\nRadio Seagull became Radio Caroline on 23 February 1974, retaining the album format. Throughout most of the 1970s, Radio Caroline could be heard only at night, calling itself \"Europe's first and only album station\".\n\n===Radio Mi Amigo===\nAnother Belgian station, '''Radio Mi Amigo International''', launched on 1 January 1974; it was run by Belgian businessman and [[Waffle|Suzy Waffles]] owner [[Sylvain Tack]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/Sylvain%20Tack.htm |title=Tribute to Sylvain Tack |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> The station's offices and studios were in [[Brakel]], Belgium, but moved to [[Castell-Platja d'Aro]], Costa Brava, Spain in March 1975 after a raid by Belgian police. Here they produced programmes for Dutch-speaking holidaymakers, mostly [[Europop]], [[Top 40]], [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] and Dutch language popular music presented by Belgian, Dutch and occasionally English DJs with frequent commercials. Because commercial radio was prohibited in Belgium, Radio Mi Amigo had little competition from the former BRT State Radio and TV (today VRT Flemisch State radio and TV) and became very popular in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. For the first years, advertising on the station was in demand. When [[Radio Veronica]] closed in 1974, some presenters moved to Radio Mi Amigo.\n\n===Loving Awareness===\nCaroline's album format meant that, although the station served a gap in the market, its audience was smaller than in the 1960s. Caroline also promoted O'Rahilly's concept of ''Loving Awareness'' (LA), a far-eastern philosophy of love and peace. Some DJs were embarrassed but some were fascinated by the challenge of an abstract concept. Disc jockey [[Tony Allan]] developed a following, combining Loving Awareness with a professional style, humanity, knowledge of music and rich radio voice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1974, O'Rahilly set up a pop group called The Loving Awareness Band, comprising [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] (guitar) and [[Mick Gallagher]] (keyboards) both formerly of [[Skip Bifferty]] and two session musicians, [[Norman Watt-Roy]] (bass) and Charlie Charles (drums). In 1976, The Loving Awareness Band released their only album, ''Loving Awareness'' on More Love Records (ML001), a label set up by O'Rahilly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popgeekheaven.com/music-discovery/lost-treasures-loving-awareness|title=Lost Treasures \u2013 Loving Awareness|last=Marston|first=Peter|date=17 June 2014|website=Pop Geek Heaven|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref> The album was reissued on CD on Ross Records, c.1992, and in a \"30th Anniversary Edition\" with bonus material on SMC Records in 2005. The band broke up in 1977; Watt-Roy and Charles played on [[Ian Dury]]'s ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' album, and Turnbull and Gallagher joined them on the [[Stiff Records|Stiff]]'s tour, becoming [[The Blockheads]].<ref>{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p19030 | tab = biography | label = Biography of Loving Awareness | first = Bruce | last = Eder | accessdate = 18 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch legislation===\nThe Dutch government banned unlicensed offshore radio on 1 September 1974. Radio Caroline continued, moving its headquarters and servicing operation to Spain. On 30 August 1974 ''Mi Amigo'' moved from the Dutch coast to the [[Knock Deep Channel]], approximately {{Convert|12|mi|km|0}} from the British coast. After 31 August, shows for Radio Mi Amigo were delivered on [[compact cassette|cassettes]] rather than [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tapes]]. Beginning in 1975, the cassettes were transported from [[Platja d'Aro|Playa d'Aro]] on the Europa Bus service, which carried people from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Madrid]] at low prices. The tapes were picked up in Belgium at a bus stop, taken to a small sports plane and dropped in the sea close to the radio ship. The Mi Amigo \"Top 50\" tapes were flown over by helicopter to get them on board more quickly.\n\nOn 1 September, a small motor launch had difficulties in rough seas. Radio Caroline broadcast appeals for help, giving the ship's position as {{coord|51|41|N|1|35|E}}. A coastguard vessel escorted the launch back to shore, but the authorities were unhappy that Caroline listeners had jammed the emergency switchboards.\n\nThe ''Mi Amigo'' was tendered clandestinely from Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Tenders and boat owners were warned, and some were prosecuted for ferrying staff and provisions to the ship. Belgium had outlawed offshore radio in 1962 and prosecuted advertisers, cutting the station's revenue. Belgian courts sentenced Tack and some DJs to fines and jail ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', although the prison terms were later cancelled.\n\n===Wavelength changes===\nThe two stations experimented with different frequencies. After a short test on 773&nbsp;kHz in late 1975, in May 1976, Radio Caroline began a daytime service on 1562&nbsp;kHz (192 m) using a 10&nbsp;kW transmitter, while its overnight service continued to share the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter with Radio Mi Amigo's daytime programming on 1187&nbsp;kHz (253 metres, announced as 259).\n\nIn December 1976, Radio Mi Amigo moved to 1562&nbsp;kHz on the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter, leaving Caroline on 1187&nbsp;kHz 24 hours a day on the 10&nbsp;kW. Radio Caroline had greater night-time interference, and it was decided to move Caroline to a new frequency. On 3 March 1977, Caroline closed, announcing that it would return six days later on 319 metres. To allow Radio Mi Amigo to continue broadcasting by day, the engineering work for Caroline's move had to be carried out over six nights, after the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter was switched off.\n\nCaroline returned on 9 March 1977 on 953&nbsp;kHz, actually 315 metres but announced as 319. This gave reasonable reception by day but strong [[heterodyne]] interference at night because the transmitter crystal was off-channel. In July Caroline moved to the adjacent channel, 962&nbsp;kHz (312 metres but still called 319) and reception in the UK improved. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo had interference on 1562&nbsp;kHz and changed to 1412&nbsp;kHz (212 m).\n\nFinally, Radio Mi Amigo moved to 962&nbsp;kHz on 1 December. Due to generator trouble, the two services could no longer be broadcast simultaneously and Radio Caroline again broadcast at night with both stations using the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter and Radio Caroline began to receive more mail from the continent. At times, a 10&nbsp;kW transmitter was used to save fuel and relieve the generators. The 10&nbsp;kW transmitters could run on the Henschel generator beside the two main MAN units and also a Cummins unit on the aft deck behind the wheelhouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roundsandsounds.co.uk |title=This site is put together by Johnny Lewis, an engineer and presenter who worked on the station at the time |publisher=Roundsandsounds.co.uk |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1977, Radio Caroline began sponsored evangelical programmes, and music programmes began at 9{{nbsp}}p.m. On 20 October 1978, technical and financial problems put the ''Mi Amigo'' off the air. Unhappy at the loss of advertising, Radio Mi Amigo terminated its contract with Caroline in November 1978 and broadcast from its own ship, the [[MV Magdalena|MV ''Magdalena'']] later that year, but this was short-lived. Broadcasting was in Dutch and English by day and in English at night, although for the first few months broadcasting finished at 10{{nbsp}}p.m. On 19 January 1979, the ageing ship took in water and a lifeboat was called to rescue the crew members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/seventy.htm |title=The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame: the seventies |publisher=Offshoreradio.co.uk |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Radio Caroline returned to the air on 15 April 1979.

It began taking in water and the crew was rescued by lifeboat.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> The generator was left running but the pumps could not manage and the vessel sank 10 minutes later. Three British nationals, a Dutchman and their canary (named Wilson after the former Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]) were rescued. The last broadcast from the ''Mi Amigo'' was by Stevie Gordon and Tom Anderson:<ref>http://images.45cat.com/the-one-shots-caroline-jingles-jumbo.jpg</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|('''Gordon'''): Well, we're sorry to tell you that due to the severe weather conditions and the fact that we are shipping quite a lot of water, we are closing down, and the crew are at this stage leaving the ship. Obviously, we hope to be back with you as soon as possible, but just for the moment we would like to say goodbye. \n('''Anderson'''): It's not a very good occasion really, we have to hurry this because the lifeboat is standing by. We're not leaving and disappearing, we're going onto the lifeboat hoping that the pumps can take it; if they can, we'll be back, if not, well, we really don't like to say it. \n('''Gordon'''): I think we'll be back in one way or another. \n('''Anderson'''): Yeah.

It left Spain, with an incomplete studio, to avoid legal entanglements. Radio Caroline began to broadcast from the ship on 19 August 1983, with unwanted mechanical sounds on speech. The station was opened by DJ Tom Anderson, who had said \"goodbye\" from the sinking ''Mi Amigo'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/CAR/car04.shtml |title=The wet and wild history of Radio Caroline (4) |publisher=Icce.rug.nl |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ross Revenge'' was larger than ''Mi Amigo'' and with more elaborate transmitting equipment: in 1983, two 5&nbsp;kW RCA transmitters and a RCA 50&nbsp;kW unit. One 5&nbsp;kW transmitter was initially not serviceable. When Radio Monique hired the main transmitter, spare parts were taken from a fourth transmitter to convert the 5&nbsp;kW into a 10&nbsp;kW unit, the RCA 5 and 10&nbsp;kW transmitters having similar designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eylard.nl/OffShoreRadio/Caroline/index.htm |title=Photos of the transmitters can be found here |publisher=Eylard.nl |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> The remaining 5&nbsp;kW transmitter was later converted for short wave use.\n\nO'Rahilly wanted Radio Caroline to become an [[oldies]] station. He was opposed by some DJs and crew who had worked on the ''Mi Amigo'' and the album format stayed along with presenters such as [[Andy Archer (radio presenter)|Andy Archer]], [[Samantha Dubois]], [[Grant Benson]], Robin Ross and Simon Barrett. Officially, Radio Caroline was managed from offices in North America, with advertising from the US and Canada. In practice, day-to-day servicing was carried from France and the UK.\n\nFrom the anchorage in the Knock Deep the ''Mi Amigo'''s mast could be seen on the horizon. Four studios were on board, enabling other services. Radio Caroline tried several frequencies, among them 963, 576, 585 (briefly), 558 (after [[Laser 558]] closed) and later 819&nbsp;kHz. European medium wave channels had been reallocated to multiples of nine. In the evenings on 963, some alternative music programmes were tried, including the [[reggae]] \"Jamming 963\", and in 1986 and early 1987, a progressive and indie rock programme called [[Caroline Overdrive]] hosted by Tom Anderson, Fergie McNeal, Andy Johnson, Stevie Lane, Mark Matthews, Kevin Turner, Peter Phillips, Mick Williams (a.k.a. Ray Clark) and Rob Charles.\n\nOn 9 August 1985, an official vessel anchored 150 yards from the ''Ross Revenge''. The UK [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) put a permanent watch on movements around the ''Ross Revenge'' and the MV ''Communicator'', Laser 558{{'}}s ship. On 3 September 1985 at 00:00 hours the ''[[Dioptric Surveyor]]'' departed in a storm.\n\n===Radio Monique===\n{{main|Radio Monique}}\nFrom December 1984 the ''Ross Revenge'' broadcast ''Radio Monique'', recorded and live Dutch-language programmes of a Dutch music radio production company using the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter during daytime. They were pop and Europop aimed at the mainstream Dutch audience. Radio Monique was popular throughout [[Benelux]].\n\nIn the evenings, Radio Caroline transmitted Dutch and American religious [[Evangelism|evangelist]] broadcasters such as [[Johan Maasbach]] and [[Roy Masters (commentator)|Roy Masters]] on medium wave, and later on short wave, under the name ''Viewpoint 963/819'', or ''World Mission Radio (WMR)'' on short wave.\n\nIn November 1985, the competing offshore station, Laser 558, closed after electrical problems and Caroline moved from 576&nbsp;kHz to Laser's 558&nbsp;kHz frequency, with a [[Top 40]] music format similar to Laser's under the name Caroline 558. When Laser returned as Laser Hot Hits, it used Caroline's former and inferior frequency of 576&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Mast collapse===\nIn 1987, the [[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1980-1999|Territorial Sea Act]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=37&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1323295&activetextdocid=1323297 |title=Territorial Sea Act 1987 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> extended the UK maritime limit from three to 12 nautical miles (22&nbsp;km). To remain in international waters, the ship moved to a new, less-sheltered anchorage. Initially this was a minor inconvenience as the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} mast was thought sturdy enough. However, in [[Great Storm of 1987|October 1987 a massive storm]] hit southern England, causing deaths and severe damage. MV ''Ross Revenge'' weathered the storm in the North Sea.\n\nThe following day, Caroline was one of few stations in the South East still broadcasting. However, the storm had weakened the mast, which collapsed in another storm later. Caroline returned to the air using a makeshift aerial with a less powerful signal. This was replaced by a twin-mast T-antenna. For several months only one transmitter could be used, leading to the loss of the income-generating Radio Monique, although a substitute Dutch daytime service, Radio 558 (later Radio 819), was eventually established.\n\n===1989 Anglo-Dutch raid===\nDuring mid-August 1989, authorities in several European countries carried out co-ordinated raids on houses, recording studios and offices believed to be used by Caroline. On 18 August, a British government chartered ship pulled up alongside the ''Ross Revenge'' and asked to board to \"discuss the future\" of the ''Ross Revenge'' and the stations operating from it. This request, and one to stop transmissions on 819&nbsp;kHz, was refused. A request to stop broadcasting on short wave 6.215&nbsp;MHz was complied with, and after several hours the government ship returned to port.\n\nThe following day James Murphy, an investigator for the UK Office of the [[Official Solicitor]], acting for the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], joined colleagues and counterparts from the [[Netherlands Radio Regulatory Authority]] to execute an armed raid on the ''Ross Revenge'' in which equipment was damaged or confiscated.\n\nPart of the raid was broadcast live<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://dxradio.co.uk/audio/Caroline_558_19aug1989.mp3|title = Dxradio|website = }}</ref> before officials disabled the transmitters. Dutch nationals were arrested and returned to the Netherlands, together with most of the broadcasting equipment. Non-Dutch staff were given the option of staying on the ship or returning to the Netherlands \u2013 most chose to stay on board. Caroline claimed boarding the ship and removal or destruction of equipment was [[piracy]]. The Dutch claimed the ship's Panamanian registration had lapsed in 1987 and it was not under legal protection from any country and that its transmissions breached international regulations which since 1982 had prohibited broadcasting from outside national territories. Several years later some of the seized items were returned to the station.\n\nIn 1990 the UK government amended the 1967 anti-offshore law to allow the boarding and silencing of stations in international waters if their signals could be received in the UK, even if their vessels were foreign-registered and operated. [[Noel Annan, Baron Annan|Lord Annan]], author of the 1977 [[Annan Committee|Report of the Committee on the Future of Broadcasting]], spoke in defence of Radio Caroline in the House of Lords at report stage on the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], saying \"Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1990/jun/05/broadcasting-bill#column_1257 |title=Hansard 5 June 1990 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> In a 1995 article for the pressure group [[Charter88]], Steve McGann commented: <blockquote> \"Whether Caroline was right to maintain her defiance for so many years is irrelevant. Her story illustrates how uniquely dangerous government regards an independent voice transmitted over unrestricted airwaves and to what ends it will go to silence it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/other/mcgann.html |title=The Real story of Radio Caroline |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=3 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163420/http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/other/mcgann.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref> </blockquote> This legislation remains in force.\n\n===1990\u20131991: After the raid===\nOn 1 October 1989, Radio Caroline restarted broadcasting from the ''Ross Revenge'' using makeshift equipment and low power, to retain the 558&nbsp;kHz frequency. Engineer Peter Chicago had hidden transmitter parts during the raid and retuned one 5&nbsp;kW transmitter, previously used on short-wave, to 558&nbsp;kHz. Over the following months, Caroline's signal quality improved as transmitting [[Vacuum tube|valves]] were donated and programming returned to normal.\n\nIn June 1990, [[Spectrum Radio]], a new multi-ethnic [[community radio]] station in London, was officially allocated 558&nbsp;kHz. Caroline caused more interference to Spectrum than vice versa. Caroline broadcast regular apologies to Spectrum listeners but refused to vacate the channel. Spectrum threatened to sue the [[Radio Authority]], which then allowed Spectrum to temporarily broadcast on 990&nbsp;kHz alongside 558&nbsp;kHz. Eventually, Caroline left 558&nbsp;kHz and moved to 819&nbsp;kHz. On 5 November 1990, lack of fuel and supplies forced the station to stop transmitting. The final song was ''[[Pilot of the Airwaves]]'' by [[Charlie Dore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/1st%20&%20Last%20A-L.htm |title=First & last |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |accessdate=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206115136/http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/1st%20%26%20Last%20A-L.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough most broadcasting staff left at that time, some remained for a year as caretakers while funding and equipment were sought.  The station tried to obtain a licence from a developing country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasradiogroup.org/caroline-movement |title=Caroline Movement |publisher=sasradiogroup |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> hoping it might offer protection from the new provisions in the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] which came into force on 31 December that year.\n\nIn November 1991, the ship lost its anchor in a storm and drifted on to the [[Goodwin Sands]] in the Channel. The crew was rescued by a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] helicopter. The ''Ross Revenge'' was salvaged and brought into harbour in Dover, ending 27 years of Radio Caroline's unlicensed offshore career.\n\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name             = Radio Caroline\n| area             = UK<br />Worldwide (Internet);<br />Europe (up to September 2013) ([[Eutelsat 28A]])\n| airdate          = 1999\n| frequency        = Various Internet streams<ref name=\"Radio Caroline Streams Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://carolinestreams.weebly.com/|title=Radio Caroline Streams Guide|publisher=Carolinestreams.weekly.com|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><br />[[UPC Ireland]]: Channel 927<br />[[Smallworld Cable]]: Channel 855<br /><br />[[Eutelsat 28A]] (to 30 September 2013):<br />Freq. 11.426 GHz <br />Polarisation: Horizontal<br />Symbol Rate: 27.5<br />FEC: 2/3\n| format           = AOR (Album/adult oriented)\n| owner            = Radio Caroline Ltd. and Caroline Support Group (originally called the Ross Revenge Support Group).\n| website          = [http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk]\n}}\n\n==Since 1991: Licensed Support Group era==\nSince 1991, the ''Ross Revenge'' has been maintained by enthusiasts called the ''Radio Caroline Support Group'', originally the ''Ross Revenge Support Group''.

Some of these 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence]] (RSL) broadcasts took place from the ''Ross Revenge'' during the 1990s, with the ship anchored off Clacton, in London's [[Canary Wharf]], [[Southend Pier]] and off the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in [[Kent]].\n\nAt one minute past midnight on 1 October 2001, Caroline returned on 1503&nbsp;kHz from the LV (Light Vessel) 18 in Harwich harbour. This two-day broadcast featured Phil Mitchell, Paul Dennis, Colin Lamb, John Patrick, Barry James, Steve Cisco and Clive Boutell.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. Martin van der Ven |url=http://www.radiocaroline.de/platt2.htm |title=Radio Caroline: Into the new millennium |publisher=Radiocaroline.de |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> The LV 18 was later used by the BBC for BBC Pirate Radio Essex broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/pirate/exhibition.shtml |title=Pirate BBC Essex |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother RSL broadcast ran from 7 August until 3 September 2004, with the ship moored at the cruise liner terminal jetty at Tilbury in Essex. It commemorated the 40th anniversary of Radio Caroline and promoted the station's legal internet and satellite programmes. The medium wave frequency was 235 metres (1278&nbsp;kHz) and programmes were sent through [[ISDN]] landline to [[Maidstone]] and via the internet and broadcast on satellite. The supermarket chain [[Asda]] and [[English Heritage]] were among the backers.\n\nThe station has subsequently broadcast on 531&nbsp;kHz AM from the ''Ross Revenge'' during some [[bank holiday]] weekends, beginning on 28\u201331 August 2009 and also within a few days of the 50th anniversary of the ship's first voyage.\n\n===Satellite and Internet broadcasting===\nUsing land-based studios leased in Kent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maidstonestudios.com/ |title=Home &#124; The Maistone Television Studios |publisher=Maidstonestudios.com |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> in the late 1990s, the station began broadcasting via satellites [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E]] and [[Eutelsat 28A]], covering [[western Europe]].

On Saturday, 28 March, it began regular broadcasting at noon on 197.3 metres/1520&nbsp;kHz (announced as 199 metres) with the opening conducted by [[Simon Dee]].<ref>name=\"Henry/von Joel\"</ref> The first programme, which was pre-recorded, was hosted by [[Christopher Moore (DJ)|Chris Moore]].  Radio Caroline's first musical theme was [[Jimmy McGriff]]'s \"Round Midnight\", a [[jazz standard]] co-composed by [[Thelonious Monk]]. In March 1964, [[The Fortunes]] recorded ''Caroline'', which became the station's theme. ''Round Midnight'' was confined to closedown on Radio Caroline North after [[The World Tomorrow (radio and television)|''The World Tomorrow'']]. The station's slogan was ''Your all-day music station'', and it initially broadcast from 6{{nbsp}}a.m. to 6{{nbsp}}p.m., seven days a week.\n\nRadio Caroline announced a wavelength of 199 metres (UK stations stated their wavelength, rather than frequency), rhyming with the name, but was actually broadcasting on 197.3 metres (1520&nbsp;kHz). Radios at that time were tuned using an analogue dial, which allowed for some leeway between the precise transmission frequency and that announced on the air. The Dutch offshore station [[Radio Veronica]] was on 192 metres (1562&nbsp;kHz) and [[Radio Atlanta]] broadcast on 201 (1493&nbsp;kHz).\n\nRadio Caroline's transmission output was almost 20&nbsp;[[kW]], achieved by linking two 10&nbsp;kW [[Continental Electronics]] transmitters. Broadcasting hours were 6{{nbsp}}a.m. to 6{{nbsp}}p.m. to avoid competition from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], which began transmissions at  6{{nbsp}}p.m. The station returned at 8{{nbsp}}p.m. and continued until after midnight to avoid competition with popular television programmes. Most of Radio Caroline's [[pop music]] programmes were targeted at housewives, and some later programming was aimed at children. Without serious competition, Radio Caroline gained a regular daytime audience of some 7 million.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clark|first=Ray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DoTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT123&dq=Radio+Caroline++audience+10+million.&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwil9dizorHoAhWChHIEHQQMDA8Q6AEwAnoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=%2010%20million.&f=false|title=Radio Caroline: The True Story of the Boat that Rocked|date=2014-02-03|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7509-5473-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Merger with Radio Atlanta===\n[[File:ERosko.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Emperor Rosko|Emperor Rosko]]\nOn 2 July 1964, Radio Atlanta and Radio Caroline's companies, ''Project Atlanta'' and ''Planet Productions.'', announced the stations were to merge, with Crawford and O'Rahilly as joint managing directors. Radio Atlanta closed at 8{{nbsp}}p.m. that day. It was renamed '''Radio Caroline South''' and MV ''Mi Amigo'' remained off [[Frinton-on-Sea]] while MV ''Caroline'' broadcast as '''Radio Caroline North'''. MV ''Caroline'' sailed from [[Felixstowe]] to the [[Isle of Man]], broadcasting as she went. The only broadcast staff on board were [[Tom Lodge]] and [[Jerry Leighton]]. MV ''Caroline'' arrived at her new anchorage on the southern tip of the [[Bahama Bank]], Ramsey Bay, on 6 July 1964,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cameraimages.co.uk/page22.html|title=RADIO AT SEA 1|website=www.cameraimages.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref> at a position formerly occupied by the [[Bahama Bank Lightship]]. The two stations were able to cover most of the British Isles. Later, some programmes were pre-recorded on land and broadcast simultaneously from both ships.\n\nIn October 1965, O'Rahilly bought Crawford's interest in the MV ''Mi Amigo'' and engaged [[Tom Lodge]] from Radio Caroline North to make programme changes and regain the audience from [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. Lodge hired new DJs and introduced free-form programming which, by August 1966, had succeeded, creating an audience of 23 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nWhen the US-backed Radio London arrived off the coast of England, there was an unsuccessful attempt to merge its sales operation with that of Caroline before Radio London started transmissions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

DJ [[Jack Spector]], of the [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] \"Good Guys\" in New York, regularly recorded for Radio Caroline. Syndicated shows from the US and recorded religious programmes were also broadcast. [[BBC Radio 2]] newsreader [[Colin Berry]] and [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]'s Nick Bailey started their careers reading the news on Radio Caroline South.\n\n[[File:Tom Lodge 1966 - 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Lodge]] was a radio disc jockey for Radio Caroline from 1964 until his death in 2012]]\nIn mid-September 1965, the crew and DJs on MV ''Mi Amigo'' were joined for the weekend by 1960s pop singer [[Sylvan Whittingham]], who visited the ship to promote her single \"We Don't Belong\". Whittingham was unable to leave on the tender when a storm arose. The only singer to stay overnight, she helped present programmes, make jingles, and close the station at night.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/odds52.htm\n|title = The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame: Sylvan the Stowaway\n|publisher = Offshoreradio.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===''Mi Amigo'' runs aground===\nOn 20 January 1966, the MV ''Mi Amigo'' lost its anchor in a storm, drifted and ran aground on the beach at Frinton-on-Sea. The crew and broadcasting staff were rescued unharmed, but the ship's hull was damaged and repairs were carried out at [[Zaandam]], Netherlands. Between 31 January and 1 May, Radio Caroline South broadcast from the vessel ''Cheeta II'', owned by [[Britt Wadner]] of Swedish offshore station [[Radio Syd]], which was off the air because of pack ice in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> The ''Cheeta II'' was equipped for FM broadcasting, so it was fitted with the 10&nbsp;kW transmitter from the ''Mi Amigo'', feeding a makeshift antenna. The resulting signal was low-powered, but ensured that Caroline South's advertising revenue would continue.\n\nThe ''Mi Amigo'' returned to its Frinton-on-Sea anchorage with a redesigned antenna and a new 50&nbsp;kW transmitter and attempted to resume broadcasting on 18 April, nominally on 259 metres to enable the same jingles as Radio Caroline North on 1169&nbsp;kHz to be used, but actually 252 metres. The transmitter was initially too powerful for the antenna insulators. On 27 April, the ''Mi Amigo'' was fully operational.\n\nRadio Caroline South's 259 metres signal was now near those of Radio London on 266m (1133&nbsp;kHz) and the [[BBC Light Programme|BBC's Light Programme]] on 247m (1214&nbsp;kHz). Radio Caroline North subsequently moved to 257m (1169&nbsp;kHz) but also called it 259.\n\n===Radio City affair===\nIn October 1965, negotiations began for Radio Caroline to take over [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]], which broadcast from [[Shivering Sands Army Fort]], a Second World War [[Maunsell Sea Forts|marine fort]] off the [[Kent]]<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> coast. One of Radio Caroline's directors, Major [[Oliver Smedley]], formerly of Radio Atlanta, entered a partnership with Radio City's owner, pop group manager [[Reginald Calvert]] and installed a more powerful transmitter on the fort. However, according to Gerry Bishop's book ''Offshore Radio'' this transmitter was antiquated and failed to work. Smedley later withdrew from the deal.<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article7053070.ece\n|title = Dorothy Calvert: Rock\u2019n\u2019roll entrepreneur and pirate radio pioneer\n|date = 8 March 2010\n|publisher = Times Newspapers Ltd\n|accessdate = 17 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 June 1966, Smedley boarded the Shivering Sands Fort with 10 workmen to repossess a transmitter that he had supplied, but had not been paid for. The next day, Calvert visited Smedley's home in Saffron Walden, Essex, to demand the departure of the raiders and the return of vital transmitter parts. During a violent struggle, Calvert was shot dead. Smedley's men occupied the fort until 22 June.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\nSmedley was charged with Calvert's murder on 18 July, but this was reduced to a charge of manslaughter.

In an earlier House of Commons debate (in June 1966), the government had claimed that the pirate ships were a danger because of radio frequency interference to emergency shipping channels, and to overseas radio stations and the pirates were paying no royalties to artists, composers or record companies. Furthermore, it was stated that the pirates' use of wavelengths also broke international agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jun/22/wireless-and-television-pirate-stations |title=WIRELESS AND TELEVISION (PIRATE STATIONS) (Hansard, 22 June 1966) |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=22 June 1966 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> The Manx parliament, the [[Tynwald]], attempted to exclude the North ship from the legislation, appealing to the European Court on the legality of the act being applied to the [[Isle of Man]]. Two ([[Radio 270]] and Radio London) of the remaining four UK-based offshore stations closed, but the two Caroline ships continued with their supply operation moved to Netherlands waters, where unlicensed ship-based broadcasting was not outlawed until 1974.\n\nWhen Marine &c. Broadcasting Offences Act become law on 14 August 1967, Radio Caroline was renamed Radio Caroline International. Six weeks later, the [[BBC]] introduced its new national pop station [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], modelled largely on the successful offshore station Radio London, and employed many of the ex-pirate DJs. The [[BBC Light Programme|BBC Light]], [[BBC Third Programme|Third]], and [[BBC Home Service|Home]] programmes became [[BBC Radio 2|Radios 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|4]] respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&page=1 | work = Daily Telegraph | title = The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1| date = 27 September 2007 | author = Imogen Carter | accessdate = 30 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1968, the radio ships ''Mi Amigo'' and ''Caroline'', were boarded and seized before the day's broadcasting began. They were towed to Amsterdam by a salvage company to secure unpaid bills for servicing by the Dutch tender company [[Wijsmuller Transport]]<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\nBecause of the rise of land-based pirate stations after the MOA became law (usually stations run from bedrooms or outdoor sheds with small wattage transmitters), at least two stations broadcast using the Caroline name, one based in Dublin. These broadcasts took place between 1970 and 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dxarchive.com/ireland_a_to_z_irish_pirates_radio_caroline_dublin_1970.html|title=RADIO CAROLINE DUBLIN|website=dxarchive.com|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==1970: Radio North Sea International==\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name             = Radio Caroline International\n| area             = Broadcasting from various locations offshore to Western Europe\n| airdate          = Sat 13 June \u2013 Fri 19 June 1970\n| frequency        = 244m MW, 100.0 MHz FM, 6205 kHz SW\n| format           = popular music and news\n| power            = 105 kW MW\n| erp              = 90 kW MW\n| owner            = Mebo Ltd\n| affiliations     = A brief name change from Radio North Sea International during the UK General Election campaign, after which the station reverted to its original name.\n}}\n\nOn 24 March 1970, a radio ship named {{MV|Mebo II||2}} anchored off the east coast of England during the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]] campaign, broadcasting as [[Radio North Sea International]] (RNI). RNI operated on medium wave, short wave and FM. Its medium wave transmission was [[Radio jamming|jammed]] by the UK authorities and on 13 June, RNI changed its name to Radio Caroline International with co-operation from Ronan O'Rahilly. Radio Caroline lobbied against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and for the introduction of licensed commercial radio in the United Kingdom. Following the election, RNI resumed its original name but jamming continued under the newly-elected Conservative government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_4.html|title=Caroline continues alone, is overwhelmed by difficulties but returns to punish the politicians|publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> It was not until RNI returned to its original anchorage off the Netherlands that the jamming ceased.\n\n==Caroline Television==\nNews stories appeared in Europe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/ctv.htm |title=Caroline TV \u2013 the press cuttings |publisher=Offshoreradio.co.uk |date=30 June 1970 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> announcing the start of Caroline Television<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherishedtelevision.co.uk/caroline.html |title=Caroline Television |publisher=Cherishedtelevision.co.uk |date=16 February 1970 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> from two [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]] aircraft using [[Stratovision]] technology.

That autumn various tests, consisting of continuous music, were made on 259 metres. The station restarted just before Christmas as Radio 199 but soon became Radio Caroline, with a Top 40 format. DJs Chris Cary, broadcasting as [[Spangles Muldoon]] (who was also station manager), [[Roger Day|Roger 'Twiggy' Day]], Andy Archer, [[Paul Rusling|Paul Alexander]], [[Steve England]], Johnny Jason and Peter Chicago (real name Peter Murtha)<ref name=\"Noakes\" /> manned the station.\n\nIn late 1972, Radio Caroline had money problems. On 28 December, unpaid crew cut the ''Mi Amigo'''s generator fuel line and departed. Later that day, the Dutch Royal Navy returned the crew and fighting broke out on board. Two days later, ''Mi Amigo'' was towed to [[IJmuiden]] and seized because of unpaid bills.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> Because of the Christmas holidays, no solicitors were available to issue a writ and the ship lay in Amsterdam harbour until O'Rahilly arranged for it to be towed back to sea. The ship was further delayed by hull damage, and repaired before writs could be issued.<ref name=\"Noakes\" />\n\nBetween 11 and 20 April 1973, the ship broadcast for Radio Veronica while its ship, the ''[[MV Norderney|Norderney]]'', was aground. Because of a law that allows pirates in distress to come ashore without arrest, the running aground had no consequences for the crew.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> During summer 1973, it broadcast separate stations in English and Dutch simultaneously, on 389 m / 773&nbsp;kHz and 252 m (announced as 259) / 1187&nbsp;kHz. Two aerials and twin transmitters were used for about six weeks until the aerial mast failed. To accommodate the second aerial, a second short mast, just in front of the bridge, was employed as the other end of the aerial fixed to the main mast.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Radio Atlantis and Radio Seagull===\n{{main|Radio Atlantis}}\nAround this time, O'Rahilly decided Caroline should adopt an album format similar to [[progressive rock (radio format)|FM progressive rock]] stations in the US, an audience not catered for in Europe. This service was Radio Seagull and broadcast live during the evening.\n\nSince Radio Caroline could not find enough advertising, it shared its nominal 259-metre wavelength (actually 1187&nbsp;kHz or 253 metres) with Dutch-language pop stations. The first was a Belgian station called [[Radio Atlantis]], owned by Belgian businessman Adriaan van Landschoot. Programmes were recorded on land and broadcast between 6{{nbsp}}a.m. and 7{{nbsp}}p.m. Rough weather sometimes prevented tapes from arriving and old programmes had to be repeated. Later in 1973, when the contract with Radio Caroline ended, the crew of Radio Atlantis moved to their own ship, the {{MV|Jeanine}}.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" />\n\nRadio Seagull became Radio Caroline on 23 February 1974, retaining the album format. Throughout most of the 1970s, Radio Caroline could be heard only at night, calling itself \"Europe's first and only album station\".\n\n===Radio Mi Amigo===\nAnother Belgian station, '''Radio Mi Amigo International''', launched on 1 January 1974; it was run by Belgian businessman and [[Waffle|Suzy Waffles]] owner [[Sylvain Tack]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/Sylvain%20Tack.htm |title=Tribute to Sylvain Tack |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> The station's offices and studios were in [[Brakel]], Belgium, but moved to [[Castell-Platja d'Aro]], Costa Brava, Spain in March 1975 after a raid by Belgian police. Here they produced programmes for Dutch-speaking holidaymakers, mostly [[Europop]], [[Top 40]], [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] and Dutch language popular music presented by Belgian, Dutch and occasionally English DJs with frequent commercials. Because commercial radio was prohibited in Belgium, Radio Mi Amigo had little competition from the former BRT State Radio and TV (today VRT Flemisch State radio and TV) and became very popular in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. For the first years, advertising on the station was in demand. When [[Radio Veronica]] closed in 1974, some presenters moved to Radio Mi Amigo.\n\n===Loving Awareness===\nCaroline's album format meant that, although the station served a gap in the market, its audience was smaller than in the 1960s. Caroline also promoted O'Rahilly's concept of ''Loving Awareness'' (LA), a far-eastern philosophy of love and peace. Some DJs were embarrassed but some were fascinated by the challenge of an abstract concept. Disc jockey [[Tony Allan]] developed a following, combining Loving Awareness with a professional style, humanity, knowledge of music and rich radio voice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1974, O'Rahilly set up a pop group called The Loving Awareness Band, comprising [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] (guitar) and [[Mick Gallagher]] (keyboards) both formerly of [[Skip Bifferty]] and two session musicians, [[Norman Watt-Roy]] (bass) and Charlie Charles (drums). In 1976, The Loving Awareness Band released their only album, ''Loving Awareness'' on More Love Records (ML001), a label set up by O'Rahilly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popgeekheaven.com/music-discovery/lost-treasures-loving-awareness|title=Lost Treasures \u2013 Loving Awareness|last=Marston|first=Peter|date=17 June 2014|website=Pop Geek Heaven|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref> The album was reissued on CD on Ross Records, c.1992, and in a \"30th Anniversary Edition\" with bonus material on SMC Records in 2005. The band broke up in 1977; Watt-Roy and Charles played on [[Ian Dury]]'s ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' album, and Turnbull and Gallagher joined them on the [[Stiff Records|Stiff]]'s tour, becoming [[The Blockheads]].<ref>{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p19030 | tab = biography | label = Biography of Loving Awareness | first = Bruce | last = Eder | accessdate = 18 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch legislation===\nThe Dutch government banned unlicensed offshore radio on 1 September 1974. Radio Caroline continued, moving its headquarters and servicing operation to Spain. On 30 August 1974 ''Mi Amigo'' moved from the Dutch coast to the [[Knock Deep Channel]], approximately {{Convert|12|mi|km|0}} from the British coast. After 31 August, shows for Radio Mi Amigo were delivered on [[compact cassette|cassettes]] rather than [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tapes]]. Beginning in 1975, the cassettes were transported from [[Platja d'Aro|Playa d'Aro]] on the Europa Bus service, which carried people from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Madrid]] at low prices. The tapes were picked up in Belgium at a bus stop, taken to a small sports plane and dropped in the sea close to the radio ship. The Mi Amigo \"Top 50\" tapes were flown over by helicopter to get them on board more quickly.\n\nOn 1 September, a small motor launch had difficulties in rough seas. Radio Caroline broadcast appeals for help, giving the ship's position as {{coord|51|41|N|1|35|E}}. A coastguard vessel escorted the launch back to shore, but the authorities were unhappy that Caroline listeners had jammed the emergency switchboards.\n\nThe ''Mi Amigo'' was tendered clandestinely from Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Tenders and boat owners were warned, and some were prosecuted for ferrying staff and provisions to the ship. Belgium had outlawed offshore radio in 1962 and prosecuted advertisers, cutting the station's revenue. Belgian courts sentenced Tack and some DJs to fines and jail ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', although the prison terms were later cancelled.\n\n===Wavelength changes===\nThe two stations experimented with different frequencies. After a short test on 773&nbsp;kHz in late 1975, in May 1976, Radio Caroline began a daytime service on 1562&nbsp;kHz (192 m) using a 10&nbsp;kW transmitter, while its overnight service continued to share the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter with Radio Mi Amigo's daytime programming on 1187&nbsp;kHz (253 metres, announced as 259).\n\nIn December 1976, Radio Mi Amigo moved to 1562&nbsp;kHz on the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter, leaving Caroline on 1187&nbsp;kHz 24 hours a day on the 10&nbsp;kW. Radio Caroline had greater night-time interference, and it was decided to move Caroline to a new frequency. On 3 March 1977, Caroline closed, announcing that it would return six days later on 319 metres. To allow Radio Mi Amigo to continue broadcasting by day, the engineering work for Caroline's move had to be carried out over six nights, after the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter was switched off.\n\nCaroline returned on 9 March 1977 on 953&nbsp;kHz, actually 315 metres but announced as 319. This gave reasonable reception by day but strong [[heterodyne]] interference at night because the transmitter crystal was off-channel. In July Caroline moved to the adjacent channel, 962&nbsp;kHz (312 metres but still called 319) and reception in the UK improved. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo had interference on 1562&nbsp;kHz and changed to 1412&nbsp;kHz (212 m).\n\nFinally, Radio Mi Amigo moved to 962&nbsp;kHz on 1 December. Due to generator trouble, the two services could no longer be broadcast simultaneously and Radio Caroline again broadcast at night with both stations using the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter and Radio Caroline began to receive more mail from the continent. At times, a 10&nbsp;kW transmitter was used to save fuel and relieve the generators. The 10&nbsp;kW transmitters could run on the Henschel generator beside the two main MAN units and also a Cummins unit on the aft deck behind the wheelhouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roundsandsounds.co.uk |title=This site is put together by Johnny Lewis, an engineer and presenter who worked on the station at the time |publisher=Roundsandsounds.co.uk |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1977, Radio Caroline began sponsored evangelical programmes, and music programmes began at 9{{nbsp}}p.m. On 20 October 1978, technical and financial problems put the ''Mi Amigo'' off the air. Unhappy at the loss of advertising, Radio Mi Amigo terminated its contract with Caroline in November 1978 and broadcast from its own ship, the [[MV Magdalena|MV ''Magdalena'']] later that year, but this was short-lived. Broadcasting was in Dutch and English by day and in English at night, although for the first few months broadcasting finished at 10{{nbsp}}p.m. On 19 January 1979, the ageing ship took in water and a lifeboat was called to rescue the crew members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/seventy.htm |title=The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame: the seventies |publisher=Offshoreradio.co.uk |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Radio Caroline returned to the air on 15 April 1979.

It began taking in water and the crew was rescued by lifeboat.<ref name=\"Henry/von Joel\" /> The generator was left running but the pumps could not manage and the vessel sank 10 minutes later. Three British nationals, a Dutchman and their canary (named Wilson after the former Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]) were rescued. The last broadcast from the ''Mi Amigo'' was by Stevie Gordon and Tom Anderson:<ref>http://images.45cat.com/the-one-shots-caroline-jingles-jumbo.jpg</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|('''Gordon'''): Well, we're sorry to tell you that due to the severe weather conditions and the fact that we are shipping quite a lot of water, we are closing down, and the crew are at this stage leaving the ship.

We're not leaving and disappearing, we're going onto the lifeboat hoping that the pumps can take it; if they can, we'll be back, if not, well, we really don't like to say it. \n('''Gordon'''): I think we'll be back in one way or another. \n('''Anderson'''): Yeah. I think so. \n('''Gordon'''): For the moment from all of us, goodbye and God bless.}}\n\nThe crew of the [[Sheerness]] lifeboat ''Helen Turnbull'' were commended for the rescue of broadcasters Tom Anderson, Stevie Gordon, Nick Richards and Hans Verlaan from ''Mi Amigo'' while it was sinking in the Black Deep near Long Sand Bank. Having to manoeuvre the lifeboat alongside the stricken vessel 13 times in high seas and a north-easterly gale earned Coxswain Charles Bowry an [[RNLI]] silver medal.

It left Spain, with an incomplete studio, to avoid legal entanglements. Radio Caroline began to broadcast from the ship on 19 August 1983, with unwanted mechanical sounds on speech. The station was opened by DJ Tom Anderson, who had said \"goodbye\" from the sinking ''Mi Amigo'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/CAR/car04.shtml |title=The wet and wild history of Radio Caroline (4) |publisher=Icce.rug.nl |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ross Revenge'' was larger than ''Mi Amigo'' and with more elaborate transmitting equipment: in 1983, two 5&nbsp;kW RCA transmitters and a RCA 50&nbsp;kW unit. One 5&nbsp;kW transmitter was initially not serviceable. When Radio Monique hired the main transmitter, spare parts were taken from a fourth transmitter to convert the 5&nbsp;kW into a 10&nbsp;kW unit, the RCA 5 and 10&nbsp;kW transmitters having similar designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eylard.nl/OffShoreRadio/Caroline/index.htm |title=Photos of the transmitters can be found here |publisher=Eylard.nl |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> The remaining 5&nbsp;kW transmitter was later converted for short wave use.\n\nO'Rahilly wanted Radio Caroline to become an [[oldies]] station. He was opposed by some DJs and crew who had worked on the ''Mi Amigo'' and the album format stayed along with presenters such as [[Andy Archer (radio presenter)|Andy Archer]], [[Samantha Dubois]], [[Grant Benson]], Robin Ross and Simon Barrett. Officially, Radio Caroline was managed from offices in North America, with advertising from the US and Canada. In practice, day-to-day servicing was carried from France and the UK.\n\nFrom the anchorage in the Knock Deep the ''Mi Amigo'''s mast could be seen on the horizon. Four studios were on board, enabling other services. Radio Caroline tried several frequencies, among them 963, 576, 585 (briefly), 558 (after [[Laser 558]] closed) and later 819&nbsp;kHz. European medium wave channels had been reallocated to multiples of nine. In the evenings on 963, some alternative music programmes were tried, including the [[reggae]] \"Jamming 963\", and in 1986 and early 1987, a progressive and indie rock programme called [[Caroline Overdrive]] hosted by Tom Anderson, Fergie McNeal, Andy Johnson, Stevie Lane, Mark Matthews, Kevin Turner, Peter Phillips, Mick Williams (a.k.a. Ray Clark) and Rob Charles.\n\nOn 9 August 1985, an official vessel anchored 150 yards from the ''Ross Revenge''. The UK [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) put a permanent watch on movements around the ''Ross Revenge'' and the MV ''Communicator'', Laser 558{{'}}s ship. On 3 September 1985 at 00:00 hours the ''[[Dioptric Surveyor]]'' departed in a storm.\n\n===Radio Monique===\n{{main|Radio Monique}}\nFrom December 1984 the ''Ross Revenge'' broadcast ''Radio Monique'', recorded and live Dutch-language programmes of a Dutch music radio production company using the 50&nbsp;kW transmitter during daytime. They were pop and Europop aimed at the mainstream Dutch audience. Radio Monique was popular throughout [[Benelux]].\n\nIn the evenings, Radio Caroline transmitted Dutch and American religious [[Evangelism|evangelist]] broadcasters such as [[Johan Maasbach]] and [[Roy Masters (commentator)|Roy Masters]] on medium wave, and later on short wave, under the name ''Viewpoint 963/819'', or ''World Mission Radio (WMR)'' on short wave.\n\nIn November 1985, the competing offshore station, Laser 558, closed after electrical problems and Caroline moved from 576&nbsp;kHz to Laser's 558&nbsp;kHz frequency, with a [[Top 40]] music format similar to Laser's under the name Caroline 558. When Laser returned as Laser Hot Hits, it used Caroline's former and inferior frequency of 576&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Mast collapse===\nIn 1987, the [[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1980-1999|Territorial Sea Act]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=37&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1323295&activetextdocid=1323297 |title=Territorial Sea Act 1987 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> extended the UK maritime limit from three to 12 nautical miles (22&nbsp;km). To remain in international waters, the ship moved to a new, less-sheltered anchorage. Initially this was a minor inconvenience as the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} mast was thought sturdy enough. However, in [[Great Storm of 1987|October 1987 a massive storm]] hit southern England, causing deaths and severe damage. MV ''Ross Revenge'' weathered the storm in the North Sea.\n\nThe following day, Caroline was one of few stations in the South East still broadcasting. However, the storm had weakened the mast, which collapsed in another storm later. Caroline returned to the air using a makeshift aerial with a less powerful signal. This was replaced by a twin-mast T-antenna. For several months only one transmitter could be used, leading to the loss of the income-generating Radio Monique, although a substitute Dutch daytime service, Radio 558 (later Radio 819), was eventually established.\n\n===1989 Anglo-Dutch raid===\nDuring mid-August 1989, authorities in several European countries carried out co-ordinated raids on houses, recording studios and offices believed to be used by Caroline. On 18 August, a British government chartered ship pulled up alongside the ''Ross Revenge'' and asked to board to \"discuss the future\" of the ''Ross Revenge'' and the stations operating from it. This request, and one to stop transmissions on 819&nbsp;kHz, was refused. A request to stop broadcasting on short wave 6.215&nbsp;MHz was complied with, and after several hours the government ship returned to port.\n\nThe following day James Murphy, an investigator for the UK Office of the [[Official Solicitor]], acting for the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], joined colleagues and counterparts from the [[Netherlands Radio Regulatory Authority]] to execute an armed raid on the ''Ross Revenge'' in which equipment was damaged or confiscated.\n\nPart of the raid was broadcast live<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://dxradio.co.uk/audio/Caroline_558_19aug1989.mp3|title = Dxradio|website = }}</ref> before officials disabled the transmitters. Dutch nationals were arrested and returned to the Netherlands, together with most of the broadcasting equipment. Non-Dutch staff were given the option of staying on the ship or returning to the Netherlands \u2013 most chose to stay on board. Caroline claimed boarding the ship and removal or destruction of equipment was [[piracy]]. The Dutch claimed the ship's Panamanian registration had lapsed in 1987 and it was not under legal protection from any country and that its transmissions breached international regulations which since 1982 had prohibited broadcasting from outside national territories. Several years later some of the seized items were returned to the station.\n\nIn 1990 the UK government amended the 1967 anti-offshore law to allow the boarding and silencing of stations in international waters if their signals could be received in the UK, even if their vessels were foreign-registered and operated. [[Noel Annan, Baron Annan|Lord Annan]], author of the 1977 [[Annan Committee|Report of the Committee on the Future of Broadcasting]], spoke in defence of Radio Caroline in the House of Lords at report stage on the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], saying \"Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1990/jun/05/broadcasting-bill#column_1257 |title=Hansard 5 June 1990 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> In a 1995 article for the pressure group [[Charter88]], Steve McGann commented: <blockquote> \"Whether Caroline was right to maintain her defiance for so many years is irrelevant. Her story illustrates how uniquely dangerous government regards an independent voice transmitted over unrestricted airwaves and to what ends it will go to silence it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/other/mcgann.html |title=The Real story of Radio Caroline |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=3 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163420/http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/other/mcgann.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref> </blockquote> This legislation remains in force.\n\n===1990\u20131991: After the raid===\nOn 1 October 1989, Radio Caroline restarted broadcasting from the ''Ross Revenge'' using makeshift equipment and low power, to retain the 558&nbsp;kHz frequency. Engineer Peter Chicago had hidden transmitter parts during the raid and retuned one 5&nbsp;kW transmitter, previously used on short-wave, to 558&nbsp;kHz. Over the following months, Caroline's signal quality improved as transmitting [[Vacuum tube|valves]] were donated and programming returned to normal.\n\nIn June 1990, [[Spectrum Radio]], a new multi-ethnic [[community radio]] station in London, was officially allocated 558&nbsp;kHz. Caroline caused more interference to Spectrum than vice versa. Caroline broadcast regular apologies to Spectrum listeners but refused to vacate the channel. Spectrum threatened to sue the [[Radio Authority]], which then allowed Spectrum to temporarily broadcast on 990&nbsp;kHz alongside 558&nbsp;kHz. Eventually, Caroline left 558&nbsp;kHz and moved to 819&nbsp;kHz. On 5 November 1990, lack of fuel and supplies forced the station to stop transmitting. The final song was ''[[Pilot of the Airwaves]]'' by [[Charlie Dore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/1st%20&%20Last%20A-L.htm |title=First & last |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |accessdate=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206115136/http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/1st%20%26%20Last%20A-L.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough most broadcasting staff left at that time, some remained for a year as caretakers while funding and equipment were sought.  The station tried to obtain a licence from a developing country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasradiogroup.org/caroline-movement |title=Caroline Movement |publisher=sasradiogroup |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> hoping it might offer protection from the new provisions in the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] which came into force on 31 December that year.\n\nIn November 1991, the ship lost its anchor in a storm and drifted on to the [[Goodwin Sands]] in the Channel. The crew was rescued by a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] helicopter. The ''Ross Revenge'' was salvaged and brought into harbour in Dover, ending 27 years of Radio Caroline's unlicensed offshore career.\n\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name             = Radio Caroline\n| area             = UK<br />Worldwide (Internet);<br />Europe (up to September 2013) ([[Eutelsat 28A]])\n| airdate          = 1999\n| frequency        = Various Internet streams<ref name=\"Radio Caroline Streams Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://carolinestreams.weebly.com/|title=Radio Caroline Streams Guide|publisher=Carolinestreams.weekly.com|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><br />[[UPC Ireland]]: Channel 927<br />[[Smallworld Cable]]: Channel 855<br /><br />[[Eutelsat 28A]] (to 30 September 2013):<br />Freq. 11.426 GHz <br />Polarisation: Horizontal<br />Symbol Rate: 27.5<br />FEC: 2/3\n| format           = AOR (Album/adult oriented)\n| owner            = Radio Caroline Ltd. and Caroline Support Group (originally called the Ross Revenge Support Group).\n| website          = [http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk]\n}}\n\n==Since 1991: Licensed Support Group era==\nSince 1991, the ''Ross Revenge'' has been maintained by enthusiasts called the ''Radio Caroline Support Group'', originally the ''Ross Revenge Support Group''.

Some of these 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence]] (RSL) broadcasts took place from the ''Ross Revenge'' during the 1990s, with the ship anchored off Clacton, in London's [[Canary Wharf]], [[Southend Pier]] and off the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in [[Kent]].\n\nAt one minute past midnight on 1 October 2001, Caroline returned on 1503&nbsp;kHz from the LV (Light Vessel) 18 in Harwich harbour. This two-day broadcast featured Phil Mitchell, Paul Dennis, Colin Lamb, John Patrick, Barry James, Steve Cisco and Clive Boutell.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. Martin van der Ven |url=http://www.radiocaroline.de/platt2.htm |title=Radio Caroline: Into the new millennium |publisher=Radiocaroline.de |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> The LV 18 was later used by the BBC for BBC Pirate Radio Essex broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/pirate/exhibition.shtml |title=Pirate BBC Essex |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother RSL broadcast ran from 7 August until 3 September 2004, with the ship moored at the cruise liner terminal jetty at Tilbury in Essex. It commemorated the 40th anniversary of Radio Caroline and promoted the station's legal internet and satellite programmes. The medium wave frequency was 235 metres (1278&nbsp;kHz) and programmes were sent through [[ISDN]] landline to [[Maidstone]] and via the internet and broadcast on satellite. The supermarket chain [[Asda]] and [[English Heritage]] were among the backers.\n\nThe station has subsequently broadcast on 531&nbsp;kHz AM from the ''Ross Revenge'' during some [[bank holiday]] weekends, beginning on 28\u201331 August 2009 and also within a few days of the 50th anniversary of the ship's first voyage.\n\n===Satellite and Internet broadcasting===\nUsing land-based studios leased in Kent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maidstonestudios.com/ |title=Home &#124; The Maistone Television Studios |publisher=Maidstonestudios.com |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> in the late 1990s, the station began broadcasting via satellites [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E]] and [[Eutelsat 28A]], covering [[western Europe]].

Radio Caroline continued on satellite but required manual tuning.\n\nDuring 2013, a survey showed a continued move from satellite reception and growth in internet listening.  Following negotiations with the service provider, satellite transmissions ended at midnight on 30 September 2013.

Original 1960s Caroline North jingles were interspersed with generic Radio Caroline ones.  The station played a wide selection of music from when Caroline started in the 1960s, but also included music from the 70s and 80s and early 90s to widen the audience profile.
