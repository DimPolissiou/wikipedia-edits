After two successive promotion-hunting campaigns ended at the play-off stage, he helped the Alex to automatic promotion in 1993\u201394. His goals impressed [[John Rudge]] at nearby Port Vale, and a \u00a3150,000 deal was struck between the two rival clubs in 1994. He went on to spend the next seven years at [[Vale Park]], playing in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] final in [[1995\u201396 Anglo-Italian Cup|1996]], as well as the club's [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] success in [[2001 Football League Trophy Final|2001]]. Three times Vale's top-scorer, he left on a free transfer to [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] in 2001. He helped Cheltenham to win promotion via the play-offs in [[2002 Football League Third Division play-off Final|2002]], before he entered the non-league scene with [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]] in 2003. He retired as a player in 2005, though would make brief a brief cameo at [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]] in 2006.\n\n==Playing career==\nNaylor began his career at non-league [[Droylsden F.C.|Droylsden]].

He is best known for his spells at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in the 1990s.\n\nHe moved to [[Dario Gradi]]'s Crewe from non-league [[Droylsden F.C.|Droylsden]] in 1990, turning professional at the age of 23. After two successive promotion-hunting campaigns ended at the play-off stage, he helped the Alex to automatic promotion in 1993\u201394. His goals impressed [[John Rudge]] at nearby Port Vale, and a \u00a3150,000 deal was struck between the two rival clubs in 1994. He went on to spend the next seven years at [[Vale Park]], playing in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] final in [[1995\u201396 Anglo-Italian Cup|1996]], as well as the club's [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] success in [[2001 Football League Trophy Final|2001]]. Three times Vale's top-scorer, he left on a free transfer to [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] in 2001. He helped Cheltenham to win promotion via the play-offs in [[2002 Football League Third Division play-off Final|2002]], before he entered the non-league scene with [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]] in 2003. He retired as a player in 2005, though would make brief a brief cameo at [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]] in 2006.\n\n==Playing career==\nNaylor began his career at non-league [[Droylsden F.C.|Droylsden]].
