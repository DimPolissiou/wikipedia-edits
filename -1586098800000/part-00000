For the army bands, he wrote many original scores (including the ''General Mulcahy March'' and six ''Irish Fantasias'') and arranged numerous Irish traditional tunes for military band.

He wrote a Symphony in D major that was performed in M\u00fcnster in 1908 and a number of other orchestral scores. For the army bands, he wrote many original scores (including the ''General Mulcahy March'' and six ''Irish Fantasias'') and arranged numerous Irish traditional tunes for military band. His first ''Irish Fantasia'' was played in 1926 at the opening broadcast of 2RN, the predecessor of today's [[Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann]].

Disbanded in 1919 as part of the post-war draw down, No. 41 Squadron was re-formed as an RAF squadron in 1923 and remained on home service until 1935 when it was deployed to Aden during the [[Abyssinian crisis]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the squadron flew [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters and saw action [[Dunkirk evacuation|over Dunkirk]] and the during the [[Battle of Britain]] in the early years of the war. Combat operations were flown from Britain over German-occupied Europe during 1941\u20131944, before the squadron moved to the continent after the [[Normandy landings]]. During 1944\u201345, the squadron supported the Allied advance into Germany and it remained there until mid-1946 as part of the occupation force following the end of hostilities. In the post war years, the squadron was disbanded and re-formed several times, operating a variety of jet aircraft in the fighter, reconnaissance and interceptor roles. In 2006, the squadron was re-roled as the Fast Jet & Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit.

These were replaced in early September 1916 with the [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.8]], and it was these aircraft which the squadron took on their deployment to [[Western Front (World War I)|France]] on 15 October 1916. Eighteen aircraft departed Gosport for the 225-mile flight to St. Omer, but only 12 actually made it, the others landing elsewhere with technical problems. The 12 pilots spent a week at St. Omer before moving to Abeele, where the ground crews reached them by road, and the remaining six pilots by rail, minus their aircraft.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">History of 41 Squadron, R.A.F., 1916\u20131927; TNA AIR 1/692/21/20/41</ref>\n\nThe F.E.8 was already obsolete as a pure fighter, and No. 41 used theirs mainly for [[Close air support|ground attack]]. On 24 January 1917, the squadron claimed its first victories. These fell to Sgt Plt Cecil Tooms, who himself was killed in action only four hours later.<ref name=\"RAF 1919\"/> While equipped with F.E.8s, the squadron participated in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (April\u2013May 1917) and the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] (June 1917). By this time the unit had become the last [[pusher configuration|\"pusher\"]] fighter squadron in the RFC. In July 1917 No. 41 were re-equipped with [[Airco DH 5|DH 5]] fighters, which proved disappointing; in October 1917  the squadron finally received [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5a]] fighters, with which they were equipped for the duration of the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe squadron provided distinguished service in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (November 1917), and subsequently in the German [[Spring Offensive]] (March 1918), and the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] (August 1918). 41 Squadron claimed its final victory of the war two days prior to the cessation of hostilities.<ref name=\"RAF 1919\"/> In the aftermath, the unit was reduced to a cadre of just 16 men on 7 February 1919 and returned to the United Kingdom. Their new base was [[Tangmere]], but they were moved to Croydon, Surrey, in early October and formally disbanded on 31 December 1919.<ref name=\"RAF 1919\"/>\n\nDuring the war, some seventeen [[Flying ace|ace]]s served with No. 41 Squadron, including; [[William Gordon Claxton]], [[Frederick McCall]], [[William Ernest Shields]], [[Eric John Stephens]], [[Frank Soden]], [[Russell Winnicott]], [[Geoffrey Hilton Bowman]], [[Roy W.

The unit had a remarkable number of Canadian aces in it\u2014ten out of the seventeen. The squadron's pilots and ground crews were awarded four [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], six [[Military Cross|MCs]], nine [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFCs]], two [[Military Medal|MMs]] and four [[Mentioned in dispatches|Mentions in Dispatches]] for their World War I service with the unit. The pilots were credited with destroying 111 aircraft and 14 balloons, sending down 112 aircraft out of control, and driving down 25 aircraft and five balloons. Thirty-nine men were killed or died on active service, 48 were wounded or injured, and 20 pilots became Prisoners of War.<ref>Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Operations Record Book for 41 Squadron RFC/RAF, Oct 1916 \u2013 Jan 1919, TNA AIR 1/1791/204/153/1-4 & 1/1792/204/153/5-6, 8 & 10, Recording Officer\u2019s Diary, 41 Squadron RAF, 9 Oct. 1916 \u2013 30 May 1917; TNA AIR 1/1791/204/153/11, and Record of Enemy Aircraft Brought Down, Jan. 1917-Nov. 1918, 41 Squadron RAF, TNA AIR 1/1792/204/153/16</ref>\n\n===Between the wars, 1923\u20131939===\n[[File:Armstrong-Whitworth Siskin ExCC.jpg|thumb|left|RAF Armstrong-Whitworth Siskin IIIa from No. 41 Squadron at Northolt being serviced with oxygen.]]\nThe squadron reformed at [[RAF Northolt]] on 1 April 1923, equipped with the [[Sopwith Snipe]].

At the end of May 1940, the squadron flew south to [[RAF Hornchurch]] to participate in the [[evacuation of Dunkirk]]. Twelve days later, they returned to RAF Catterick, claiming six Axis aircraft destroyed and one probable, but also left behind two pilots, the squadron's first pilot killed in action and their first lost as a prisoner of war.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Dunkirk\" /> After resting for a few weeks, the squadron headed south again on 26 July 1940, to participate in the first phase of the [[Battle of Britain]]. In its two-week tour, the Squadron claimed 10 Axis aircraft destroyed, four probables and three damaged, for the loss of one pilot killed and a second wounded.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAgain, 41 Squadron returned north to Catterick for a few weeks rest, but returned to Hornchurch on 3 September 1940, where they remained until the end of February 1941. They were now in the thick of the Battle of Britain. The price was high, but so was the damage they inflicted on the [[Luftwaffe]]. On 5 September, the squadron experienced one of its blackest days. The Commanding Officer and OC, B Flight, were killed in action and three other pilots were shot down and two were wounded in action; one of these was hospitalised for six months.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1940, the Battle of Britain was considered officially over. 49 pilots flew with the squadron between 10 July and 31 October 1940. Of these, 42 were British, 2 Canadian, 2 Irish and 2 New Zealanders. 10 were killed and 12 wounded in action (44% casualties). The squadron claimed over 100 victories from July 1940 to the end of that year.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/424, Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and Brew (2014), pp 281\u2013285.</ref>\n[[File:Spitfire IIA P7666.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sqn Ldr Donald O.

Only four pilots remained from the original 18 who landed in Hornchurch on 3 September 1940. However, in reality it is much worse: 16 pilots had been killed, five wounded and hospitalised (who did not return) and 15 otherwise posted away, in effect a 200% turnover since the unit's deployment to Hornchurch in early September. The squadron also now has its third Commanding Officer since then, and its fourth within ten months.<ref>Brew (2014), p. 357.</ref>\n\nFollowing five months rest in Catterick, during which the last Battle of Britain hardened pilots departed and new recruits joined from the [[BCATP|British Commonwealth Air Training Program]], the squadron headed south to Merston, [[Sussex]], on 28 July 1941, to join the Tangmere Wing, where the [[wing leader]] was [[Douglas Bader]]. There followed an intensive period of offensive activity over France.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425, and Brew (2014), p. 430.</ref>\n\nOn 12 February 1942, 41 Squadron took part in the attack on the German Kriegsmarine's {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} after they escaped from Brest and made a dash up the Channel to the safety of their home ports. During these actions, 41 Squadron claimed three German aircraft destroyed and one damaged, but lost one pilot who failed to return.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425, and Brew (2014), pp. 580\u2013587.</ref>\n\nThe squadron also supported the ill-fated Canadian landings at [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] ([[Operation Jubilee]]) on 19 August 1942, completing three squadron-strength missions over the beaches. The pilots returned from the third without the Officer Commanding, Sqn Ldr Geoffrey Hyde, who was hit by Flak and killed; he was the squadron's only casualty that day.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425, and Brew (2012), pp. 23\u201339.</ref>\n\nTired, after a busy summer on the south coast fending off Me109s and FW190s fulfilling the Luftwaffe's \"hit and run\" strategy, the squadron was taken off operations until February 1943 and sent to [[Llanbedr]], [[Wales]], for an extended period of rest. This heralded the start of an intensive period of turnover in the unit's ranks as men were rested and fresh pilots brought in.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425.</ref>\n\nIn February 1943, the unit became the first of only two squadrons to receive the new [[Supermarine Spitfire (Griffon-powered variants)|Griffon-engine Spitfire]] Mark XII. Having rested, re-equipped and trained on the new aircraft, the squadron was sent back onto operations in April 1943, and claimed their first definitive victory in over ten months on 17 April. This was also the first by the RAF in the Mk. XII Spitfire.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425</ref>\n\n[[File:Supermarine Spitfire F Mk XIIs of 41 Sqn.jpg|thumbnail|right|41 Squadron Spitfire XIIs in an Air Ministry photograph dated 12 April 1944.

On D-Day itself, 6 June 1944, three pilots were hit by Flak over the bridgehead and one was killed. On 19 June, however, the squadron was pulled off air support for the bridgehead in France and was deployed solely in the destruction of Germany's newest weapon, the [[V-1 flying bomb]].<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/426, and Brew (2012), Chapter 6.</ref> On 28 August 1944, the squadron claimed its last of 53 V1s destroyed during the war. Several pilots succeeded in bringing them down after expending all their ammunition, by flying alongside them and placing their own wingtips underneath that of the V1. The wind movement between both wingtips was sufficient to upset the V1's gyroscope and send crashing it to the ground.<ref>Brew (2012), p. 498.</ref>\n\nThe squadron was re-equipped with the Spitfire XIV in September 1944 and during the ensuing three months participated in 'Big Ben' operations against V2 launch sites, in [[Operation Market Garden]] at [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]], in operations in the [[Walcheren]] campaign, and in the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Allied Oil Campaign]] over [[Germany]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/426.</ref>\n\nThe squadron moved to the continent in early December 1944, making its base at [[Diest]] in Belgium. Ground targets were the squadron's chief prey as a member of 125 Wing, and the unit attacked anything moving on road, rail or canal in [[Germany]]. Operating so close to the ground, Flak also took its toll on pilots and aircraft. One pilot was killed, three wounded and two shot down and taken prisoner.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn April 1945, the squadron moved forward with the advancing front and made its first base in Germany, just southwest of the town of [[Celle]], 140 miles (225&nbsp;km) due west of [[Berlin]], and only a short distance southeast of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]]. During April and early May 1945, German resistance crumbled. 41 Squadron claimed 33 enemy aircraft destroyed, two probably destroyed and three damaged in the air and 21 damaged on the ground, in the 23 days preceding 3 May 1945 (the date of the squadron's final claim). Their own casualties for the same period were no pilots killed or wounded in action, and no aircraft lost to enemy action, although some did sustain combat damage.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/426, and Brew (2012), Chapter 10.</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft of the Royal Air Force, 1939-1945- Supermarine Spitfire.

By the end of the war, 41 Squadron had claimed 200 aircraft destroyed, 61 probably destroyed, 109 damaged and 53 V-1s destroyed. On 31 March 1946, still based on the Continent, 41 Squadron was disbanded by re-numbering to 26 Squadron.<ref name=\"Squadron Operations Record Book 2413\">41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/2413.</ref>\n\nThe squadron had two mascots during the war: 'Wimpy', a Bull Terrier with the tip of one ear missing, at Catterick in 1939\u201340, and 'Perkin', a large black French Poodle, in 1943\u201344.<ref>\"Flying Made My arms Ache\", Wally Wallens DFC, and 41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425.</ref> The squadron's 325 World War II pilots were men from Britain, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palestine, Poland, White Russia, Rhodesia, South Africa, Trinidad, Uruguay, the United States, and Zululand.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Books, TNA AIR 27/424-426, Brew (2014), pp. 748\u2013818 (Pilot Biographies 1939\u201342), and Brew (2012), pp. 776\u2013831 (Pilot Biographies 1942\u201345).</ref>\n\n41 Squadron's pilots were awarded three [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], 21 [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFCs]], one [[Distinguished Flying Medal|DFM]] and one [[Mentioned in dispatches|Mention in Dispatches]] for their World War II service with the unit. Sixty four were killed in action or died on active service, 58 were wounded in action or injured in accidents, three were shot down but evaded capture and returned to the United Kingdom, and 21 pilots were shot down and became Prisoners of War.

F.21.<ref name=\"Squadron Operations Record Book 2413\"/>\n\nThe squadron flew its Spitfires for the last time on 18 August 1947, and became No. 41 Instrument Flying Rating Squadron, equipped with the Airspeed Oxfords & North American Harvard. However, in June the following year, the squadron reverted to fighter defence and was re-equipped with the [[De Havilland Hornet]] F.1, followed later by the F.3.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\"/>\n\n41 Squadron became a day fighter unit again in January 1951 and entered the jet age, receiving its first jet-powered aircraft, the [[Gloster Meteor|Gloster Meteor F.4]]. In April 1951 these were replaced by the [[Gloster Meteor|Gloster Meteor F.8]], and four years later the squadron received the [[Hawker Hunter]] F.5.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" /> On 14 July 1957, the squadron was presented with a Standard displaying the unit's Battle Honours by the CAS, Air Marshal Sir [[Theodore McEvoy]] KCB CBE, who had served three years with 41 Squadron as a young officer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/McEvoy.htm|title=Air Chief Marshal Sir Theodore McEvoy (16181)|last=|first=|date=|website=Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> following his graduation from [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|RAF College, Cranwell]] in 1925.<ref>The Times, 13 May & 5 July 1957</ref>\n\nHowever, no amount of nostalgia would save the unit from the Government's budgetary axe. On 15 January 1958, as a part of a scheme to reduce the size of [[RAF Fighter Command]], 41 Squadron fell to the same fate as [[No. 600 Squadron RAF|600]] and [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadron]]s had before it, and were also disbanded. With the departure of 41 Squadron from RAF Biggin Hill ceased to be a Fighter Command airfield, its infrastructure now deemed out of date for the requirements of modern warfare. The runways had become too short for the RAF's newest generation of aircraft and, as a result of encroaching development and civil air paths which now passed above, the base was no longer in a practical location. Fighter Command officially departed from the airfield on 1 March 1958.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://bigginhill.co.uk/rafstation.htm|title=Royal Air Force Station Biggin Hill|last=|first=|date=|website=Biggin Hill Web Site|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThis gave 41 Squadron the curious distinction of being the last fighter squadron ever to be based at Biggin Hill. The departure of the unit marked the end of an era for the Station in every sense of the word, as thereafter it was relegated to non-operational status and only used by the London [[University Air Squadron]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:41 Sqn Jaguar 01APR06.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Jaguar of outgoing Officer Commanding 41 Squadron, Wg Cdr R.

On 16 January 1958, just a day after being disbanded, [[No. 141 Squadron RAF|141 Squadron]], based at [[RAF Coltishall]], near Norwich in Norfolk, dropped the '1' at the beginning of its number and was thus reborn as 41 Squadron.

By this time, [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56 Squadron]] had also joined them at the station. Whilst there, they hosted [[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Super Myst\u00e8re]] fighters during President [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s state visit in April 1960. 41 Squadron called Wattisham home for approximately five-and-a-half years, before the unit was disbanded again, on 31 December 1963.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nOn 1 September 1965, after a 20-month break, 41 Squadron was re-formed at [[RAF West Raynham]], near Fakenham in Norfolk, but this time as a completely different structure. The unit remained firmly on the ground as a missile defence squadron, armed with [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bloodhound Mk. II]] surface-to-air-missile (SAM). Changes to the SAM programme, however, saw 41 Squadron disbanded yet again just five years later, on 18 September 1970.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" /> The squadron standard was moved to the Church of St. Michael and St. George at RAF West Raynham, for safe-keeping.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\"/>\n\nOn 1 April 1972, at [[RAF Coningsby]] in Lincolnshire, the squadron was reborn as a tactical fighter reconnaissance and ground attack unit within [[No. 38 Group RAF|38 Group]] Air Support Command. To support them in their reconnaissance role, a \"Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre\" or \"RIC\" was formed. The RIC is composed of a number of Air Transportable Reconnaissance Exploitation Laboratories which enable the developing of images and their subsequent analysis. The ATRELs can be transported by air or road and can be deployed with the squadron to forward operating bases.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\"/>\n[[File:41 Sqn Tornado & Harrier Flypast Oct06.jpg|thumbnail|right|A flypast of a 41 Squadron Tornado and three 41 Squadron Harriers, RAF Coningsby, October 2006.]]\nIn this role, they were equipped with [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in UK service|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom FGR.2s]] but these were soon deemed to be unsuitable for the unit. Over the ensuing years, a strategic decision was made to change the role of the RAF's Phantoms from a fighter to an interceptor. This amendment, however, created consternation within some circles as it was felt the squadron should maintain its role as a fighter and ground attack unit. Consequently, it was resolved to disband 41 Squadron and re-form it elsewhere to enable it to do so.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nIn preparation for this change, \"41 Designate Squadron\" was formed at RAF Coltishall, in Norfolk, on 1 July 1976 and commenced training as a reconnaissance unit with [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] GR.1 aircraft. The two squadrons operated independently of one another until 31 March 1977 when 41 Squadron was disbanded at Coningsby. This allowed 41 Designate Squadron to drop 'Designate' from their name, take possession of the standard, adopt the squadron badge, and become the new combat-ready 41 Squadron at RAF Coltishall a day later.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n[[File:41 Sqn Jaguar XZ103 01APR06.jpg|thumbnail|left|41 Squadron Jaguar XZ103 Tailfin, RAF Coltishall, 1 April 2006.]]\n41 Squadron's role changed to low-level reconnaissance and, in early 1978, it became part of [[SACEUR]]'s Strategic Reserve. In 1980, the unit was assigned to the [[Allied Command Europe Mobile Force]] and was subsequently involved in exercises at [[Bardufoss Airport|Bardufoss]] in Norway and in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.targetlock.org.uk/jaguar/service_uk.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113238/http://www.targetlock.org.uk/jaguar/service_uk.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn support of its reconnaissance role, the unit formed a RIC at Coltishall to process and interpret the photographs made by pilots, using sensors located in a large external pod. The film was taken to the MAREL's (Mobile Aerial Reconnaissance Exploitation Laboratories) for processing and interpretation. Ideally, a mission report would have been generated within 45 minutes of 'engines off'. Smaller \"air-portable\" RICs were also used during off-base deployments.<ref>http://www.ctlopez.com/story/?story=20011026_3847</ref>\n\nAs a result of this ability, the squadron has been involved in a number of conflicts over the past two decades. In early 1991, during the First Gulf War ([[Operation Granby]], but more widely known by its American name, \"[[Desert Storm]]\"), a large number of reconnaissance and bombing missions were flown against Iraqi forces with [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguar GR.1A]] aircraft as a part of the coalition forces.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nIn its aftermath, the squadron was deployed to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], in southwest Turkey, where it participated in the defence of Iraq's Kurdish minority within the boundaries of the country's northern no-fly zone (Operations \"Warden\" and \"Resinate North\") until April 1993. It was during this period that the large external photographic pods were replaced with smaller, more versatile, medium level pods.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFour months later, the squadron was deployed to southern Italy, where it flew policing duties over Bosnia in support of [[Operation Deny Flight]] until August 1995. It was during this time that one of the unit's Jaguars became the first RAF aircraft to drop a bomb in anger over Europe since the end of World War II. The target was a Bosnian Serb tank.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nThe squadron returned to Coltishall in August 1995 for a well-earned rest. Despite the vital work they had performed in Iraq and Bosnia, however, the squadron found their photographic systems were inhibited by the use of photographic film, which required special handling and processing before any results could be viewed and analysed. This drawback was compounded by the inherent difficulties of moving hardcopy prints around the battlefield, particularly with the distances involved in modern warfare. To overcome these issues, the Jaguar Replacement Reconnaissance Pod (JRRP) was introduced in August 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airrecce.co.uk/postww2/ac/Jaguar/Jaguar.html|title=Sepecat Jaguar Recce Pod, 601GP(1), DJRP|last=|first=|date=|website=www.airrecce.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThe new system provided for the recording of a digital images by three cameras onto VHS-C super videotapes with electro optical sensors for day operations and infra-red sensors for night operations. Digital images were then analysed in the ATRELs through in a windows-based application, named \u2018Ground Imagery Exploitation System\u2019, or \"GIES\".

A White Paper, titled \"Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities\", foresaw the retirement of the RAF's Jaguar aircraft two years early and the closure of RAF Coltishall. Advances in technology, it reasoned, would mean air defence could be maintained with fewer aircraft, thus allowing older equipment to be withdrawn from service earlier than originally intended. The authors planned that the RAF's future air combat force would be based around the multi-role Typhoon and Joint Combat Aircraft, in co-operation with the [[Panavia Tornado IDS|Tornado GR4]] and [[BAe Harrier|Harrier GR7/GR9]]. Furthermore, the paper intended to reduce RAF trained strength from 48,500 to 41,000 by 1 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/147C7A19-8554-4DAE-9F88-6FBAD2D973F9/0/cm6269_future_capabilities.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802083938/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/147C7A19-8554-4DAE-9F88-6FBAD2D973F9/0/cm6269_future_capabilities.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-08-02|title=Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities|page=9}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of these decisions, every one of RAF Coltishall's units would be directly affected.

However, their disbandment had little immediate effect on the activity at Coltishall as most airframes and personnel were absorbed into 6 and 41 Squadrons. However, with the departure of these latter squadrons in 2006, and the subsequent closure of the base in December, the close-knit RAF community was dispersed to other locations, and a quiet returned to the area, which has not existed since May 1940.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiritofcoltishall.com/history|title=Royal Air Force Coltishall|last=|first=|date=|website=Spirit of Coltishall Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite the Government's intention to disband 41 Squadron, and plans drawn up for final ceremonies to take place on the first weekend in April 2006, the unit was given a new lease on life only a short while before taking effect.

He left the RAF in 1922 to work for Vickers-Armstrong. In 1934, however, he formed the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company with his colleague James Martin, to design new aircraft and offer flying lessons. One of their more notable pupils was Amy Johnson. The company went on to manufacture and market four different propeller aircraft, but Baker himself was killed in a flying accident in 1942, whilst test-flying the third of these. It was his death, however, that caused his business partner to rethink safety and develop a means of assisted escape for pilots. As a result, Martin-Baker began to manufacture ejection seats in 1946, and still does today for both fixed wing and rotary military aircraft. Amongst 80 types of aircraft into which their seats have been fitted are the Jaguar, which 41 Squadron flew from 1977\u20132006, the Harrier, which the squadron flew from 2006\u20132010, and the Tornado and Typhoon, both of which they fly today. Martin-Baker ejection seats are now being fitted into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Over 70,000 Martin-Baker ejection seats have been delivered to 93 air forces, which have saved almost 7,500 lives. It is a squadron legacy that in giving his own life, Baker has saved the lives of thousands of others.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Valentine Henry Baker funeral brochure | publisher=Martin-Baker Co. | year=1942 | url=http://www.rainydaygallery.co.uk/valentinebaker.html}}</ref>\n* American Lieutenant [[Eugene Hoy Barksdale|Eugene Barksdale]] served with 41 Squadron from July\u2013October 1918, during which time he claimed two victories and was wounded in action. In October 1918, he transferred to the American Expeditionary Force and returned home to become as USAAF test pilot. Clearly a talented pilot in this early era of flight, he is perhaps best known for having flown an Airco DH-4 light bomber from McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, to Mitchel Field, which became Mitchel AFB in New York, a distance of some 600 miles solely on instruments. However, in August 1926, whilst testing a Douglas O-2 observation aircraft for spin characteristics over McCook Field, he was unable to recover the aircraft and was killed. Buried with full military honours at Arlington National Cemetery, the USAF's [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] near [[Bossier City, Louisiana]], was named in his honour when opened in February 1933. The base is currently home to five squadrons of B52 Stratofortresses.

His achievements on 41 were recognised with the award of a DSO and a DFC. Following the war, McCall was employed in civil aviation, and subsequently served at home as a Squadron Leader in the RCAF during World War II. He died in 1949, aged just 53, but by that time had dedicated over 30 years of his life to flying. In recognition of his service to Canadian aviation, a new airfield in Calgary was named McCall Field in his honour.

Along with his significant victory tally, he was very much a legend in his own time. Collishaw retired in October 1943 and spent the rest of the war as a Regional Air Liaison Officer for Civil Defence UK.

He was credited with 11 victories, and awarded two Military Crosses. Following the war, he commanded 204 and 70 Squadrons, and then spent four years in instructing roles at Cranwell. For the following 11 years from the mid-1920s, he fulfilled armament and ordinance roles in the United Kingdom and Middle East, with the exception of a 20-month period between February 1930 and October 1931 when he commanded 41 Squadron. Returning to ordinance in March 1938, he became vice president of the Ordnance Committee at Woolwich Arsenal and then the Director of Armament Development with the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1940, reporting to [[Lord Beaverbrook]]. In April 1941, however, Huskinson and his wife were seriously injured by Luftwaffe night-time bombing in the Blitz and Huskinson was blinded. Following nine months\u2019 convalescence, he was retired as an Air Commodore in January 1942. However, he immediately became the president of the Air Armament Board, which post he held until 1945. In this role, he was involved in the development of large bunker-busting bombs, such as the [[Tallboy bomb|Tall Boy]], and in several other technologies, despite his handicap. In 1945, he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] and the U.S. Legion of Merit for his work in this role. Huskinson also wrote an autobiography in 1949 called 'Vision Ahead', which explains his career in some detail. He also recalls his \"very happy years in charge of Number 41 Squadron\". It was also Huskinson who wrote to the Mayor of St. Omer and obtained permission for 41 Squadron to use part of the Town Arms in its badge.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Huskinson.htm |title=Air Commodore P.

Wheeler]] CBE was granted a Short Service Commission in 1924, and served on 41 Squadron as a Flight Commander from September 1933 to August 1936. During this time, he was deployed to Aden with the squadron, arriving there six weeks ahead of the main group and aircraft, as a member of the advance party. From 1940 to 1944, Wheeler's postings related to experimental aircraft and aircraft development, both with the Performance Testing Squadron at [[Boscombe Down]] and the Aircraft & Armament Experimental Establishment at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]], for which he was mentioned in dispatches. Between February and October 1944, Wheeler was Station Commander at RAF [[Fairford]] where he was involved in glider deployment for D-Day operations and the Arnhem landings. His contribution was recognised with the award of an OBE in the 1945 New Year's Honours. Following further postings, including to Asia and the Mediterranean, Wheeler returned to the Aircraft & Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe as it Commandant. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] whilst there and retired in May 1955. Wheeler was subsequently employed as an aviation consultant and technical advisor to the film industry, and worked on such films as 'The Blue Max' and 'Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines', and was even used as a pilot in the latter movie.<ref>\"Air Commodore Allen Wheeler.\" Times [London, England] 5 January 1984: 12.

He served as 41 Squadron's Intelligence Officer for over five years of the War, and reported the squadron's activity, victories and losses up the chain of command on a daily basis. He refused further promotion.<ref>Obituary: Thomas Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough, The Times 2 March 1951; Issue 51939</ref>\n* Squadron Leader [[George Bennions]] was posted to 41 Squadron in February 1936. It was here that he remained for the ensuing almost five years, and he was commissioned on the Sqn in April 1940. Bennions proved to be quite a talented pilot, and he claimed his first victory over the Channel in July 1940, during the earliest salvoes of the [[Battle of Britain]]. Over the months of August and September, Bennions\u2019 tally continued to rise to the point where he had claimed ten and one shared destroyed, seven probably destroyed, and five damaged, making him the second most successful pilot on 41 Squadron during World War II. Aside from his significant victory tally during the Battle of Britain, Bennions is of interest for one of those victories, which took place on 5 September 1940. Contemporary researchers credit him with a shared victory over Oblt [[Franz von Werra]], the Group Adjutant of JG3, who was flying an Me109E. Von Werra's aircraft is believed to have been damaged by Bennions but finished off by 603 Squadron's [[Gerald Stapleton|Plt Off Basil Stapleton]], forcing the German pilot to crash-land near Marden, Kent. Von Werra was captured unhurt and sent to Canada, as were the majority of German POWs, to hinder their chances of escape. However, von Werra nonetheless succeeded in escaping, and returned to Germany in April 1941. So unusual was this feat that he was the only German POW to succeed in doing so during the War. Von Werra's story was the subject of a book, and also of a film entitled 'The One That Got Away', which was released in 1957 and starred Hardy Kr\u00fcger as von Werra.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454022/Squadron-Leader-Ben-Bennions.html |title=Obituary \u2013 Squadron Leader 'Ben' Bennions|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=12 February 2004|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric.S.Lock.jpg|thumbnail|right|Flt Lt Eric S. Lock, July 1941]]\n* Pilot Officer [[Eric Lock]] joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in February 1939 and was posted to 41 Squadron as his first operational unit, in mid-June 1940. Lock's first operational sortie took place on 9 August 1940, which was uneventful, as was his second a few days later. However, between 15 August and 17 November 1940, Lock claimed no less than 22 aircraft destroyed, and he became the most successful RAF pilot of the Battle of Britain and the equal second highest-scoring pilot in the RAF at the time. Over the three consecutive months of September, October and November 1940, Lock was awarded a DFC, a Bar, and a DSO. On the afternoon of 5 September 1940, 41 Squadron's most intensive day of the [[Battle of Britain]], Lock claimed three victories in a single sortie. The aircraft he flew that day, Spitfire Ia, N3162, EB-G, is recognised by 41 Squadron, which has the letters EB-G on one of their Typhoons, and by the BBMF, which has EB-G emblazoned on their Spitfire P7350. Lock was seriously wounded in action on 17 November 1940, and underwent multiple operations, which included three skin grafts at the hands of Dr. [[Archibald McIndoe]] at [[East Grinstead]]. Following seven months\u2019 recuperation, he returned to operations with 611 Squadron in late June 1941. During July 1941, he added another three victories to his already impressive list, but on 3 August, he failed to return from a routine operation after attacking a German column on a road behind Boulogne. In recognition of his achievements and status in Battle of Britain history, he is remembered on several memorials and in his hometown of [[Bayston Hill]], outside Shrewsbury, where a street is named after him. He remains today one of the RAF's top ten Aces of World War II, credited with some 25 aircraft destroyed and 7 probably destroyed, all bar three of which he achieved on 41 Squadron.<ref>Shores, Christopher (1983).

In July 1944, by now OC, 602 Squadron, Le Roux was credited with attacking and seriously injuring General [[Erwin Rommel]] in his staff car, on a road outside Sainte Foy de Montgomerie, in Normandy. Strafing the vehicle, the driver lost control, struck a tree and spun off the road. Rommel fractured his skull when he was thrown from the vehicle. In doing so, Le Roux single-handedly removed Germany's commanding general from the Normandy battlefield.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol014dt.html | title=South African Air Aces of World War II | author=Tidy, D | date= June 1969 | volume=1 | issue=4}}</ref>\n* Dutch Flight Lieutenant [[Bram van der Stok]] was posted to 41 Squadron as a Fg Off in December 1941. Promoted to Actg Flt Lt and appointed OC A Flight in March 1942, he quickly claimed two victories, but was shot down over France the following month. Taken into immediate captivity, he was sent to [[Stalag Luft III]], Sagan, where he remained until March 1944 when he took part in the mass escape of airmen that we know today as [[Stalag Luft III escape|The Great Escape]]. All but three of the escapees were recaptured and fifty of them were executed as retribution on Hitler's orders. Of the three that successfully made their escapes, van der Stok was one. Acting as a Dutch labourer on forged papers, he made it back the United Kingdom in early July 1944, travelling on a route, which took him through the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain and Gibraltar. In 1963, [[United Artists]] released the film, 'The Great Escape', based upon a book of the same name, written by Australian author [[Paul Brickhill]] in 1950. In the movie, a character broadly based on van der Stok was played by [[James Coburn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5648616/Bram-van-der-Stok.html|work=[[the Daily Telegraph]]|title=Obituary: Bram van der Stok|date=1 July 1993|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Canadian Sergeant Pilot [[George Beurling|George F. Beurling]] was posted to 41 Squadron in April 1942, but proved too head-strong, fought with other members of the unit, and gained a reputation for doing his own thing in the air and not remaining in formation or following orders. By the following month, he was requesting a transfer to Malta and it was granted. Nonetheless, in his brief time with 41 Squadron, he claimed his first two victories. In time, he became Canada's leading World War II ace, and was credited with 31 victories between May 1942 and December 1943. As a result, he was awarded a DSO, a DFC and two DFMs. However, he was 'retired' early from the RCAF in 1944 as his skill in cockpit was matched by streak of rebelliousness, and disrespect for authority. He had a reputation for ignoring team tactics and breaking formation to attack the enemy alone and had gained two nicknames, 'Buzz Beurling' and the not-so-complimentary 'Screwball Beurling'.<ref>[http://www.acesofww2.com/Canada/aces/beurling/ \"George Frederick \"Screwball\" Beurling.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615051531/http://www.acesofww2.com/Canada/aces/beurling/ |date=15 June 2013 }} ''acesofww2.com'.

He fled Russia with his parents and siblings in the wake of the October Revolution in 1917, and settled in England, where he was educated. Galitzine joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve on a Short Service Commission in late 1938, but left again to go to Finland in early 1940 to fight the Soviets attempting to occupy the country. Returning to London again in October 1940, after his mother was killed in the Blitz, Galitzine rejoined the RAFVR, but had to do so as an aircraftsman, though he was recommissioned in September 1941. Galitzine saw operational service in several squadrons before joining 41 Squadron as a Fg Off in May 1943, and he claimed a probably destroyed enemy aircraft with the unit in October. Following his tenure with the squadron, he was rested as personal assistant to Air Vice-Marshal Sir William Dickson, then commanding 83 Group, which was preparing for the Normandy invasion. When Dickson was posted to Italy, Galitzine accompanied him, adding Italian to an already impressive list of languages he spoke. Following the War, Galitzine worked in the civil aviation industry, but maintained links with Russia and, in 1998, attended the reburial and funeral service of the murdered Tsar and his family in St Petersburg.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1418277/Prince-Emanuel-Galitzine.html|title=Prince Emanuel Galitzine|date=9 January 2003|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Flying Officer Peter Gibbs was a generally unassuming character who served with 41 Squadron between January 1944 and March 1945. He was an active pilot during his tour and an avid musician. He became a professional musician after he left the RAF in August 1945 and joined the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1954. Within two years, he had joined the London Symphony Orchestra and during this time became (in)famous for a dressing down he gave to one of the Century's most celebrated performing artists, Herbert von Karajan. The orchestra felt von Karajan had been unprofessional when conducting smaller, \u2018less important\u2019 concerts during a tour of the United States in 1956. He had often just bowed once and left the stage at the end of concerts, refusing to return for encores, despite the applause from the audience. The orchestra was slighted by this behaviour, and eventually had had enough. The last straw came when von Karajan left the stage in Boston after the last note was played, neither waiting for applause nor calls for an encore. The orchestra, in which Gibbs was playing first violin, was upset by this apparent insult to both them and the audience, but turned up nonetheless on time for an early rehearsal the following morning. Von Karajan, however, came in late, much to the disgruntlement of the orchestra. When he finally arrived, Peter Gibbs, an impromptu, self-appointed spokesman, stood up and addressed him directly, demanding an apology. He rebuked von Karajan, stating, \"I did not spend four years of my life fighting bastards like you to be insulted before our own allies as you did last evening.\" Von Karajan ignored him completely and continued conducting as if nothing had happened. That night, however, during a concert, von Karajan chose his moment and, during the interval, refused to go back on stage until a letter was signed stating that Gibbs be immediately sacked. The orchestra's managers had little choice but to bow to the demand. Although Gibbs was never to play with the Philharmonia again after this incident, it is understood that von Karajan also never conducted the Philharmonia again after the tour either, and it is said that he vowed to never conduct an English orchestra again. All this time, Gibbs also flew privately. He had joined the Surrey Flying Club in June 1957 and then flew more-or-less continuously for the next 18 years. Gibbs bought himself a Tiger Moth and enjoyed peacetime flying. However, flying was also what brought about his premature death in December 1975. He took off for a brief flight in a Cessna from Glenforsa Airfield on the Isle of Mull in Scotland on Christmas Eve 1975, but failed to return. A search was mounted but no trace whatsoever could be found of him. Oddly, his body was found four months after his disappearance part way up a hill, approximately one mile from Glenforsa Airfield, without his aircraft, showing the signs of having lain there all that time. The original search for Gibbs had passed through the area at the time he had gone missing, but nothing had been seen. His body gave away no clues as to his cause of death. Gibbs\u2019 missing Cessna bewildered officials and his case soon became known as the \u2018Great Mull Air Mystery\u2019. It was not until September 1986 \u2013 almost 11 years after Gibbs\u2019 death \u2013 that his aircraft was located in the sea off Oban. The aircraft's remains also gave up no clue as to the reason it was there. It can only be assumed that Gibbs, for some reason, came down in the sea and that he had managed to free himself and swim ashore. It is thought he then tried to make his way back to the airfield, around a mile away, but, considering the time of year, location, and likely temperatures of both the water and air, probably succumbed to the effects of exposure.<ref>Brew (2012), p. 671.</ref>\n\n[[File:Aharon Remez.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aharon Remez, who served as an NCO pilot with 41 Squadron in 1945, became the first Commander of the Israeli Air Force in 1948]]\n* Palestinian Sergeant Pilot [[Aharon Remez]] was posted to his first and only operational unit, 41 Squadron, in April 1945 and served with the unit until March 1946, and was not commissioned in the RAF. Based in Germany during the last weeks of the war and beyond, he witnessed Nazi atrocities first hand, and often lent a personal hand. The officers of 41 Squadron turned a blind eye, and he was given special leave to allow him to be able to do so. This enabled him to commence assisted passage for many holocaust survivors to the Middle East. Remez left the RAF in 1946 and returned home to champion the formation of a Jewish State. This occurred in May 1948, and in July he was given the post of Brigadier General and the founder and first Commanding Officer of the Israeli Air Force. He held this post until December 1950. Remez was subsequently the Head of Purchasing Delegation, Israeli MOD mission to the United States, the Israeli Defence Minister's Aide for Aviation, a member of the House Committee & Foreign Affairs & Defense Committees of the 3rd Knesset, Director of the Dept for International Co-operation in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Director General of the Israeli Ports Authority, and Chairman of the Israeli Aviation Authority. Remez was also the Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdom from May 1965 to July 1970 and often met up with his former 41 Squadron colleagues from 1945 whilst based there.<ref>Brew (2012), pp. 707 & 815.</ref>\n* Squadron Leader [[Terry Spencer (RAF officer)|Terry Spencer]] was originally commissioned with the Royal Engineers in December 1939, he transferred to the RAFVR as a Plt Off in October 1941. Following training, he was posted to 26 Squadron at Gatwick in November 1942 and remained with this unit until February 1944, in that time being promoted to Flt Lt and he left the unit as a Flight Commander. Following a brief posting to 165 Squadron, Spencer was posted to 41 Squadron as OC A Flt at the beginning of May 1944. Arriving just prior to D-Day, he led the Squadron on a number of operations in advance support of the invasion, and then led the unit on anti-Diver operations from June 1944, when the V1 Doodlebug menace commenced. Within four months, he had become a V1 Ace, with seven shot down, and also claimed a destroyed German fighter, thereby ending the career of a 171-victory Luftwaffe Ace Emil 'Bully' Lang. Spencer was posted to 350 Squadron within the same Wing to take command on 4 January 1945. On 26 February, however, he was hit by Flak over Germany and captured. A month later, he escaped from camp by bicycle, and subsequently motorcycle, with another former 41 Sqn pilot, Sqn Ldr Keith 'Jimmy' Thiele, in a Steve-McQueen-style getaway, in which the pair made it back to Allied lines. Spencer returned to 350 Squadron, where he once again took over command on 2 April 1945. Only 17 days later, he was shot down once again, this time over Wismar Bay, in northern Germany. Blown out of his cockpit, the force deployed his parachute at a height of just 30\u201340 feet, which he miraculously survived, only to be captured again. The successful jump has since been credited by the Guinness Book of Records as having been the lowest authenticated survived bale-out on record. Spencer was injured and hospitalised, but liberated by advancing Allied armies approximately two weeks later. He was awarded an immediate DFC for his exploits. In 1947, he was also awarded the Territorial Efficiency Medal and the Belgian Croix de Guerre with Palm. Spencer was demobbed in December 1945 and headed to South Africa in spring 1946, taking three weeks to fly himself there in a single-engined Percival Proctor. He was employed there as the personal pilot of Ben du Preez, Managing Director of Kimlite Industries, which was a cover for illicit diamond buying. Spencer then returned to the United Kingdom where he met the actress [[Lesley Brook]], who starred in at least 24 films between 1937 and 1948. They married in August 1947 and resided for a time on the Isle of Wight, before returning to South Africa in July 1948. On this occasion, he launched a new career by founding the aerial photography company in October that same year. The company enjoyed some success, but he was to become a more successful freelance photographer for [[LIFE Magazine]], for whom he worked between September 1952 and September 1972. During his time with LIFE, he covered several conflicts, including Biafra, Congo, and the Vietnam War, and spent three months on tour with a then little-known band called [[The Beatles]]. When LIFE folded in 1972, Spencer moved to People magazine, where he spent the ensuing 20 years. He authored and published two books, the first a renowned coffee table book about The Beatles ('It was Thirty Years Ago Today'), and the second an autobiography ('Living Dangerously'), which he co-authored with his wife. Following his death in February 2009, [[The Times]] published a glowing obituary of a man who was a real-life adventurer, and whose life and exploits were the very stuff of \u2018Boys Own\u2019 magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612043733/http://home.scarlet.be/~braf/350Sqn/biographies/spencert.htm|title=Sqn Ldr Terry Spencer|publisher=350 Squadron|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Key dates 1916\u20132016===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its official title is \"41 TES\". The squadron was formed in 1916 during [[First World War]] as part of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a ground attack and fighter squadron. Disbanded in 1919 as part of the post-war draw down, No. 41 Squadron was re-formed as an RAF squadron in 1923 and remained on home service until 1935 when it was deployed to Aden during the [[Abyssinian crisis]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the squadron flew [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters and saw action [[Dunkirk evacuation|over Dunkirk]] and the during the [[Battle of Britain]] in the early years of the war. Combat operations were flown from Britain over German-occupied Europe during 1941\u20131944, before the squadron moved to the continent after the [[Normandy landings]]. During 1944\u201345, the squadron supported the Allied advance into Germany and it remained there until mid-1946 as part of the occupation force following the end of hostilities. In the post war years, the squadron was disbanded and re-formed several times, operating a variety of jet aircraft in the fighter, reconnaissance and interceptor roles. In 2006, the squadron was re-roled as the Fast Jet & Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit. It remained in this role until 2010 when it became the RAF's Test and Evaluation Squadron.\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War, 1916\u20131919===\nNo. 41 Squadron [[Royal Flying Corps]] was originally formed at Fort Rowner, RAF Gosport, in mid April 1916 with a nucleus of men from [[No. 28 Squadron RAF|28 Squadron RFC]]. However, on 22 May 1916, the squadron was disbanded again when it was re-numbered \"27 Reserve Squadron RFC\".<ref name=\"RAF 1919\">Operations Record Book for 41 Squadron RFC/RAF, Oct 1916 \u2013 Jan 1919, TNA AIR 1/1791/204/153/1-4 & 1/1792/204/153/5-6, 8 & 10</ref>\n\n41 Squadron was re-formed on 14 July 1916<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" /> with a nucleus of men from 27 Reserve Squadron, and equipped with the [[Vickers F.B.5]] 'Gun Bus' and [[Airco DH.2|Airco D.H.2]] [[Scout (aircraft)|'Scout']]. These were replaced in early September 1916 with the [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.8]], and it was these aircraft which the squadron took on their deployment to [[Western Front (World War I)|France]] on 15 October 1916. Eighteen aircraft departed Gosport for the 225-mile flight to St. Omer, but only 12 actually made it, the others landing elsewhere with technical problems. The 12 pilots spent a week at St. Omer before moving to Abeele, where the ground crews reached them by road, and the remaining six pilots by rail, minus their aircraft.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">History of 41 Squadron, R.A.F., 1916\u20131927; TNA AIR 1/692/21/20/41</ref>\n\nThe F.E.8 was already obsolete as a pure fighter, and No. 41 used theirs mainly for [[Close air support|ground attack]]. On 24 January 1917, the squadron claimed its first victories. These fell to Sgt Plt Cecil Tooms, who himself was killed in action only four hours later.<ref name=\"RAF 1919\"/> While equipped with F.E.8s, the squadron participated in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (April\u2013May 1917) and the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] (June 1917). By this time the unit had become the last [[pusher configuration|\"pusher\"]] fighter squadron in the RFC. In July 1917 No. 41 were re-equipped with [[Airco DH 5|DH 5]] fighters, which proved disappointing; in October 1917  the squadron finally received [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5a]] fighters, with which they were equipped for the duration of the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe squadron provided distinguished service in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (November 1917), and subsequently in the German [[Spring Offensive]] (March 1918), and the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] (August 1918). 41 Squadron claimed its final victory of the war two days prior to the cessation of hostilities.<ref name=\"RAF 1919\"/> In the aftermath, the unit was reduced to a cadre of just 16 men on 7 February 1919 and returned to the United Kingdom. Their new base was [[Tangmere]], but they were moved to Croydon, Surrey, in early October and formally disbanded on 31 December 1919.<ref name=\"RAF 1919\"/>\n\nDuring the war, some seventeen [[Flying ace|ace]]s served with No. 41 Squadron, including; [[William Gordon Claxton]], [[Frederick McCall]], [[William Ernest Shields]], [[Eric John Stephens]], [[Frank Soden]], [[Russell Winnicott]], [[Geoffrey Hilton Bowman]], [[Roy W. Chappell]], [[Alfred Hemming]], [[Frank Harold Taylor]], [[Malcolm MacLeod (aviator)|Malcolm MacLeod]], [[Loudoun MacLean]], future [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Meredith Thomas]], and [[William John Gillespie (aviator)|William Gillespie]]. The unit had a remarkable number of Canadian aces in it\u2014ten out of the seventeen. The squadron's pilots and ground crews were awarded four [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], six [[Military Cross|MCs]], nine [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFCs]], two [[Military Medal|MMs]] and four [[Mentioned in dispatches|Mentions in Dispatches]] for their World War I service with the unit. The pilots were credited with destroying 111 aircraft and 14 balloons, sending down 112 aircraft out of control, and driving down 25 aircraft and five balloons. Thirty-nine men were killed or died on active service, 48 were wounded or injured, and 20 pilots became Prisoners of War.<ref>Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Operations Record Book for 41 Squadron RFC/RAF, Oct 1916 \u2013 Jan 1919, TNA AIR 1/1791/204/153/1-4 & 1/1792/204/153/5-6, 8 & 10, Recording Officer\u2019s Diary, 41 Squadron RAF, 9 Oct. 1916 \u2013 30 May 1917; TNA AIR 1/1791/204/153/11, and Record of Enemy Aircraft Brought Down, Jan. 1917-Nov. 1918, 41 Squadron RAF, TNA AIR 1/1792/204/153/16</ref>\n\n===Between the wars, 1923\u20131939===\n[[File:Armstrong-Whitworth Siskin ExCC.jpg|thumb|left|RAF Armstrong-Whitworth Siskin IIIa from No. 41 Squadron at Northolt being serviced with oxygen.]]\nThe squadron reformed at [[RAF Northolt]] on 1 April 1923, equipped with the [[Sopwith Snipe]].

At the end of May 1940, the squadron flew south to [[RAF Hornchurch]] to participate in the [[evacuation of Dunkirk]]. Twelve days later, they returned to RAF Catterick, claiming six Axis aircraft destroyed and one probable, but also left behind two pilots, the squadron's first pilot killed in action and their first lost as a prisoner of war.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Dunkirk\" /> After resting for a few weeks, the squadron headed south again on 26 July 1940, to participate in the first phase of the [[Battle of Britain]]. In its two-week tour, the Squadron claimed 10 Axis aircraft destroyed, four probables and three damaged, for the loss of one pilot killed and a second wounded.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAgain, 41 Squadron returned north to Catterick for a few weeks rest, but returned to Hornchurch on 3 September 1940, where they remained until the end of February 1941. They were now in the thick of the Battle of Britain. The price was high, but so was the damage they inflicted on the [[Luftwaffe]]. On 5 September, the squadron experienced one of its blackest days. The Commanding Officer and OC, B Flight, were killed in action and three other pilots were shot down and two were wounded in action; one of these was hospitalised for six months.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1940, the Battle of Britain was considered officially over. 49 pilots flew with the squadron between 10 July and 31 October 1940. Of these, 42 were British, 2 Canadian, 2 Irish and 2 New Zealanders. 10 were killed and 12 wounded in action (44% casualties). The squadron claimed over 100 victories from July 1940 to the end of that year.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/424, Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and Brew (2014), pp 281\u2013285.</ref>\n[[File:Spitfire IIA P7666.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sqn Ldr Donald O.

Only four pilots remained from the original 18 who landed in Hornchurch on 3 September 1940. However, in reality it is much worse: 16 pilots had been killed, five wounded and hospitalised (who did not return) and 15 otherwise posted away, in effect a 200% turnover since the unit's deployment to Hornchurch in early September. The squadron also now has its third Commanding Officer since then, and its fourth within ten months.<ref>Brew (2014), p. 357.</ref>\n\nFollowing five months rest in Catterick, during which the last Battle of Britain hardened pilots departed and new recruits joined from the [[BCATP|British Commonwealth Air Training Program]], the squadron headed south to Merston, [[Sussex]], on 28 July 1941, to join the Tangmere Wing, where the [[wing leader]] was [[Douglas Bader]]. There followed an intensive period of offensive activity over France.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425, and Brew (2014), p. 430.</ref>\n\nOn 12 February 1942, 41 Squadron took part in the attack on the German Kriegsmarine's {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} after they escaped from Brest and made a dash up the Channel to the safety of their home ports.

The pilots returned from the third without the Officer Commanding, Sqn Ldr Geoffrey Hyde, who was hit by Flak and killed; he was the squadron's only casualty that day.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425, and Brew (2012), pp. 23\u201339.</ref>\n\nTired, after a busy summer on the south coast fending off Me109s and FW190s fulfilling the Luftwaffe's \"hit and run\" strategy, the squadron was taken off operations until February 1943 and sent to [[Llanbedr]], [[Wales]], for an extended period of rest. This heralded the start of an intensive period of turnover in the unit's ranks as men were rested and fresh pilots brought in.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425.</ref>\n\nIn February 1943, the unit became the first of only two squadrons to receive the new [[Supermarine Spitfire (Griffon-powered variants)|Griffon-engine Spitfire]] Mark XII. Having rested, re-equipped and trained on the new aircraft, the squadron was sent back onto operations in April 1943, and claimed their first definitive victory in over ten months on 17 April. This was also the first by the RAF in the Mk. XII Spitfire.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/425</ref>\n\n[[File:Supermarine Spitfire F Mk XIIs of 41 Sqn.jpg|thumbnail|right|41 Squadron Spitfire XIIs in an Air Ministry photograph dated 12 April 1944.

On D-Day itself, 6 June 1944, three pilots were hit by Flak over the bridgehead and one was killed. On 19 June, however, the squadron was pulled off air support for the bridgehead in France and was deployed solely in the destruction of Germany's newest weapon, the [[V-1 flying bomb]].<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/426, and Brew (2012), Chapter 6.</ref> On 28 August 1944, the squadron claimed its last of 53 V1s destroyed during the war. Several pilots succeeded in bringing them down after expending all their ammunition, by flying alongside them and placing their own wingtips underneath that of the V1. The wind movement between both wingtips was sufficient to upset the V1's gyroscope and send crashing it to the ground.<ref>Brew (2012), p. 498.</ref>\n\nThe squadron was re-equipped with the Spitfire XIV in September 1944 and during the ensuing three months participated in 'Big Ben' operations against V2 launch sites, in [[Operation Market Garden]] at [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]], in operations in the [[Walcheren]] campaign, and in the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Allied Oil Campaign]] over [[Germany]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/426.</ref>\n\nThe squadron moved to the continent in early December 1944, making its base at [[Diest]] in Belgium. Ground targets were the squadron's chief prey as a member of 125 Wing, and the unit attacked anything moving on road, rail or canal in [[Germany]]. Operating so close to the ground, Flak also took its toll on pilots and aircraft. One pilot was killed, three wounded and two shot down and taken prisoner.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn April 1945, the squadron moved forward with the advancing front and made its first base in Germany, just southwest of the town of [[Celle]], 140 miles (225&nbsp;km) due west of [[Berlin]], and only a short distance southeast of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]]. During April and early May 1945, German resistance crumbled. 41 Squadron claimed 33 enemy aircraft destroyed, two probably destroyed and three damaged in the air and 21 damaged on the ground, in the 23 days preceding 3 May 1945 (the date of the squadron's final claim). Their own casualties for the same period were no pilots killed or wounded in action, and no aircraft lost to enemy action, although some did sustain combat damage.<ref>41 Squadron Operations Record Book, TNA AIR 27/426, and Brew (2012), Chapter 10.</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft of the Royal Air Force, 1939-1945- Supermarine Spitfire.

In April 1951 these were replaced by the [[Gloster Meteor|Gloster Meteor F.8]], and four years later the squadron received the [[Hawker Hunter]] F.5.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" /> On 14 July 1957, the squadron was presented with a Standard displaying the unit's Battle Honours by the CAS, Air Marshal Sir [[Theodore McEvoy]] KCB CBE, who had served three years with 41 Squadron as a young officer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/McEvoy.htm|title=Air Chief Marshal Sir Theodore McEvoy (16181)|last=|first=|date=|website=Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> following his graduation from [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|RAF College, Cranwell]] in 1925.<ref>The Times, 13 May & 5 July 1957</ref>\n\nHowever, no amount of nostalgia would save the unit from the Government's budgetary axe. On 15 January 1958, as a part of a scheme to reduce the size of [[RAF Fighter Command]], 41 Squadron fell to the same fate as [[No. 600 Squadron RAF|600]] and [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadron]]s had before it, and were also disbanded. With the departure of 41 Squadron from RAF Biggin Hill ceased to be a Fighter Command airfield, its infrastructure now deemed out of date for the requirements of modern warfare. The runways had become too short for the RAF's newest generation of aircraft and, as a result of encroaching development and civil air paths which now passed above, the base was no longer in a practical location. Fighter Command officially departed from the airfield on 1 March 1958.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://bigginhill.co.uk/rafstation.htm|title=Royal Air Force Station Biggin Hill|last=|first=|date=|website=Biggin Hill Web Site|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThis gave 41 Squadron the curious distinction of being the last fighter squadron ever to be based at Biggin Hill. The departure of the unit marked the end of an era for the Station in every sense of the word, as thereafter it was relegated to non-operational status and only used by the London [[University Air Squadron]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:41 Sqn Jaguar 01APR06.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Jaguar of outgoing Officer Commanding 41 Squadron, Wg Cdr R.

On 16 January 1958, just a day after being disbanded, [[No. 141 Squadron RAF|141 Squadron]], based at [[RAF Coltishall]], near Norwich in Norfolk, dropped the '1' at the beginning of its number and was thus reborn as 41 Squadron. In doing so, they automatically absorbed 141's all-weather [[Gloster Javelin]] FAW.4 fighters and personnel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.airsceneuk.org.uk/wattisham/424-41sq/41sq.htm|title=41 Squadron: Seek and Destroy|last=Parsons|first=Gary|date=|website=Air-Scene UK|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\n41 Squadron's standard, originally presented only six months previously, was handed over to 141 Squadron on 16 January 1958 in a short ceremony attended by Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Thomas Pike]], and by 11 Group's Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal Victor Bowling, himself a veteran 41 Squadron pilot from 1935.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Bowling_VS.htm|title=Air Vice-Marshal V S Bowling (24197)|last=|first=|date=|website=Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nOnly remaining at Coltishall six months, the squadron moved to [[RAF Wattisham]], near Ipswich, Suffolk, on 5 July 1958, where the [[Gloster Javelin]] FAW.4s were replaced by FAW.8s in January 1960. By this time, [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56 Squadron]] had also joined them at the station. Whilst there, they hosted [[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Super Myst\u00e8re]] fighters during President [[Charles de Gaulle]]\u2019s state visit in April 1960. 41 Squadron called Wattisham home for approximately five-and-a-half years, before the unit was disbanded again, on 31 December 1963.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nOn 1 September 1965, after a 20-month break, 41 Squadron was re-formed at [[RAF West Raynham]], near Fakenham in Norfolk, but this time as a completely different structure. The unit remained firmly on the ground as a missile defence squadron, armed with [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bloodhound Mk. II]] surface-to-air-missile (SAM). Changes to the SAM programme, however, saw 41 Squadron disbanded yet again just five years later, on 18 September 1970.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" /> The squadron standard was moved to the Church of St. Michael and St. George at RAF West Raynham, for safe-keeping.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\"/>\n\nOn 1 April 1972, at [[RAF Coningsby]] in Lincolnshire, the squadron was reborn as a tactical fighter reconnaissance and ground attack unit within [[No. 38 Group RAF|38 Group]] Air Support Command. To support them in their reconnaissance role, a \"Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre\" or \"RIC\" was formed. The RIC is composed of a number of Air Transportable Reconnaissance Exploitation Laboratories which enable the developing of images and their subsequent analysis. The ATRELs can be transported by air or road and can be deployed with the squadron to forward operating bases.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\"/>\n[[File:41 Sqn Tornado & Harrier Flypast Oct06.jpg|thumbnail|right|A flypast of a 41 Squadron Tornado and three 41 Squadron Harriers, RAF Coningsby, October 2006.]]\nIn this role, they were equipped with [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in UK service|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom FGR.2s]] but these were soon deemed to be unsuitable for the unit. Over the ensuing years, a strategic decision was made to change the role of the RAF's Phantoms from a fighter to an interceptor. This amendment, however, created consternation within some circles as it was felt the squadron should maintain its role as a fighter and ground attack unit. Consequently, it was resolved to disband 41 Squadron and re-form it elsewhere to enable it to do so.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nIn preparation for this change, \"41 Designate Squadron\" was formed at RAF Coltishall, in Norfolk, on 1 July 1976 and commenced training as a reconnaissance unit with [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] GR.1 aircraft. The two squadrons operated independently of one another until 31 March 1977 when 41 Squadron was disbanded at Coningsby. This allowed 41 Designate Squadron to drop 'Designate' from their name, take possession of the standard, adopt the squadron badge, and become the new combat-ready 41 Squadron at RAF Coltishall a day later.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n[[File:41 Sqn Jaguar XZ103 01APR06.jpg|thumbnail|left|41 Squadron Jaguar XZ103 Tailfin, RAF Coltishall, 1 April 2006.]]\n41 Squadron's role changed to low-level reconnaissance and, in early 1978, it became part of [[SACEUR]]\u2019s Strategic Reserve. In 1980, the unit was assigned to the [[Allied Command Europe Mobile Force]] and was subsequently involved in exercises at [[Bardufoss Airport|Bardufoss]] in Norway and in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.targetlock.org.uk/jaguar/service_uk.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113238/http://www.targetlock.org.uk/jaguar/service_uk.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn support of its reconnaissance role, the unit formed a RIC at Coltishall to process and interpret the photographs made by pilots, using sensors located in a large external pod. The film was taken to the MAREL's (Mobile Aerial Reconnaissance Exploitation Laboratories) for processing and interpretation. Ideally, a mission report would have been generated within 45 minutes of 'engines off'. Smaller \"air-portable\" RICs were also used during off-base deployments.<ref>http://www.ctlopez.com/story/?story=20011026_3847</ref>\n\nAs a result of this ability, the squadron has been involved in a number of conflicts over the past two decades. In early 1991, during the First Gulf War ([[Operation Granby]], but more widely known by its American name, \"[[Desert Storm]]\"), a large number of reconnaissance and bombing missions were flown against Iraqi forces with [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguar GR.1A]] aircraft as a part of the coalition forces.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nIn its aftermath, the squadron was deployed to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], in southwest Turkey, where it participated in the defence of Iraq's Kurdish minority within the boundaries of the country's northern no-fly zone (Operations \"Warden\" and \"Resinate North\") until April 1993. It was during this period that the large external photographic pods were replaced with smaller, more versatile, medium level pods.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFour months later, the squadron was deployed to southern Italy, where it flew policing duties over Bosnia in support of [[Operation Deny Flight]] until August 1995. It was during this time that one of the unit's Jaguars became the first RAF aircraft to drop a bomb in anger over Europe since the end of World War II. The target was a Bosnian Serb tank.<ref name=\"raf.mod.uk\" />\n\nThe squadron returned to Coltishall in August 1995 for a well-earned rest. Despite the vital work they had performed in Iraq and Bosnia, however, the squadron found their photographic systems were inhibited by the use of photographic film, which required special handling and processing before any results could be viewed and analysed. This drawback was compounded by the inherent difficulties of moving hardcopy prints around the battlefield, particularly with the distances involved in modern warfare. To overcome these issues, the Jaguar Replacement Reconnaissance Pod (JRRP) was introduced in August 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airrecce.co.uk/postww2/ac/Jaguar/Jaguar.html|title=Sepecat Jaguar Recce Pod, 601GP(1), DJRP|last=|first=|date=|website=www.airrecce.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThe new system provided for the recording of a digital images by three cameras onto VHS-C super videotapes with electro optical sensors for day operations and infra-red sensors for night operations. Digital images were then analysed in the ATRELs through in a windows-based application, named \u2018Ground Imagery Exploitation System\u2019, or \"GIES\".

A White Paper, titled \"Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities\", foresaw the retirement of the RAF's Jaguar aircraft two years early and the closure of RAF Coltishall. Advances in technology, it reasoned, would mean air defence could be maintained with fewer aircraft, thus allowing older equipment to be withdrawn from service earlier than originally intended. The authors planned that the RAF's future air combat force would be based around the multi-role Typhoon and Joint Combat Aircraft, in co-operation with the [[Panavia Tornado IDS|Tornado GR4]] and [[BAe Harrier|Harrier GR7/GR9]]. Furthermore, the paper intended to reduce RAF trained strength from 48,500 to 41,000 by 1 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/147C7A19-8554-4DAE-9F88-6FBAD2D973F9/0/cm6269_future_capabilities.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802083938/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/147C7A19-8554-4DAE-9F88-6FBAD2D973F9/0/cm6269_future_capabilities.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-08-02|title=Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities|page=9}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of these decisions, every one of RAF Coltishall's units would be directly affected.

[[No. 6 Squadron RAF|6 Squadron]], with the last of the RAF's Jaguars, would be moved to RAF Coningsby on 1 April 2006 and disbanded by 31 October 2007.

However, their disbandment had little immediate effect on the activity at Coltishall as most airframes and personnel were absorbed into 6 and 41 Squadrons. However, with the departure of these latter squadrons in 2006, and the subsequent closure of the base in December, the close-knit RAF community was dispersed to other locations, and a quiet returned to the area, which has not existed since May 1940.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiritofcoltishall.com/history|title=Royal Air Force Coltishall|last=|first=|date=|website=Spirit of Coltishall Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite the Government's intention to disband 41 Squadron, and plans drawn up for final ceremonies to take place on the first weekend in April 2006, the unit was given a new lease on life only a short while before taking effect.

He left the RAF in 1922 to work for Vickers-Armstrong. In 1934, however, he formed the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company with his colleague James Martin, to design new aircraft and offer flying lessons. One of their more notable pupils was Amy Johnson. The company went on to manufacture and market four different propeller aircraft, but Baker himself was killed in a flying accident in 1942, whilst test-flying the third of these. It was his death, however, that caused his business partner to rethink safety and develop a means of assisted escape for pilots. As a result, Martin-Baker began to manufacture ejection seats in 1946, and still does today for both fixed wing and rotary military aircraft. Amongst 80 types of aircraft into which their seats have been fitted are the Jaguar, which 41 Squadron flew from 1977\u20132006, the Harrier, which the squadron flew from 2006\u20132010, and the Tornado and Typhoon, both of which they fly today. Martin-Baker ejection seats are now being fitted into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Over 70,000 Martin-Baker ejection seats have been delivered to 93 air forces, which have saved almost 7,500 lives. It is a squadron legacy that in giving his own life, Baker has saved the lives of thousands of others.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Valentine Henry Baker funeral brochure | publisher=Martin-Baker Co. | year=1942 | url=http://www.rainydaygallery.co.uk/valentinebaker.html}}</ref>\n* American Lieutenant [[Eugene Hoy Barksdale|Eugene Barksdale]] served with 41 Squadron from July\u2013October 1918, during which time he claimed two victories and was wounded in action. In October 1918, he transferred to the American Expeditionary Force and returned home to become as USAAF test pilot. Clearly a talented pilot in this early era of flight, he is perhaps best known for having flown an Airco DH-4 light bomber from McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, to Mitchel Field, which became Mitchel AFB in New York, a distance of some 600 miles solely on instruments. However, in August 1926, whilst testing a Douglas O-2 observation aircraft for spin characteristics over McCook Field, he was unable to recover the aircraft and was killed. Buried with full military honours at Arlington National Cemetery, the USAF's [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] near [[Bossier City, Louisiana]], was named in his honour when opened in February 1933. The base is currently home to five squadrons of B52 Stratofortresses. Barksdale Street, on Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts, is also named after him.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://secure.afa.org/joinafa/afmag2017/afmag1017/mobile/index.html#p=115 |journal=Air Force |title=Barksdale: This life, this death |date=October 2017 |page=112}}</ref>\n* Canadian Squadron Leader [[Frederick McCall|Frederick R. G. McCall]] served on 41 Squadron from May to August 1918, in that time claiming 31 victories, which were in addition to a previous four claimed on 13 Sqn. His achievements on 41 were recognised with the award of a DSO and a DFC. Following the war, McCall was employed in civil aviation, and subsequently served at home as a Squadron Leader in the RCAF during World War II. He died in 1949, aged just 53, but by that time had dedicated over 30 years of his life to flying. In recognition of his service to Canadian aviation, a new airfield in Calgary was named McCall Field in his honour. That airfield is today [[Calgary International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/mccall.htm|title=Frederick McCall|publisher= First World War|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Having claimed 60 aerial victories during the First World War, Canadian Air Vice-Marshal [[Raymond Collishaw]] is considered the third-highest-scoring Allied pilot of the entire War. By his arrival on 41 Squadron in 1923 as its second peacetime Officer Commanding, he had been awarded no less than 2 DSOs, a military OBE, a DSC, a DFC, 3 MiDs, the French Croix de Guerre, and the three White Russian Orders of St. Stanislas, St. Anne, and St. Vladimir. Along with his significant victory tally, he was very much a legend in his own time. Collishaw retired in October 1943 and spent the rest of the war as a Regional Air Liaison Officer for Civil Defence UK. By the time he returned to his native Canada in 1946, he had also been awarded a CB and a civil OBE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constable.ca/caah/colishaw.htm |title=Raymond Collishaw World War I Fighter Ace: A Short History |last=Constable |first=Miles |website=Canadian Air Aces and Heroes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101443/http://www.constable.ca/caah/colishaw.htm |archivedate=6 April 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref>\n* Having graduated Sandhurst in 1915, Air Commodore [[Patrick Huskinson]] was seconded to the RFC later that same year, and served on 2, 4, and 19 Squadrons before the cessation of hostilities. He was credited with 11 victories, and awarded two Military Crosses. Following the war, he commanded 204 and 70 Squadrons, and then spent four years in instructing roles at Cranwell. For the following 11 years from the mid-1920s, he fulfilled armament and ordinance roles in the United Kingdom and Middle East, with the exception of a 20-month period between February 1930 and October 1931 when he commanded 41 Squadron. Returning to ordinance in March 1938, he became vice president of the Ordnance Committee at Woolwich Arsenal and then the Director of Armament Development with the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1940, reporting to [[Lord Beaverbrook]]. In April 1941, however, Huskinson and his wife were seriously injured by Luftwaffe night-time bombing in the Blitz and Huskinson was blinded. Following nine months\u2019 convalescence, he was retired as an Air Commodore in January 1942. However, he immediately became the president of the Air Armament Board, which post he held until 1945. In this role, he was involved in the development of large bunker-busting bombs, such as the [[Tallboy bomb|Tall Boy]], and in several other technologies, despite his handicap. In 1945, he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] and the U.S. Legion of Merit for his work in this role. Huskinson also wrote an autobiography in 1949 called 'Vision Ahead', which explains his career in some detail. He also recalls his \"very happy years in charge of Number 41 Squadron\". It was also Huskinson who wrote to the Mayor of St. Omer and obtained permission for 41 Squadron to use part of the Town Arms in its badge.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Huskinson.htm |title=Air Commodore P.

Wheeler]] CBE was granted a Short Service Commission in 1924, and served on 41 Squadron as a Flight Commander from September 1933 to August 1936. During this time, he was deployed to Aden with the squadron, arriving there six weeks ahead of the main group and aircraft, as a member of the advance party. From 1940 to 1944, Wheeler's postings related to experimental aircraft and aircraft development, both with the Performance Testing Squadron at [[Boscombe Down]] and the Aircraft & Armament Experimental Establishment at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]], for which he was mentioned in dispatches. Between February and October 1944, Wheeler was Station Commander at RAF [[Fairford]] where he was involved in glider deployment for D-Day operations and the Arnhem landings. His contribution was recognised with the award of an OBE in the 1945 New Year's Honours. Following further postings, including to Asia and the Mediterranean, Wheeler returned to the Aircraft & Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe as it Commandant. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] whilst there and retired in May 1955. Wheeler was subsequently employed as an aviation consultant and technical advisor to the film industry, and worked on such films as 'The Blue Max' and 'Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines', and was even used as a pilot in the latter movie.<ref>\"Air Commodore Allen Wheeler.\" Times [London, England] 5 January 1984: 12.

He served as 41 Squadron's Intelligence Officer for over five years of the War, and reported the squadron's activity, victories and losses up the chain of command on a daily basis. He refused further promotion.<ref>Obituary: Thomas Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough, The Times 2 March 1951; Issue 51939</ref>\n* Squadron Leader [[George Bennions]] was posted to 41 Squadron in February 1936. It was here that he remained for the ensuing almost five years, and he was commissioned on the Sqn in April 1940. Bennions proved to be quite a talented pilot, and he claimed his first victory over the Channel in July 1940, during the earliest salvoes of the [[Battle of Britain]]. Over the months of August and September, Bennions\u2019 tally continued to rise to the point where he had claimed ten and one shared destroyed, seven probably destroyed, and five damaged, making him the second most successful pilot on 41 Squadron during World War II. Aside from his significant victory tally during the Battle of Britain, Bennions is of interest for one of those victories, which took place on 5 September 1940. Contemporary researchers credit him with a shared victory over Oblt [[Franz von Werra]], the Group Adjutant of JG3, who was flying an Me109E. Von Werra's aircraft is believed to have been damaged by Bennions but finished off by 603 Squadron's [[Gerald Stapleton|Plt Off Basil Stapleton]], forcing the German pilot to crash-land near Marden, Kent. Von Werra was captured unhurt and sent to Canada, as were the majority of German POWs, to hinder their chances of escape. However, von Werra nonetheless succeeded in escaping, and returned to Germany in April 1941. So unusual was this feat that he was the only German POW to succeed in doing so during the War. Von Werra's story was the subject of a book, and also of a film entitled 'The One That Got Away', which was released in 1957 and starred Hardy Kr\u00fcger as von Werra.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454022/Squadron-Leader-Ben-Bennions.html |title=Obituary \u2013 Squadron Leader 'Ben' Bennions|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=12 February 2004|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric.S.Lock.jpg|thumbnail|right|Flt Lt Eric S. Lock, July 1941]]\n* Pilot Officer [[Eric Lock]] joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in February 1939 and was posted to 41 Squadron as his first operational unit, in mid-June 1940. Lock's first operational sortie took place on 9 August 1940, which was uneventful, as was his second a few days later. However, between 15 August and 17 November 1940, Lock claimed no less than 22 aircraft destroyed, and he became the most successful RAF pilot of the Battle of Britain and the equal second highest-scoring pilot in the RAF at the time. Over the three consecutive months of September, October and November 1940, Lock was awarded a DFC, a Bar, and a DSO. On the afternoon of 5 September 1940, 41 Squadron's most intensive day of the [[Battle of Britain]], Lock claimed three victories in a single sortie. The aircraft he flew that day, Spitfire Ia, N3162, EB-G, is recognised by 41 Squadron, which has the letters EB-G on one of their Typhoons, and by the BBMF, which has EB-G emblazoned on their Spitfire P7350. Lock was seriously wounded in action on 17 November 1940, and underwent multiple operations, which included three skin grafts at the hands of Dr. [[Archibald McIndoe]] at [[East Grinstead]]. Following seven months\u2019 recuperation, he returned to operations with 611 Squadron in late June 1941. During July 1941, he added another three victories to his already impressive list, but on 3 August, he failed to return from a routine operation after attacking a German column on a road behind Boulogne. In recognition of his achievements and status in Battle of Britain history, he is remembered on several memorials and in his hometown of [[Bayston Hill]], outside Shrewsbury, where a street is named after him. He remains today one of the RAF's top ten Aces of World War II, credited with some 25 aircraft destroyed and 7 probably destroyed, all bar three of which he achieved on 41 Squadron.<ref>Shores, Christopher (1983).

In July 1944, by now OC, 602 Squadron, Le Roux was credited with attacking and seriously injuring General [[Erwin Rommel]] in his staff car, on a road outside Sainte Foy de Montgomerie, in Normandy. Strafing the vehicle, the driver lost control, struck a tree and spun off the road. Rommel fractured his skull when he was thrown from the vehicle. In doing so, Le Roux single-handedly removed Germany's commanding general from the Normandy battlefield.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol014dt.html | title=South African Air Aces of World War II | author=Tidy, D | date= June 1969 | volume=1 | issue=4}}</ref>\n* Dutch Flight Lieutenant [[Bram van der Stok]] was posted to 41 Squadron as a Fg Off in December 1941. Promoted to Actg Flt Lt and appointed OC A Flight in March 1942, he quickly claimed two victories, but was shot down over France the following month. Taken into immediate captivity, he was sent to [[Stalag Luft III]], Sagan, where he remained until March 1944 when he took part in the mass escape of airmen that we know today as [[Stalag Luft III escape|The Great Escape]]. All but three of the escapees were recaptured and fifty of them were executed as retribution on Hitler's orders. Of the three that successfully made their escapes, van der Stok was one. Acting as a Dutch labourer on forged papers, he made it back the United Kingdom in early July 1944, travelling on a route, which took him through the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain and Gibraltar. In 1963, [[United Artists]] released the film, 'The Great Escape', based upon a book of the same name, written by Australian author [[Paul Brickhill]] in 1950. In the movie, a character broadly based on van der Stok was played by [[James Coburn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5648616/Bram-van-der-Stok.html|work=[[the Daily Telegraph]]|title=Obituary: Bram van der Stok|date=1 July 1993|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Canadian Sergeant Pilot [[George Beurling|George F. Beurling]] was posted to 41 Squadron in April 1942, but proved too head-strong, fought with other members of the unit, and gained a reputation for doing his own thing in the air and not remaining in formation or following orders. By the following month, he was requesting a transfer to Malta and it was granted. Nonetheless, in his brief time with 41 Squadron, he claimed his first two victories. In time, he became Canada's leading World War II ace, and was credited with 31 victories between May 1942 and December 1943. As a result, he was awarded a DSO, a DFC and two DFMs. However, he was 'retired' early from the RCAF in 1944 as his skill in cockpit was matched by streak of rebelliousness, and disrespect for authority. He had a reputation for ignoring team tactics and breaking formation to attack the enemy alone and had gained two nicknames, 'Buzz Beurling' and the not-so-complimentary 'Screwball Beurling'.<ref>[http://www.acesofww2.com/Canada/aces/beurling/ \"George Frederick \"Screwball\" Beurling.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615051531/http://www.acesofww2.com/Canada/aces/beurling/ |date=15 June 2013 }} ''acesofww2.com'.

He fled Russia with his parents and siblings in the wake of the October Revolution in 1917, and settled in England, where he was educated. Galitzine joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve on a Short Service Commission in late 1938, but left again to go to Finland in early 1940 to fight the Soviets attempting to occupy the country. Returning to London again in October 1940, after his mother was killed in the Blitz, Galitzine rejoined the RAFVR, but had to do so as an aircraftsman, though he was recommissioned in September 1941. Galitzine saw operational service in several squadrons before joining 41 Squadron as a Fg Off in May 1943, and he claimed a probably destroyed enemy aircraft with the unit in October. Following his tenure with the squadron, he was rested as personal assistant to Air Vice-Marshal Sir William Dickson, then commanding 83 Group, which was preparing for the Normandy invasion. When Dickson was posted to Italy, Galitzine accompanied him, adding Italian to an already impressive list of languages he spoke. Following the War, Galitzine worked in the civil aviation industry, but maintained links with Russia and, in 1998, attended the reburial and funeral service of the murdered Tsar and his family in St Petersburg.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1418277/Prince-Emanuel-Galitzine.html|title=Prince Emanuel Galitzine|date=9 January 2003|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Flying Officer Peter Gibbs was a generally unassuming character who served with 41 Squadron between January 1944 and March 1945. He was an active pilot during his tour and an avid musician. He became a professional musician after he left the RAF in August 1945 and joined the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1954. Within two years, he had joined the London Symphony Orchestra and during this time became (in)famous for a dressing down he gave to one of the Century's most celebrated performing artists, Herbert von Karajan. The orchestra felt von Karajan had been unprofessional when conducting smaller, \u2018less important\u2019 concerts during a tour of the United States in 1956. He had often just bowed once and left the stage at the end of concerts, refusing to return for encores, despite the applause from the audience. The orchestra was slighted by this behaviour, and eventually had had enough. The last straw came when von Karajan left the stage in Boston after the last note was played, neither waiting for applause nor calls for an encore. The orchestra, in which Gibbs was playing first violin, was upset by this apparent insult to both them and the audience, but turned up nonetheless on time for an early rehearsal the following morning. Von Karajan, however, came in late, much to the disgruntlement of the orchestra. When he finally arrived, Peter Gibbs, an impromptu, self-appointed spokesman, stood up and addressed him directly, demanding an apology. He rebuked von Karajan, stating, \"I did not spend four years of my life fighting bastards like you to be insulted before our own allies as you did last evening.\" Von Karajan ignored him completely and continued conducting as if nothing had happened. That night, however, during a concert, von Karajan chose his moment and, during the interval, refused to go back on stage until a letter was signed stating that Gibbs be immediately sacked. The orchestra's managers had little choice but to bow to the demand. Although Gibbs was never to play with the Philharmonia again after this incident, it is understood that von Karajan also never conducted the Philharmonia again after the tour either, and it is said that he vowed to never conduct an English orchestra again. All this time, Gibbs also flew privately. He had joined the Surrey Flying Club in June 1957 and then flew more-or-less continuously for the next 18 years. Gibbs bought himself a Tiger Moth and enjoyed peacetime flying. However, flying was also what brought about his premature death in December 1975. He took off for a brief flight in a Cessna from Glenforsa Airfield on the Isle of Mull in Scotland on Christmas Eve 1975, but failed to return. A search was mounted but no trace whatsoever could be found of him. Oddly, his body was found four months after his disappearance part way up a hill, approximately one mile from Glenforsa Airfield, without his aircraft, showing the signs of having lain there all that time. The original search for Gibbs had passed through the area at the time he had gone missing, but nothing had been seen. His body gave away no clues as to his cause of death. Gibbs\u2019 missing Cessna bewildered officials and his case soon became known as the \u2018Great Mull Air Mystery\u2019. It was not until September 1986 \u2013 almost 11 years after Gibbs\u2019 death \u2013 that his aircraft was located in the sea off Oban. The aircraft's remains also gave up no clue as to the reason it was there. It can only be assumed that Gibbs, for some reason, came down in the sea and that he had managed to free himself and swim ashore. It is thought he then tried to make his way back to the airfield, around a mile away, but, considering the time of year, location, and likely temperatures of both the water and air, probably succumbed to the effects of exposure.<ref>Brew (2012), p. 671.</ref>\n\n[[File:Aharon Remez.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aharon Remez, who served as an NCO pilot with 41 Squadron in 1945, became the first Commander of the Israeli Air Force in 1948]]\n* Palestinian Sergeant Pilot [[Aharon Remez]] was posted to his first and only operational unit, 41 Squadron, in April 1945 and served with the unit until March 1946, and was not commissioned in the RAF. Based in Germany during the last weeks of the war and beyond, he witnessed Nazi atrocities first hand, and often lent a personal hand. The officers of 41 Squadron turned a blind eye, and he was given special leave to allow him to be able to do so. This enabled him to commence assisted passage for many holocaust survivors to the Middle East. Remez left the RAF in 1946 and returned home to champion the formation of a Jewish State. This occurred in May 1948, and in July he was given the post of Brigadier General and the founder and first Commanding Officer of the Israeli Air Force. He held this post until December 1950. Remez was subsequently the Head of Purchasing Delegation, Israeli MOD mission to the United States, the Israeli Defence Minister's Aide for Aviation, a member of the House Committee & Foreign Affairs & Defense Committees of the 3rd Knesset, Director of the Dept for International Co-operation in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Director General of the Israeli Ports Authority, and Chairman of the Israeli Aviation Authority.

Following training, he was posted to 26 Squadron at Gatwick in November 1942 and remained with this unit until February 1944, in that time being promoted to Flt Lt and he left the unit as a Flight Commander. Following a brief posting to 165 Squadron, Spencer was posted to 41 Squadron as OC A Flt at the beginning of May 1944. Arriving just prior to D-Day, he led the Squadron on a number of operations in advance support of the invasion, and then led the unit on anti-Diver operations from June 1944, when the V1 Doodlebug menace commenced. Within four months, he had become a V1 Ace, with seven shot down, and also claimed a destroyed German fighter, thereby ending the career of a 171-victory Luftwaffe Ace Emil 'Bully' Lang. Spencer was posted to 350 Squadron within the same Wing to take command on 4 January 1945. On 26 February, however, he was hit by Flak over Germany and captured. A month later, he escaped from camp by bicycle, and subsequently motorcycle, with another former 41 Sqn pilot, Sqn Ldr Keith 'Jimmy' Thiele, in a Steve-McQueen-style getaway, in which the pair made it back to Allied lines. Spencer returned to 350 Squadron, where he once again took over command on 2 April 1945. Only 17 days later, he was shot down once again, this time over Wismar Bay, in northern Germany. Blown out of his cockpit, the force deployed his parachute at a height of just 30\u201340 feet, which he miraculously survived, only to be captured again. The successful jump has since been credited by the Guinness Book of Records as having been the lowest authenticated survived bale-out on record. Spencer was injured and hospitalised, but liberated by advancing Allied armies approximately two weeks later. He was awarded an immediate DFC for his exploits. In 1947, he was also awarded the Territorial Efficiency Medal and the Belgian Croix de Guerre with Palm. Spencer was demobbed in December 1945 and headed to South Africa in spring 1946, taking three weeks to fly himself there in a single-engined Percival Proctor. He was employed there as the personal pilot of Ben du Preez, Managing Director of Kimlite Industries, which was a cover for illicit diamond buying. Spencer then returned to the United Kingdom where he met the actress [[Lesley Brook]], who starred in at least 24 films between 1937 and 1948. They married in August 1947 and resided for a time on the Isle of Wight, before returning to South Africa in July 1948. On this occasion, he launched a new career by founding the aerial photography company in October that same year. The company enjoyed some success, but he was to become a more successful freelance photographer for [[LIFE Magazine]], for whom he worked between September 1952 and September 1972. During his time with LIFE, he covered several conflicts, including Biafra, Congo, and the Vietnam War, and spent three months on tour with a then little-known band called [[The Beatles]]. When LIFE folded in 1972, Spencer moved to People magazine, where he spent the ensuing 20 years. He authored and published two books, the first a renowned coffee table book about The Beatles ('It was Thirty Years Ago Today'), and the second an autobiography ('Living Dangerously'), which he co-authored with his wife.

When the squadron flew to the Continent on 4 December 1944, they only landed at Evere as they were concerned about the condition of the strip at B.64 Diest. The pilots then travelled to Diest by road, where they stayed overnight, and returned to Evere the following morning to pick up their aircraft and fly them back to Diest, where they remained more or less until the end of the year.</ref> || Belgium || 4 Dec 1944\n|-\n| St. Omer || France || 14 Aug 1918 ||  || B.64 Diest/Schaffen || Belgium || 5 Dec 1944\n|-\n| Droglandt || Belgium || 20 Sep 1918 ||  || Y.32 Ophoven<ref>There is some confusion about whether 41 Squadron was based at Asch or Ophoven during this period. This probably stems from an entry in the squadron ORB on 31 December 1944, which states, \"Y.32. Asch\", however Y.32 was actually the number for Ophoven. In fact, subsequent ORB entries began to distance themselves from Asch, stating \"Y.32 Near Asch\", though all entries still state Y.32. Asch\u2019s number was Y.29 and was an American aerodrome from which fighters of the U.S. 352nd and 366th Fighter Groups operated. Royal Air Force units \u2013 namely 41, 130, 350 and 610 Squadrons \u2013 were based at nearby Y.32 Ophoven, a fact confirmed by many sources, thereunder the 125 Wing ORB.</ref> || Belgium || 31 Dec 1944\n|-\n| Halluin East || Belgium || 23 Oct 1918 ||  || B.80 Volkel || Netherlands || 27 Jan 1945\n|-\n| Tangmere || Sussex || 7 Feb 1919 ||  || Warmwell<ref>For an air-to-air and ground firing course at 17 Armament Practice Camp.</ref> || Dorset || 7 Mar 1945\n|-\n| Croydon || Surrey || 8 Oct 1919 ||  || B.78 Eindhoven || Netherlands || 18 Mar 1945\n|-\n| Northolt || Middlesex || 1 Apr 1923 ||  || B.106 Twente || Netherlands || 7 Apr 1945\n|-\n| Underway to Aden || Yemen || 4 Oct 1935 ||  || B.118 Celle || Germany || 16 Apr 1945\n|-\n| Khormaksar || Yemen || 20 Oct 1935 ||  || B.160 Kastrup || Denmark || 9 May 1945\n|-\n| Sheikh Othman || Yemen || 18 Mar 1936 ||  || B.172 Husum || Germany || 21 Jun 1945\n|-\n| Underway to Southampton || Hampshire ||  10 Aug 1936 ||  || B.158 L\u00fcbeck || Germany || 11 Jul 1945\n|-\n| Catterick || Yorkshire || 25 Sep 1936 ||  || Warmwell<ref>For a dive-bombing course at 17 Armament Practice Camp.</ref> || Dorset || 20 Aug 1945\n|-\n| Wick || Caithness || 19 Oct 1939 ||  || B.158 L\u00fcbeck || Germany || 6 Sep 1945\n|-\n| Catterick<ref>One flight and a contingent of ground crew were based at Thornaby, Yorkshire, from 23 February until 3 March 1940.

Knowles transferred to the RAF on 1 April 1918 as a Chief Mechanic and was reclassified a Flight Sergeant, Rigger Aero, on 1 January 1919. He transferred to the RAF Reserve, Class E, on 24 April 1919, and was discharged on 3 November 1922, by which time he had completed exactly eight years\u2019 service with the RFC/RAF, of which two years and three-and-a-half months were spent in France.

O\u2019Connor travelled to France with 41 Squadron\u2019s ground crew on their first deployment to the Western Front on 13 October 1916, by which time he was a Flight Sergeant and Acting Warrant Officer. Promoted to Temporary Senior Mechanic on 2 May 1917, O\u2019Connor transferred to the RAF as a Senior Mechanic on 1 April 1918 and, on 41 Squadron\u2019s reduction to Cadre and transfer home in February 1919, he was posted to 80 Wing in France. Following brief service with 20 Squadron in late February, O\u2019Connor was repatriated to England on 21 March 1919 and transferred to the Reserve, Class E, a month later.

Inspired by UK bands such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], many Italian groups had lyrics that were anti-war and anti-[[NATO]]. Groups included [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], and [[Negazione]]. The [[Last White Christmas]] festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was an important concert for Italian groups (CCM, I Refuse It!, Raw Power, Purid Fever, War Dogs). Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] \"tribute bands\" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]].\n\nIn Brazil, the hardcore scene was jump started with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around S\u00e3o Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[C\u00f3lera]] and [[Inocentes]].\n\nA [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s.

Inspired by UK bands such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], many Italian groups had lyrics that were anti-war and anti-[[NATO]]. Groups included [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], and [[Negazione]]. The [[Last White Christmas]] festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was an important concert for Italian groups (CCM, I Refuse It!, Raw Power, Purid Fever, War Dogs). Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] \"tribute bands\" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]].\n\nIn Brazil, the hardcore scene was jump started with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around S\u00e3o Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[C\u00f3lera]] and [[Inocentes]].\n\nA [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s.
