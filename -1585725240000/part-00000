In many cases the gender can vary, either because of regional differences or because the noun's gender is not firmly established.{{Sfn|Donaldson|2007|pp=33\u201337}}{{Sfn|Durrell|2017|pp=12\u201316|p=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[German articles]]\n* [[German cases]]\n* [[German nouns]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Cite book|title=German: An Essential Grammar|last=Donaldson|first=Bruce|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-36602-1|location=|pages=}}\n\n* {{Cite book|title=Hammer\u2019s German Grammar and Usage|last=Durrell|first=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-138-85371-3|edition=6th|location=}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book|title=Richtig gendern|last=Diewald|first=Gabriele|last2=Steinhauer|first2=Anja|publisher=Duden|year=2017|isbn=978-3-411-74357-5|language=German}}\n* {{Cite book|title=German All-in-One For Dummies|last=Foster|first=Wendy|last2=Christensen|first2=Paulina|last3=Fox|first3=Anne|publisher=Wiley|year=2013|isbn=978-1-118-49140-9|pages=307\u2013311}}\n\n* {{Cite book|title=Die Grammatik|last=|first=|publisher=Duden|year=2016|isbn=978-3-411-04049-0|edition=9th|location=|pages=156\u2013172|language=German}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dummies.com/languages/german/identifying-a-german-words-gender/ Identifying a German Word\u2019s Gender], ''For Dummies'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170824091422/http://www.dummies.com:80/languages/german/identifying-a-german-words-gender/ on the Internet Archive]).\n* [https://www.lsa.umich.edu/german/hmr/Grammatik/Gender/Gender.html Some Hints on How to Guess Gender], ''University of Michigan College of LSA'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180227114401/https://www.lsa.umich.edu/german/hmr/Grammatik/Gender/Gender.html on the Internet Archive]).\n[[Category:Grammatical gender]]\n[[Category:German grammar]]\n", "name_user": "DQinBLN", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNoun forms:added definition to \"das Labor\" under exceptions; alphabetized exceptions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender_in_German"}

In the opening of the game, he is stuck in bed at home with a fever. During the day he stares out of his window and sees an invisible girl in the rain who is given form by the rain casting a silhouette around her. She stares at him for a brief second before being chased away by something huge and menacing that is also invisible unless the rain gives it a form.\n\nCurious, he follows the two down an alleyway, whereupon exiting through a pair of large doors, the day suddenly turns to night and the town is now deserted, occupied only by strange invisible beasts that roam the streets. The boy also realises that he himself is invisible, and that he and the beasts are only given form by the rain.\n\nWith the way back closed, he attempts to find the girl, who is still pursued by the beasts; the one the boy saw from his window is referred to as the Unknown. Using any means to shelter from the rain, the boy evades the creatures that prowl the streets and alleyways, yet the girl proves ever elusive.\n\nAfter missing his chance to meet the girl at a church that's under renovation, the boy follows her into the grounds of a disused factory and finally makes his presence known to her. They escape together, but neither is able to hear the other's voice. Regardless, they continue on through the town while being pursued by the Unknown.\n\nAs the game progresses, the children become aware that each has a visible doppelg\u00e4nger asleep in their respective homes. The girl attempts to awaken her other self, and while doing so begins to become visible again. But before she can wake her doppelg\u00e4nger up, she is chased away by the Unknown.\n\nThe boy follows, and upon exiting her house, discovers that the town has completely restructured itself into a castle maze-type layout that is afloat on water with no end in sight. He eventually reunites with the girl and the two flee from the ever-pursuing Unknown.\n\nDrawn to a strange light at the edge of the Unknown\u2019s domain, the two arrive in an alleyway with the light seeping in through the very doors they had passed through when entering the world of the night. Exposure to the light suddenly weakens the Unknown. Seeing this the children open both doors, causing the Unknown to collapse upon the ground.\n\nHowever, they realise they cannot leave as without the rain, they have no physical form. Instead they resolve to drag the Unknown into the light beyond the door at the cost of trapping themselves in the world of night. After they close the doors, the Unknown pushes the door open as he dies and collapses onto the boy, pinning him. Unable to free him, the girl abandons him and heads straight to his home. There she yells at his window in hopes to awaken him. She succeeds, but as the boy becomes visible, the girl is left trapped and alone.\n\nAs with the beginning of the game, the ending is illustrated with [[Watercolor painting|watercolour painted stills]]. The boy awakens in his bed the next morning and immediately sets off across town, retracing his steps to the girl\u2019s home. Standing outside below her bedroom window he attempts to awaken her the way she awoke him, and the girl finally appears on her bedroom porch. The game ends with the two reuniting on the street outside the girl's house underneath a rainbow.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/27/playstation-3s-newest-art-game-rain |title=PlayStation 3\u2019s Newest Art Game: Rain |publisher=IGN |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Rain'' is an adventure game which is centred around the novel mechanic of invisibility.

They are in the [[Melanesia]] subregion and [[bioregion]] of Oceania. The archipelago forms much of the territory of [[Solomon Islands]], while the northwestern islands are within the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]], in eastern [[Papua New Guinea]]. It forms the eastern boundary of the [[Solomon Sea]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Solomon archipelago consist of over 1000 islands, ranging from low-lying [[coral atoll]]s to mountainous [[High island]]s, including many volcanoes with varying degrees of activity. [[Bougainville Island]] is the largest in the archipelago, with an area of 9,300 km2 (3591 sq miles). [[Mount Balbi]] on Bougainville is the highest peak in the archipelago at 2,715 m.\n\n===Geology===\nThe Solomon archipelago was formed by the convergence of the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]] and [[Pacific Plate]]s. The Indo-Australian Plate and the smaller [[Solomon Sea Plate]] are [[subduction|subducting]] beneath the Pacific Plate along the New Britain\u2013San Cristobal [[oceanic trench]], which runs south of and parallel to the archipelago in the [[Solomon Sea]].<ref>Holl, Heinz-Gerd.

He won the inaugural [[1965 Mr. Olympia]] competition and defended the crown at the 1966 [[Mr. Olympia]] contest before retiring.\n\n==Early life==\n'''Larry Dee Scott''' was born in [[Pocatello, Idaho]] to Thea Scott and machinist Wayne Scott.<ref name=\"sltrib.com\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57661795&itype=cmsid|title=Larry Scott, bodybuilding star to Utah and world, dies at 75|date=March 11, 2014|author=Alberty, Erin and Carlisle, Nate |work=The Salt Lake Tribune}}</ref> He began training at age 16 and won the Mr. Idaho competition in 1959 at age 20. After moving to California, he promptly won Mr. California (1960), Mr. Pacific Coast (1961), Mr. America (1962), and Mr. Universe (1964). When [[Joe Weider]] created the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]]'s [[Mr. Olympia]] title, Scott won the first two contests in 1965 and 1966. Although retiring after his 1966 Olympia win, he staged a brief comeback in 1979 before he finally retired from competition in 1980. He studied electronics at the California Air College, and was known to be a devout [[Mormon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/mrolympia2/scott.html|title=Larry Scott|work=libero.it}}</ref> He married Rachel Scott (n\u00e9e Ichikawa).<ref name=\"sltrib.com1\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57666343&itype=CMSID|title=Utah funeral scheduled for bodybuilder Larry Scott|author=Carlisle, Nate |date=March 11, 2014|work=The Salt Lake Tribune}}</ref> The Scotts had five children: daughter Susan, and sons Erin, Nathan, Derek, and Michael. Derek died in a motorcycle accident in 1992, and Michael died in 1993.<ref name=\"sltrib.com\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nHe played a minor role in the 1964 movie ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]''. When he started weight training in 1956, his narrow shoulders were a particular weak spot. He trained with [[Vince Gironda]], a well-known bodybuilder of the time, and became best known for his arm development, particularly his impressive and unusually long biceps. He attributed his biceps to an exercise called the \"Preacher Curl\", invented by Gironda, later known as the \"Scott Curl\" due to its association with Scott.\n\nScott was also a popular physique model during the early to mid-1960s, working for photographers [[Bruce Bellas|Bruce of Los Angeles]], Don Whitman (of the Western Photography Guild), and Pat Milo. Milo introduced Scott to a larger audience and helped him hone his posing and photographic persona: the \"boy next door\".
