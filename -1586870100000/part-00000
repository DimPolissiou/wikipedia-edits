Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

In recent years, boys have increasingly chosen foreign universities over Indian colleges, sometimes due to the hyper-competitiveness of the [[Higher education in India|Indian higher education system]] that calls for extremely high school-leaving scores for admissions.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/education/it-is-an-elite-school-not-elitist/article23029951.ece|title=\u2018It is an elite school, not elitist\u2019|first=Jaideep Deo|last=Bhanj|date=11 March 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\n===Traditions===\nThe early headmasters and teachers at Doon came from traditional British public schools, and the jargon introduced by them is still in use.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

It then became the 20th best-selling single of 1983 in the United Kingdom. \"I.O.U.\" was used for the 1984 [[breakdance]] [[film|movie]], ''[[Beat Street]]''. The chorus is often erroneously sung by listeners as \"A-E, A-E I-O-U, and sometimes Y\", referring to the vowels of the alphabet. It is actually \"A-E, A-E, I-O-U, U, I sometimes cry\" and \"A-E, A-E, I-O-U, U, I sometimes lie\".\n\nDuring 1986 a 12\" single was released in the US by the Criminal Records company, with new remixes. Some of these remixes were given a re-release during 1987 in the UK for the Citybeat label as \"I.O.U.

It then became the 20th best-selling single of 1983 in the United Kingdom. \"I.O.U.\" was used for the 1984 [[breakdance]] [[film|movie]], ''[[Beat Street]]''. The chorus is often erroneously sung by listeners as \"A-E, A-E I-O-U, and sometimes Y\", referring to the vowels of the alphabet. It is actually \"A-E, A-E, I-O-U, U, I sometimes cry\" and \"A-E, A-E, I-O-U, U, I sometimes lie\".\n\nDuring 1986 a 12\" single was released in the US by the Criminal Records company, with new remixes. Some of these remixes were given a re-release during 1987 in the UK for the Citybeat label as \"I.O.U. (The Ultimate Mixes '87)\", however, it only scored #23 in the UK Singles Chart this time.<ref name=chartstats87>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Want%20To%20Make%20The%20World%20Turn%20Around |title=The Official Charts Company - Freeez - IOU 1987 |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Samples==\nThe song has been sampled multiple times.

Their experiments with the manually-guided [[Spaniel (missile)|Air Spaniel]] concept had convinced them that automatic guidance of some sort was required.

In 1949, the RAE developed a watered-down specification they called \"Pink Hawk\" that called for a tail-chase attack and was intended to target piston-engined bombers.

The Pink Hawk nickname was soon replaced with the official rainbow code, \"Blue Sky\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=31}} Red Hawk continued as before only briefly before its specifications were relaxed as well; in November 1951 the Air Staff issued OR.1117, given the code \"Blue Jay\", for an [[infrared seeking]] design which became Firestreak.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=33}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=163}}\n\nFairey Aviation won the contract to develop Blue Sky, which they referred to internally as Project 5. Like the original Little Ben, Project 5 called for a beam riding missile able to be launched from the rear aspect within a 15\u00b0 cone.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=31}} Wartime German research suggested that the rocket exhaust would [[ionize]] the air behind the missile and make it difficult to receive the radar signal, so Fairey based their design on the original Red Hawk layout using separate boosters that fell away during flight, leaving the signal clear while the unpowered \"dart\" continued on to the target. In place of the original four RP-3 rockets, two custom-designed \"Stork\" rockets were used.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=32}} The two solid-fuel motors were connected to the dart about mid-way along the fuselage. The rocket nozzles were canted slightly to spin the missile assembly on launch, evening out any asymmetries in the thrust.

This also required the development of a complex multi-channel telemetry system that proved invaluable during the development of Blue Sky.{{sfn|Flight|1957|p=223}}\n\n===Testing and service===\nFireflash was given its name by the RAF as development continued.

The series was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the established BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as ''Casualty'' in the fictional city of [[Holby]], and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both ''Casualty'' (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as ''[[Casualty@Holby City]]'') and the show's 2007 [[police procedural]] spin-off ''[[HolbyBlue]]''.\n\nIts first executive producers were Young and [[Johnathan Young]], who were succeeded by [[Kathleen Hutchison]] from 2002 to 2004, [[Richard Stokes (producer)|Richard Stokes]] from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, Oliver Kent from 2013 to 2017 and Simon Harper from 2017. ''Holby City'' airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.\n\nThe show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional [[Holby City Hospital]]. It began with eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of around fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Ade Edmondson]] and [[John Michie]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmizing]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and the twenty-first began airing from 2 January 2019. The show has run for over 900 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and has featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\n''Holby City'' has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within the television and entertainment industry including [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television [[licence fee]] on the programme. The series employs a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. ''Holby City'' has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the [[British Medical Association]] denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an [[accident and emergency]] nurse at the 2008 [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.\n\n''Holby City'' [[List of awards and nominations received by Holby City|has been nominated for over 100 television awards]], of which it has won ten: the 2008 [[British Academy Television Award]] for Best Continuing Drama, one BEFFTA Award, two [[Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy|Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards]], two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four [[Screen Nation]] Awards. The show's [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] averaged 9.27&nbsp;million viewers, but apart from a rise in its [[Holby City (series 5)|fifth series]], ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] averaging 5.44&nbsp;million viewers. The [[Holby City (series 12)|twelfth series]] saw a small rise to 5.62&nbsp;million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4&nbsp;million viewers per week.\n\n==Production==\nThe show began with only eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Alex Walkinshaw]] and [[Jemma Redgrave]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the \"showrunner\" of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmising]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty complete series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and an twenty-first began airing in January 2019. The show has run for over 600 hour-long episodes. It is filmed in studios at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, with the 1960s office building Neptune House being used for multiple exteriors and interiors in the series. It has occasionally featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\nIn September 2016, as part of the broadcaster's Compete Or Compare Strategy, the BBC confirmed the show would be one of the first put up for tender.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Austin|first1=Jamie|title=BBC names first shows in new competitive tendering plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/BBC-first-shows-competitive-tendering|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=19 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027133911/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/BBC-first-shows-competitive-tendering|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the tender released in October, it was confirmed the contract, open to independent producers and [[BBC Studios]], would be for 3 series of a minimum 50 episodes per series, delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission and produced from the existing production base at [[BBC Elstree Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Invitation to Tender (ITT) |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/bbc-content-invitation-to-tender-holby-city-october-2016.pdf |website=[[BBC]] |accessdate=19 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020052444/http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/bbc-content-invitation-to-tender-holby-city-october-2016.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df= }}</ref> BBC Studios was announced as the winning bidder and will continue to produce the show through to 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC - BBC Studios awarded Holby City tender - Commissioning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/news/articles/bbc-studios-awarded-holby-city-tender-march-2017|accessdate=14 December 2017|work=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n''Holby City'' was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', which is set in the [[emergency department]] of the fictional Holby City Hospital.<ref name=\"digital spy1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holbycity/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |title='Holby City's exec producer stands down |last=Green |first=Kris |date=14 December 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=12 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r17Zw9V1?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FILM+of+the+season;+BABE,+Christmas+Day,+BBC1+7pm.-a060945126|title=Film of the season;

The series was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the established BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as ''Casualty'' in the fictional city of [[Holby]], and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both ''Casualty'' (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as ''[[Casualty@Holby City]]'') and the show's 2007 [[police procedural]] spin-off ''[[HolbyBlue]]''. \n\nIts first executive producers were Young and [[Johnathan Young]], who were succeeded by [[Kathleen Hutchison]] from 2002 to 2004, [[Richard Stokes (producer)|Richard Stokes]] from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, Oliver Kent from 2013 to 2017 and Simon Harper from 2017. ''Holby City'' airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.\n\nThe show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional [[Holby City Hospital]]. It began with eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of around fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Ade Edmondson]] and [[John Michie]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmizing]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and the twenty-first began airing from 2 January 2019. The show has run for over 900 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and has featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\n''Holby City'' has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within the television and entertainment industry including [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television [[licence fee]] on the programme. The series employs a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. ''Holby City'' has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the [[British Medical Association]] denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an [[accident and emergency]] nurse at the 2008 [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.\n\n''Holby City'' [[List of awards and nominations received by Holby City|has been nominated for over 100 television awards]], of which it has won ten: the 2008 [[British Academy Television Award]] for Best Continuing Drama, one BEFFTA Award, two [[Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy|Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards]], two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four [[Screen Nation]] Awards. The show's [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] averaged 9.27&nbsp;million viewers, but apart from a rise in its [[Holby City (series 5)|fifth series]], ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] averaging 5.44&nbsp;million viewers. The [[Holby City (series 12)|twelfth series]] saw a small rise to 5.62&nbsp;million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4 million viewers per week.\n\n==Production==\nThe show began with only eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Alex Walkinshaw]] and [[Jemma Redgrave]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the \"showrunner\" of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmising]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty complete series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and an twenty-first began airing in January 2019. The show has run for over 600 hour-long episodes. It is filmed in studios at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, with the 1960s office building Neptune House being used for multiple exteriors and interiors in the series. It has occasionally featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\nIn September 2016, as part of the broadcaster's Compete Or Compare Strategy, the BBC confirmed the show would be one of the first put up for tender.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Austin|first1=Jamie|title=BBC names first shows in new competitive tendering plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/BBC-first-shows-competitive-tendering|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=19 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027133911/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/BBC-first-shows-competitive-tendering|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the tender released in October, it was confirmed the contract, open to independent producers and [[BBC Studios]], would be for 3 series of a minimum 50 episodes per series, delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission and produced from the existing production base at [[BBC Elstree Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Invitation to Tender (ITT) |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/bbc-content-invitation-to-tender-holby-city-october-2016.pdf |website=[[BBC]] |accessdate=19 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020052444/http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/bbc-content-invitation-to-tender-holby-city-october-2016.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df= }}</ref> BBC Studios was announced as the winning bidder and will continue to produce the show through to 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC - BBC Studios awarded Holby City tender - Commissioning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/news/articles/bbc-studios-awarded-holby-city-tender-march-2017|accessdate=14 December 2017|work=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n''Holby City'' was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', which is set in the [[emergency department]] of the fictional Holby City Hospital.<ref name=\"digital spy1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holbycity/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |title='Holby City's exec producer stands down |last=Green |first=Kris |date=14 December 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=12 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r17Zw9V1?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FILM+of+the+season;+BABE,+Christmas+Day,+BBC1+7pm.-a060945126|title=Film of the season;
