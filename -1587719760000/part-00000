({{audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) and retrospectively designated the '''Bonn Republic''',<ref>The Bonn Republic&nbsp;\u2014 West German democracy, 1945-1990, Anthony James Nicholls, Longman, 1997</ref> was a state that existed between its formation on 23 May 1949 and [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990. During this [[Cold War]] period, the western portion of Germany was part of the [[Western Bloc]]. The FRG was created during the [[Allied occupation of Germany]] after [[World War II]], established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. Its capital was the city of [[Bonn]].\n\nAt the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was {{lang|la|de facto}} divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and a divided Berlin. Initially, the FRG claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871\u20131945 [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), commonly referred to as [[East Germany]], was an illegally constituted [[puppet state]]. Although the GDR did hold regular elections, these were neither free nor fair and West Germany considered it to be illegitimate.\n\nThree southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952 and the Saarland joined the FRG in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered a {{lang|la|de facto}} eleventh state. While legally not part of the FRG as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin politically aligned itself with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions. The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the economic miracle of the 1950s (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'') when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third-largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with [[NATO]] rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in NATO but was also a proponent of agreements which developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[Group of Seven|G6]] was established in 1975, there was no question as to whether West Germany would become a member.\n\nFollowing the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989]], symbolised by the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opening]] of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the FRG in 1990. Its [[New states of Germany|five post-war states]] ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the FRG on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from ten to sixteen, ending the division of Germany. The reunion did not result in a new country as the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession, whereby West Germany was enlarged to include the additional states of East Germany which had ceased to exist. The expanded FRG retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like the [[United Nations]], NATO, [[OECD]] and the European Union.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nThe official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is {{lang|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}} (Federal Republic of Germany).\n\nIn East Germany, the terms {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} (West Germany) or {{lang|de|westdeutsche Bundesrepublik}} (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|1968 constitution]], when the idea of a single German nation was abandoned by East Germany and as a result West Germans and West Berliners were officially considered foreigners. In the early 1970s, starting in the East German {{lang|de|[[Neues Deutschland]]}}, the initialism [[BRD (Germany)|BRD]] (FRG) for the Federal Republic of Germany began to prevail in East German usage. In 1973, official East German sources adopted it as a standard expression and other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations soon followed suit.\n\nIn reaction to this move, in 1965 the West German [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] [[Erich Mende]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'', recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974, the heads of West German federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications. From then on, West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.<ref>See in general: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, \"Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abk\u00fcrzung \u00abBRD\u00bb\"], in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag&nbsp;\u2013 Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code of West Germany was DE (for ''Deutschland'', Germany), which has remained the country code of Germany after reunification. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the most widely used country codes and the DE code is notably used as a country identifier extending the postal code and as the Internet's country code top-level domain [[.de]]. The less widely used [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] country code of West Germany was DEU, which has also remained the country code of reunified Germany. The now deleted codes for East Germany, on the other hand, were DD in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and DDR in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3.\n\nThe colloquial term West Germany or its equivalent was used in many languages. {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.\n\n==History==\n{{History of Germany}}\n{{Further|History of Germany (1945\u201390)}}\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|upright|[[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation zone borders]] in Germany, 1947.

[[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] was an American [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the British zone. Berlin was a four-power area within the Soviet zone.]]\n\nOn 4\u201311 February 1945 leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe and [[Pacific War|Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific]] were negotiated. Throughout the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] had followed a policy of reclaiming German lands lost in the [[Versailles Treaty]], and of reuniting other territories occupied by German peoples within the [[German Reich]], so the Allies agreed that the boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German national territory from German occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937 were automatically null.  Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be 'valid in international law'; although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that East Prussia and Silesia must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any Peace agreement. The conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]: a [[France|French]] Zone in the far west; a [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest; an [[United States|American]] Zone in the south; and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Zone in the East. [[Berlin]] was separately divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany, only to designate zones of administration.\n\nBy the subsequent [[Potsdam Agreement]], the four Allied Powers asserted joint sovereignty over 'Germany as a whole', defined as the  totality of the territory within the occupation zones. Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] and outside of 'Germany as a whole' were separated from German sovereignty in July 1945 and transferred from Soviet military occupation to Polish and Soviet (in the case of the territory of Kaliningrad) civil administration, their Polish and Soviet status to be confirmed at a final Peace Treaty.  Following wartime commitments by the Allies to the governments-in-exile of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], the Potsdam Protocols also agreed to the 'orderly and humane' transfer to Germany as a whole of the ethnic German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and [[Hungary]]. Eight million German expellees and refugees eventually settled in West Germany. Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge. First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]]. Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. Conversely, the Russian zone became [[East Germany]]. At the same time, new federal states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were formed in the Allied zones; replacing the geography of pre-Nazi German states such as the [[Free State of Prussia]] and the [[Republic of Baden]], which had derived ultimately from former independent German kingdoms and principalities.\n\nIn the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime was characterised as having been a 'criminal' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xxiv,</ref> illegal and illegitimate from the outset; while the [[Weimar Republic]] was characterised as having been a 'failed' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xv,</ref> whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national political, judicial, administrative, and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that a new West Germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|title=How a constitution can safeguard democracy:The German Experience|author=Jutta Limbach|publisher=Goethe-Institut|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220115032/https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nevertheless, the new West Germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the 'overall' German state that was held to have embodied the unified German people since the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848, and which from 1871 had been represented within the [[German Reich]]; albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 May 1945.\n\nIn 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948\u201349), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], eventually became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] (also known as the \"Two-plus-Four Agreement\"); by which transitional status of Germany following [[World War II]] was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law (a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before). The Two-plus-Four Agreement also saw the two parts of Germany confirm their post-war external boundaries as final and irreversible (including the 1945 transfer of former German lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]), and the Allied Powers confirmed their consent to German Reunification.  From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}, the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].\n\n===NATO membership===\n<!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]] and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]-->\n[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow) after the accession of the Saarland in 1957 and before the five {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}} from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]\n\nWith territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old [[Medieval]] [[East Francia]] and the 19th-century [[Napoleonic]] [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, under the terms of the [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] it obtained \"the full authority of a sovereign state\" on 5 May 1955 (although \"full sovereignty\" was not obtained until the [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] in 1990).{{refn |name=Sovereignty |group=lower-alpha |Detlef Junker of the {{lang|de|[[Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg]]}} states \"In the October 23, 1954, Paris Agreements, Adenauer pushed through the following laconic wording: 'The Federal Republic shall accordingly [after termination of the occupation regime] have the full authority of a sovereign state over its internal and external affairs.'

The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948\u201349, which was overcome by the [[Berlin airlift]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]]]]\nThe outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.\n\nThough the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Then other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}}. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in the case of an external attack against Germany or its allies ({{lang|de|B\u00fcndnisfall}}). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.<ref>John A. Reed Jr, ''Germany and NATO'' (National Defense University, 1987) [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a264257.pdf Online].</ref>\n\nThe three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)\n\n===Reforms during the 1960s===\n[[Konrad Adenauer]] was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker. However, he stayed in power for 14 years. The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963.<ref>William Glenn Gray,  \"Adenauer, Erhard, and the Uses of Prosperity.\" ''German Politics and Society'' 25.2 (2007): 86-103.</ref>\n\n{{Main|Spiegel scandal}}\nIn October 1962 the weekly news magazine {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]}} published an analysis of the West German military defence. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of {{lang|de|Der Spiegel}} in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further. He announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963. His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.<ref>Alfred C. Mierzejewski, ''Ludwig Erhard: A Biography'' (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2005) p 179. [https://www.questia.com/library/120073119/ludwig-erhard-a-biography Online]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.\n\nA new coalition was formed to deal with this problem. Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. He led a [[grand coalition]] between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.\n\n[[File:Rudi.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]\nDuring the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|Notstand der Demokratie}} (\"Democracy in Crisis\") and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament.  A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the [[Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as {{lang|de|Jubelperser}}), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the [[Vietnam War|US intervention in Vietnam]], mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.<ref>Kraushaar, Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung, Vol. 2 Rogner und Bernhard, 1998 Dokument Nr. 193, p. 356</ref>\n\nIn the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the [[Nuremberg trials|War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg]] had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|{{lang|de|Auschwitz|nocat=y}} concentration camp]] and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that [[the Holocaust|the {{lang|he-Latn|Shoah|nocat=y}}]] was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term \"Holocaust\" for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when a 1978 [[Holocaust (miniseries)|American mini-series with that name]] was shown on West German television.)  The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.\n\nThe calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a [[Feminism in Germany|feminist movement]] in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.<ref>Reconciliation Policy in Germany 1998\u20132008, Construing the 'Problem' of the Incompatibility of Paid Employment and Care Work, by Cornelius Grebe; pg 92: ''\"However, the 1977 reform of marriage and family law by Social Democrats and Liberals formally gave women the right to take up employment without their spouses' permission.

In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt, they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the \"struggle against imperialism\".<ref>Kraushaar op.cit</ref>  The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the [[Maoist]]s and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the [[Red Brigades]] ({{lang|de|Brigate Rosse}}), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the [[Red Army Faction]] which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |title=RAF: Gefangen in der Geschichte |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508122346/http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Willy Brandt===\n{{main|Willy Brandt}}\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by [[Willy Brandt]]\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.<ref>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Miard-Delacroixm ''Willy Brandt: Life of a Statesman'' (2016)</ref> Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries. (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972.)<ref>Informationen zur Politische Bildung Heft 258, p. 32</ref> These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long-term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over Eastern Europe.

Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Max Otte |author2=J\u00fcrgen Greve |year=2000 |title=A rising middle power?: German foreign policy in transformation, 1989\u20131999 }}</ref>  Mounting external problems forced Schmidt to concentrate on foreign policy and limited the domestic reforms that he could carry out.  The USSR upgraded its intermediate-range missiles, which  Schmidt complained was an unacceptable threat to the balance of nuclear power, because it increased  the likelihood of political coercion and  required a western response.  NATO respond in the form of its twin-track policy.

Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the [[German Green Party|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{Main|German reunification}}\n\nWith the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]; and [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|a final settlement of the post-war special status of Germany]]. Following democratic elections, East Germany declared its accession to the Federal Republic subject to the terms of the Unification Treaty between the two states; and then both West Germany and East Germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that Treaty's provisions. East Germany then dissolved itself, and its five post-war states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building|{{lang|de|Reichstag|nocat=y}} building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.\n\nHowever, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].\n\n==Economic miracle==\nThe West German {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}} (\"economic miracle\", coined by ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950) was due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  This improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the {{lang|de|[[Reichsmark]]}} with the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mark]]}} and halted rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038788-0006, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk, K\u00e4fer.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]]{{spaced ndash}}for many years the most successful car in the world{{spaced ndash}}on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973]]\n\nAs demand for consumer goods increased after World War II, the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of {{lang|de|[[Gastarbeiter]]}} (\"guest workers\") provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.<ref>[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519121934/https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=19 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWith the dropping of Allied reparations, the freeing of German intellectual property and the impact of the Marshall Plan stimulus, West Germany developed one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The fading miracle : four decades of market economy in Germany |last=Giersch, Herbert. |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-35351-3 |location=Cambridge [England] |oclc=24065456}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, West Germany became part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]]. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared to have the \"authority of a sovereign state\".<ref name=\"Sovereignty\" group=\"lower-alpha\"/> The [[British Armed Forces|British]], [[Military of France|French]] and [[Military of the United States|U.S. militaries]] remained in the country, just as the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] remained in East Germany. Four days after obtaining the \"authority of a sovereign state\" in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The UK and the USA retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the [[G8|Group of Six]] (G6).

reunification}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]], 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]\n\nThe official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of \"{{lang|de|Neue [[Ostpolitik]]}}\" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany as a whole.\n\nFollowing the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state.  By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 14]}}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and  agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 308}}</ref>\n: \"... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.\" <ref>{{citation|url=https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|title=Texas Law: Foreign Law Translations 1973|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152049/https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe West German Constitution ({{lang|de|Grundgesetz}}, \"Basic Law\") provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:\n\n* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).\n* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.\n\nAfter the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR and the re-establishment of {{lang|de|[[New states of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]}} on the territory of East Germany; and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had nominally declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.\n\nThe two German states entered into a [[monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the re-established [[New states of Germany|five East German {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder|nocat=y}}]] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.\n\n==Politics==\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966\u201369). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other right-wing parties.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, the [[Villa Hammerschmidt]] ]]\nKiesinger's 1966\u201369 \"Grand Coalition\" was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts\u2014the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].\n\nLeading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|[[Notstand der Demokratie]]}} (\"Democracy in a State of Emergency\") and the [[trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.\n\nBy 1968 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1970s [[environmentalism]] and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result, in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.\n\nAnother result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021 Kohl (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1987]]\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression<ref>[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901014759/http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html |date=1 September 2009 }} on 21 October 2002</ref><ref>Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen: ''Willy Brandt.

As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time\".<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113174538/http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all |date=13 January 2009 }} In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>\n\nFinance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD\u2013FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".\n\nThe goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.\n\n===Denazification===\n{{See also|Denazification|List of companies involved in the Holocaust}}\nIn 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany. West German President [[Walter Scheel]] and Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] were both former members of the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1957, 77% of the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|West German Ministry of Justice]]'s senior officials were former Nazi Party members.<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's post-war justice ministry was infested with Nazis protecting former comrades, study reveals |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 October 2016 |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223605/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |archive-date=23 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Konrad Adenauer's State Secretary [[Hans Globke]] had played a major role in drafting anti-semitic [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] in Nazi Germany.<ref>Tetens, T.H.

Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] held in West Germany]]\n\nIn the 20th century, [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2\u20131 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAfter both [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1936]] had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called \"West German\" before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs of 2012, West Germany have played a record 43 matches at the European Championships.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=2013 Guinness World Records Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257 257]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257}}</ref>\n\n===Literary scene===\nBesides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the {{lang|de|[[Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur]]}}. [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] (and its  [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]]) soon developed into a regarded institution. Exemplary for West Germany's literature are \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Siegfried Lenz]] (with ''[[The German Lesson]]'') and [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] (with ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' and ''[[The Flounder]]'').\n\n==Geographical distribution of government==\n\nIn West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].\n\nThe West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts ({{lang|de|Bezirke}}), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}}, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.\n\n==Present geographical and political terminology==\nToday, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[Western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the {{lang|de|Alte Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (old states) and the {{lang|de|Neue Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (new states), although {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} and {{lang|de|Ostdeutschland}} are still heard as well.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany}}\n* [[Economic history of the German reunification]]\n* [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]]\n* [[Petersberg Agreement]]\n* [[West Berlin]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bark, Dennis L., and David R.

({{audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) and retrospectively designated the '''Bonn Republic''',<ref>The Bonn Republic&nbsp;\u2014 West German democracy, 1945-1990, Anthony James Nicholls, Longman, 1997</ref> was a state that existed between its formation on 23 May 1949 and [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990. During this [[Cold War]] period, the western portion of Germany was part of the [[Western Bloc]]. The FRG was created during the [[Allied occupation of Germany]] after [[World War II]], established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. Its capital was the city of [[Bonn]].\n\nAt the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was {{lang|la|de facto}} divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and a divided Berlin. Initially, the FRG claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871\u20131945 [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), commonly referred to as East Germany, was an illegally constituted [[puppet state]]. Although the GDR did hold regular elections, these were neither free nor fair and West Germany considered it to be illegitimate.\n\nThree southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952 and the Saarland joined the FRG in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered a {{lang|la|de facto}} eleventh state. While legally not part of the FRG as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin politically aligned itself with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions. The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the economic miracle of the 1950s (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'') when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third-largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with [[NATO]] rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in NATO but was also a proponent of agreements which developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[Group of Seven|G6]] was established in 1975, there was no question as to whether West Germany would become a member.\n\nFollowing the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989]], symbolised by the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opening]] of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the FRG in 1990. Its [[New states of Germany|five post-war states]] ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the FRG on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from ten to sixteen, ending the division of Germany. The reunion did not result in a new country as the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession, whereby West Germany was enlarged to include the additional states of East Germany which had ceased to exist. The expanded FRG retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like the [[United Nations]], NATO, [[OECD]] and the European Union.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nThe official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is {{lang|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}} (Federal Republic of Germany).\n\nIn East Germany, the terms {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} (West Germany) or {{lang|de|westdeutsche Bundesrepublik}} (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|1968 constitution]], when the idea of a single German nation was abandoned by East Germany and as a result West Germans and West Berliners were officially considered foreigners. In the early 1970s, starting in the East German {{lang|de|[[Neues Deutschland]]}}, the initialism [[BRD (Germany)|BRD]] (FRG) for the Federal Republic of Germany began to prevail in East German usage. In 1973, official East German sources adopted it as a standard expression and other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations soon followed suit.\n\nIn reaction to this move, in 1965 the West German [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] [[Erich Mende]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'', recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974, the heads of West German federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications. From then on, West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.<ref>See in general: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, \"Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abk\u00fcrzung \u00abBRD\u00bb\"], in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag&nbsp;\u2013 Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code of West Germany was DE (for ''Deutschland'', Germany), which has remained the country code of Germany after reunification. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the most widely used country codes and the DE code is notably used as a country identifier extending the postal code and as the Internet's country code top-level domain [[.de]]. The less widely used [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] country code of West Germany was DEU, which has also remained the country code of reunified Germany. The now deleted codes for East Germany, on the other hand, were DD in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and DDR in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3.\n\nThe colloquial term West Germany or its equivalent was used in many languages. {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.\n\n==History==\n{{History of Germany}}\n{{Further|History of Germany (1945\u201390)}}\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|upright|[[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation zone borders]] in Germany, 1947.

[[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] was an American [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the British zone. Berlin was a four-power area within the Soviet zone.]]\n\nOn 4\u201311 February 1945 leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe and [[Pacific War|Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific]] were negotiated. Throughout the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] had followed a policy of reclaiming German lands lost in the [[Versailles Treaty]], and of reuniting other territories occupied by German peoples within the [[German Reich]], so the Allies agreed that the boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German national territory from German occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937 were automatically null.  Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be 'valid in international law'; although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that East Prussia and Silesia must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any Peace agreement. The conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]: a [[France|French]] Zone in the far west; a [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest; an [[United States|American]] Zone in the south; and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Zone in the East. [[Berlin]] was separately divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany, only to designate zones of administration.\n\nBy the subsequent [[Potsdam Agreement]], the four Allied Powers asserted joint sovereignty over 'Germany as a whole', defined as the  totality of the territory within the occupation zones. Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] and outside of 'Germany as a whole' were separated from German sovereignty in July 1945 and transferred from Soviet military occupation to Polish and Soviet (in the case of the territory of Kaliningrad) civil administration, their Polish and Soviet status to be confirmed at a final Peace Treaty.  Following wartime commitments by the Allies to the governments-in-exile of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], the Potsdam Protocols also agreed to the 'orderly and humane' transfer to Germany as a whole of the ethnic German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and [[Hungary]]. Eight million German expellees and refugees eventually settled in West Germany. Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge. First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]]. Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. Conversely, the Russian zone became [[East Germany]]. At the same time, new federal states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were formed in the Allied zones; replacing the geography of pre-Nazi German states such as the [[Free State of Prussia]] and the [[Republic of Baden]], which had derived ultimately from former independent German kingdoms and principalities.\n\nIn the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime was characterised as having been a 'criminal' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xxiv,</ref> illegal and illegitimate from the outset; while the [[Weimar Republic]] was characterised as having been a 'failed' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xv,</ref> whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national political, judicial, administrative, and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that a new West Germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|title=How a constitution can safeguard democracy:The German Experience|author=Jutta Limbach|publisher=Goethe-Institut|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220115032/https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nevertheless, the new West Germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the 'overall' German state that was held to have embodied the unified German people since the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848, and which from 1871 had been represented within the [[German Reich]]; albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 May 1945.\n\nIn 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948\u201349), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], eventually became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] (also known as the \"Two-plus-Four Agreement\"); by which transitional status of Germany following [[World War II]] was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law (a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before). The Two-plus-Four Agreement also saw the two parts of Germany confirm their post-war external boundaries as final and irreversible (including the 1945 transfer of former German lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]), and the Allied Powers confirmed their consent to German Reunification.  From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}, the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].\n\n===NATO membership===\n<!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]] and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]-->\n[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow) after the accession of the Saarland in 1957 and before the five {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}} from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]\n\nWith territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old [[Medieval]] [[East Francia]] and the 19th-century [[Napoleonic]] [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, under the terms of the [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] it obtained \"the full authority of a sovereign state\" on 5 May 1955 (although \"full sovereignty\" was not obtained until the [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] in 1990).{{refn |name=Sovereignty |group=lower-alpha |Detlef Junker of the {{lang|de|[[Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg]]}} states \"In the October 23, 1954, Paris Agreements, Adenauer pushed through the following laconic wording: 'The Federal Republic shall accordingly [after termination of the occupation regime] have the full authority of a sovereign state over its internal and external affairs.'

The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948\u201349, which was overcome by the [[Berlin airlift]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]]]]\nThe outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.\n\nThough the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Then other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}}. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in the case of an external attack against Germany or its allies ({{lang|de|B\u00fcndnisfall}}). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.<ref>John A. Reed Jr, ''Germany and NATO'' (National Defense University, 1987) [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a264257.pdf Online].</ref>\n\nThe three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)\n\n===Reforms during the 1960s===\n[[Konrad Adenauer]] was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker. However, he stayed in power for 14 years. The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963.<ref>William Glenn Gray,  \"Adenauer, Erhard, and the Uses of Prosperity.\" ''German Politics and Society'' 25.2 (2007): 86-103.</ref>\n\n{{Main|Spiegel scandal}}\nIn October 1962 the weekly news magazine {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]}} published an analysis of the West German military defence. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of {{lang|de|Der Spiegel}} in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further. He announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963. His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.<ref>Alfred C. Mierzejewski, ''Ludwig Erhard: A Biography'' (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2005) p 179. [https://www.questia.com/library/120073119/ludwig-erhard-a-biography Online]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.\n\nA new coalition was formed to deal with this problem. Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. He led a [[grand coalition]] between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.\n\n[[File:Rudi.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]\nDuring the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|Notstand der Demokratie}} (\"Democracy in Crisis\") and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament.  A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the [[Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as {{lang|de|Jubelperser}}), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the [[Vietnam War|US intervention in Vietnam]], mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.<ref>Kraushaar, Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung, Vol. 2 Rogner und Bernhard, 1998 Dokument Nr. 193, p. 356</ref>\n\nIn the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the [[Nuremberg trials|War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg]] had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|{{lang|de|Auschwitz|nocat=y}} concentration camp]] and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that [[the Holocaust|the {{lang|he-Latn|Shoah|nocat=y}}]] was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term \"Holocaust\" for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when a 1978 [[Holocaust (miniseries)|American mini-series with that name]] was shown on West German television.)  The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.\n\nThe calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a [[Feminism in Germany|feminist movement]] in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.<ref>Reconciliation Policy in Germany 1998\u20132008, Construing the 'Problem' of the Incompatibility of Paid Employment and Care Work, by Cornelius Grebe; pg 92: ''\"However, the 1977 reform of marriage and family law by Social Democrats and Liberals formally gave women the right to take up employment without their spouses' permission.

In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt, they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the \"struggle against imperialism\".<ref>Kraushaar op.cit</ref>  The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the [[Maoist]]s and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the [[Red Brigades]] ({{lang|de|Brigate Rosse}}), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the [[Red Army Faction]] which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |title=RAF: Gefangen in der Geschichte |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508122346/http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Willy Brandt===\n{{main|Willy Brandt}}\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by [[Willy Brandt]]\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.<ref>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Miard-Delacroixm ''Willy Brandt: Life of a Statesman'' (2016)</ref> Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries. (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972.)<ref>Informationen zur Politische Bildung Heft 258, p. 32</ref> These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long-term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over Eastern Europe. Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}.

The requirement also stipulated the extent to which the technical standards established by national and international organisations can be regarded as \"rules of the art\".<ref name=\"aei.pitt.edu\"/> In a directive of 10 November 1970, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs recommended to the higher authorities for work protection of the \"Lander\" to bring in the directive published, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour, by the German Engineers' Association on the evaluation of work station noise in relation to loss of hearing, in order to improve safeguards for workers against the noises in question. In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved. In August 1971, a law came into force directed at reducing atmospheric pollution from lead compounds in four-stroke engine fuels. As a safeguard against radiation, a decree on the system of authorisations for medicaments treated with ionizing radiation or containing radioactive substances, in its version of 8 August 1967, was remodelled by a new Decree of 10 May 1971 which added some radionuclides to the list of medicaments which doctors in private practice were authorized to use.\n\nBy a decree of the Federal Minister for Labour and Social Order, the Federal Institute for Industrial Protection became the Federal Agency for Industrial Protection and Accident Research. Amongst its designated tasks included the promotion of industrial protection, accident prevention on the journey to and from work and accident prevention in the home and leisure activities, the encouragement of training and advanced training in the area of industrial protection, and to promote and coordinate accident research. A regulation was issued in 1972 which permitted for the first time the employment of women as drivers of trams, omnibuses and lorries, while further regulations laid down new provisions for lifts and work with compressed air.<ref name=\"aei.pitt\" /> The Factory Constitution Law (1971) strengthened the rights of individual employees \"to be informed and to be heard on matters concerning their place of work\". The Works Council was provided with greater authority while trade unions were given the right of entry into the factory \"provided they informed the employer of their intention to do so\",<ref name=\"Childs\"/> while a law was passed to encourage wider share ownership by workers and other rank-and-file employees.<ref name=\"Childs\"/> The Industrial Relations Law (1972) and the Personnel Representation Act (1974) broadened the rights of employees in matters which immediately affected their places of work, while also improving the possibilities for codetermination on operations committees, together with access of trade unions to companies.<ref name=\"willy-brandt.org\"/>\n\nThe Works Constitution Act of 1972 required in cases of collective dismissal at an establishment normally employing more than twenty employees that management and the works council must negotiate a social plan that stipulates compensation for workers who lose their jobs. In cases where the two parties could not agree on a social plan, the law provided for binding arbitration.<ref>{{harvp|Abraham|Houseman|1994}}</ref> In 1972, the rights of works councils to information from management were not only strengthened, but works councils were also provided with full codetermination rights on issues such as working time arrangements in the plant, the setting of piece rates, plant wage systems, the establishment of vacation times, work breaks, overtime, and short-time work.<ref>{{harvp|Thelen|1991|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=BokmF9j1hx0C&pg=PA100 100]}}</ref> Legislation was passed which acknowledged for the first time the presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils.<ref name=\"autogenerated8\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/MXQU1P,0,0,Informationen_zur_politischen |title=IZPB &#124; bpb |language=de |publisher=Bpb.de |accessdate=2012-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131074330/http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/MXQU1P,0,0,Informationen_zur_politischen |archive-date=31 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA law of January 1972 on the organization of labour in enterprises significantly extended the works council's right of cooperation and co-management in the matter of vocational training. That same year, the Safety Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany was transformed into a public Federal Agency (Bundesanstalt) with significantly enlarged powers, in the context of which special emphasis would be placed on its new task of promoting and coordinating research in the area of accident prevention.<ref name=\"aei.pitt\" /> New provisions were introduced for the rehabilitation of severely disabled people (\"Schwerbehinderte\") and accident victims.<ref name=\"MyLife\" /> The Severely Disabled Persons Act of April 1974 obliged all employers with more than fifteen employees to ensure that 6% of their workforce consisted of people officially recognised as being severely handicapped. Employers who failed to do so were assessed 100 DM per month for every job falling before the required quota. These compensatory payments were used to \"subsidise the adaptation of workplaces to the requirements of those who were severely handicapped\".<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nA law passed in January 1974, designed to protect members of the supervisory boards of companies who are undergoing training, was aimed at ensuring that the representatives of young workers and youthful members of works councils still undergoing training could perform their duties with greater independence and without fear of disadvantageous consequences for their future careers. On request, workers' representatives on completion of their training courses had to have an employment relationship of unlimited duration.<ref name=\"aei.pitt_c\" /> In the field of transport, the

The USSR upgraded its intermediate-range missiles, which  Schmidt complained was an unacceptable threat to the balance of nuclear power, because it increased  the likelihood of political coercion and  required a western response.

Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the [[German Green Party|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{Main|German reunification}}\n\nWith the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]; and [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|a final settlement of the post-war special status of Germany]]. Following democratic elections, East Germany declared its accession to the Federal Republic subject to the terms of the Unification Treaty between the two states; and then both West Germany and East Germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that Treaty's provisions. East Germany then dissolved itself, and its five post-war states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building|{{lang|de|Reichstag|nocat=y}} building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.\n\nHowever, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].\n\n==Economic miracle==\nThe West German {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}} (\"economic miracle\", coined by ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950) was due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  This improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the {{lang|de|[[Reichsmark]]}} with the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mark]]}} and halted rampant inflation.

At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of {{lang|de|[[Gastarbeiter]]}} (\"guest workers\") provided a vital base for the economic upturn.

reunification}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]], 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]\n\nThe official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of \"{{lang|de|Neue [[Ostpolitik]]}}\" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany as a whole.\n\nFollowing the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state.  By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 14]}}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and  agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 308}}</ref>\n: \"... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.\" <ref>{{citation|url=https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|title=Texas Law: Foreign Law Translations 1973|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152049/https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe West German Constitution ({{lang|de|Grundgesetz}}, \"Basic Law\") provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:\n\n* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).\n* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.\n\nAfter the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR and the re-establishment of {{lang|de|[[New states of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]}} on the territory of East Germany; and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had nominally declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.\n\nThe two German states entered into a [[monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the re-established [[New states of Germany|five East German {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder|nocat=y}}]] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.\n\n==Politics==\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966\u201369). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other right-wing parties.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, the [[Villa Hammerschmidt]] ]]\nKiesinger's 1966\u201369 \"Grand Coalition\" was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts\u2014the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].\n\nLeading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|[[Notstand der Demokratie]]}} (\"Democracy in a State of Emergency\") and the [[trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.\n\nBy 1968 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1970s [[environmentalism]] and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result, in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.\n\nAnother result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021 Kohl (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1987]]\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression<ref>[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901014759/http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html |date=1 September 2009 }} on 21 October 2002</ref><ref>Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen: ''Willy Brandt.

As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time\".<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113174538/http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all |date=13 January 2009 }} In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>\n\nFinance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD\u2013FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".\n\nThe goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.\n\n===Denazification===\n{{See also|Denazification|List of companies involved in the Holocaust}}\nIn 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany. West German President [[Walter Scheel]] and Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] were both former members of the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1957, 77% of the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|West German Ministry of Justice]]'s senior officials were former Nazi Party members.<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's post-war justice ministry was infested with Nazis protecting former comrades, study reveals |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 October 2016 |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223605/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |archive-date=23 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Konrad Adenauer's State Secretary [[Hans Globke]] had played a major role in drafting anti-semitic [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] in Nazi Germany.<ref>Tetens, T.H.

Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] held in West Germany]]\n\nIn the 20th century, [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2\u20131 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAfter both [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1936]] had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called \"West German\" before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs of 2012, West Germany have played a record 43 matches at the European Championships.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=2013 Guinness World Records Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257 257]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257}}</ref>\n\n===Literary scene===\nBesides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period.

Exemplary for West Germany's literature are \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Siegfried Lenz]] (with ''[[The German Lesson]]'') and [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] (with ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' and ''[[The Flounder]]'').\n\n==Geographical distribution of government==\n\nIn West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].\n\nThe West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts ({{lang|de|Bezirke}}), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}}, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.\n\n==Present geographical and political terminology==\nToday, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[Western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the {{lang|de|Alte Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (old states) and the {{lang|de|Neue Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (new states), although {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} and {{lang|de|Ostdeutschland}} are still heard as well.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany}}\n* [[Economic history of the German reunification]]\n* [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]]\n* [[Petersberg Agreement]]\n* [[West Berlin]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bark, Dennis L., and David R.

However, the judge kept the 11 charges of wire fraud.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-theranos/u-s-judge-drops-some-charges-against-theranoss-holmes-leaves-wire-fraud-idUSKBN2060GN |title=U.S. judge drops some charges against Theranos's Holmes, leaves wire fraud |work=Reuters |author= |date=February 12, 2020 |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/elizabeth-holmes-attorneys-ask-judge-to-throw-out-theranos-fraud-case.html |title=Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 attorneys ask judge to throw out Theranos fraud case |work=[[CNBC]] |author=Yasmin Khorram |date=February 10, 2020 |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional activities==\nHolmes partnered with [[Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa]] in June 2015 to improve blood testing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2015/06/22/with-carlos-slim-billionaire-elizabeth-holmes-brings-innovative-blood-testing-method-to-mexico/#8a29eafa7892 | title = With Carlos Slim, Billionaire Elizabeth Holmes Brings Innovative Blood Testing Method To Mexico | work = Forbes | date = June 22, 2015 | accessdate = October 24, 2016 | author = Estevez, Dolia}}</ref> In October 2015, she announced #IronSisters to help women in [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] careers.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/elizabeth-holmes-calls-on-women/ | title = Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes calls on women to help each other | work = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 24, 2016 | author = Lev-Ram, Michal}}</ref> In 2015, she helped to draft and pass a law in Arizona to let people obtain and pay for lab tests without requiring insurance or healthcare provider approval, while misrepresenting the accuracy and effectiveness of the Theranos device.<ref name=badblood/><ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/02/new-arizona-law-and-fda-approval-gives-theranos-something-to-celebrate/29634373/ | title = Now no doctor's note needed for blood test in Arizona | work = [[USA Today]] | date = July 2, 2015 | accessdate = October 24, 2016 | last= della Cava |first=Marco}}</ref>\n\n==Connections==\nTheranos's board and investors included many influential figures.<ref name=badblood/><ref name=\"Abelson2018\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/health/theranos-investors-murdoch-devos-walmart.html |title=Caught in the Theranos Wreckage: Betsy DeVos, Rupert Murdoch and Walmart's Waltons |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Abelson |first= Reed |date=May 4, 2018 |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}</ref> Holmes's first major investor was [[Tim Draper]] \u2013 Silicon Valley [[Venture capital|venture capitalist]] and father of Holmes's childhood friend [[Jesse Draper]] \u2013 who \"cut Holmes a check\" for $1 million upon hearing her initial pitch for the firm that would become Theranos.<ref name=Dropout2019>{{cite book|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dropout/id1449500734?mt=2|title=The Dropout by ABC News on Apple Podcasts|author=|date=|website=Apple Podcasts|accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Gibney2019>{{cite AV media | people=Gibney, Alex (Director) | date=March 18, 2019 | title=[[The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley]]| medium=Motion picture | location=U.S.| publisher=HBO}}</ref> Theranos's pool of major investors expanded to include:<ref name=\"Abelson2018\"/> [[Rupert Murdoch]]; the [[Walton family]]; the DeVos family including [[Betsy DeVos]]; the Cox family of [[Cox Enterprises]]; and [[Carlos Slim|Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa]].

It appears as ''Newerche'' in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \"New fort\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 339.</ref>\n\nThe origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], due to its position on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription. The [[Newark wapentake]] in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] rule (10th\u201311th centuries).\n\n===Medieval to Stuart period===\n[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] was originally a [[Saxon]] fortified [[manor house]] founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint.

The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity.

The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829.

Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N.

To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673.

[[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party.

It stands on the [[River Trent]], the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] \u2013 on the route of the ancient [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] \u2013 and the [[East Coast Main Line]] railway. The origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], as it lies on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. The town grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place, now lined with historic buildings. It was a centre for the wool and cloth trades. In the [[English Civil War]], it was besieged by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] and [[Relief of Newark|relieved]] by [[Cavaliers|Royalist forces]] under [[Prince Rupert]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:UK NewarkonTrent.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost in Newark-on-Trent]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe place-name Newark is first attested in the [[Cartulary]] of [[Eynsham Abbey]] in Oxfordshire, where it appears as ''Newercha'' in about 1054\u20131057 and ''Niweweorche'' in about 1075\u20131092. It appears as ''Newerche'' in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \"New fort\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 339.</ref>\n\nThe origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], due to its position on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription. The [[Newark wapentake]] in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] rule (10th\u201311th centuries).\n\n===Medieval to Stuart period===\n[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] was originally a [[Saxon]] fortified [[manor house]] founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint. [[John, King of England|King John]] died of [[dysentery]] in Newark Castle in 1216.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Greig |title=King John: Dysentery and the death that changed history |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111204955/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |archivedate=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all|date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade \u2013 by the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a major market was established.

The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829.

Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N.

These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

A special plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials and this is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also contains 49 scattered burials from the [[First World War]]. A memorial cross to the Polish airmen buried here was unveiled in 1941 by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz|President Raczkiewicz]], ex-President of the Polish Republic and head of the wartime Polish Government in London, supported by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski|General Sikorski]], head of the Polish Armed Forces and wartime Polish Prime Minister.

To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673.

[[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party.
