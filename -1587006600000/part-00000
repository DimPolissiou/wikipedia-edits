The scheme was aborted in the 1930s.

In 1893, the three territories came under a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]] and were united to form what is now known as Laos.

Laos became independent in 1953, with a [[constitutional monarchy]] under [[Sisavang Vong]]. A post-independence [[Laos Civil War|civil war]] began, which saw the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|communist resistance]], supported by the [[Soviet Union]], fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the [[United States]]. After the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, the [[Communism|communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] came to power, ending the civil war.

In the late 1920s, work began on the Thakhek\u2013Tan Ap railway that would have run between [[Thakhek]], [[Khammouane Province]] and [[T\u00e2n \u1ea4p Railway Station]], [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]], Vietnam through the [[M\u1ee5 Gi\u1ea1 Pass]]. The scheme was aborted in the 1930s. The major roads connecting the major urban centres, in particular [[Route 13 (Laos)|Route 13]], have been significantly upgraded in recent years, but villages far from major roads can be reached only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year-round.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThere is limited external and internal telecommunication, but mobile phones have become widespread in urban centres.

Weeks later, while playing with his siblings, he is caught by dog catchers, is whisked away to the [[dog pound]] and is quickly [[euthanized]], wondering if \"fun\" truly is life's purpose.\n\nThe dog's spirit is [[reincarnation|reborn]] in a newborn [[Golden Retriever]] puppy in 1961. He leaves his cage at a [[puppy mill]] and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him. They leave to drink, leaving the dog locked inside their pick-up truck. He begins to die of heatstroke, but is then spotted by a kindhearted mother and her eight-year-old son Ethan Montgomery, who break the truck's window and rescue him. They bring him home and introduce him to Ethan's father. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and is renamed Bailey.\n\nBailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. Years pass, and after several attempts at advancing in his job fail, Ethan's father has become a deadbeat alcoholic.\n\nOver the summer, Ethan goes to a fair with Bailey and meets Hannah, whom he soon begins dating. Ethan and Hannah spend their summer together happily though their senior years are upcoming, but they plan to go to the same school; Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah following him on an academic one. When he goes home one night, Ethan's father is drunk and shouting at Ethan's mother. He turns on Ethan then and when his mother tries to keep them separated, he shoves her to the ground. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back.\n\nLater, at a football game watched by scouts, Ethan is offered a full scholarship to Michigan State, but that night a vindictive classmate named Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house, which results in a house fire. Bailey alerts Ethan, who goes to save his mother. Unable to get out of the door, they head out through his mother's bedroom window upstairs. Ethan first lowers her with her sheets to the neighbors below, then saves Bailey. However, he drops his rope and must jump, badly fracturing his leg and ending his athletic scholarship. Bailey attacks Todd, who is arrested by the police when firecrackers fall out of his pocket. Now, Ethan must go to an [[agricultural school]] where he will learn to take over his grandparents' farm. Falling into depression, Ethan breaks off his romance with Hannah before leaving for college, while Bailey stays with Ethan's grandparents. Shortly afterwards, Bailey becomes old and his health begins deteriorating. Ethan's grandparents take Bailey to the veterinarian's office, but Dr. Joyce is unable to save him, and Ethan comes into the office and watches as his beloved dog is put to sleep.\n\nThe moment he passes away, Bailey again is reborn into another dog life, a female German Shepherd puppy, who grows into a [[police dog]] named Ellie, sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s, while possessing full memories of her past lives. Ellie is partnered with a lonely widowed officer named Carlos Ruiz, of the [[Chicago Police Department]] and works hard at \"seeking\" and \"finding\", now seeing the job as life's purpose. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie saves a kidnapped girl from drowning and is then fatally shot by the kidnapper. Carlos breaks down in tears as his precious dog dies in his arms.\n\nReborn again in the mid-1980s as a male [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] puppy, Bailey forms a bond with an Atlanta college student named Maya who names him Tino. Maya is lonely, and Tino makes it his purpose to find her some happiness. She starts a relationship with a classmate named Al whom she begins seeing after Tino falls for Al's dog, a black and white female [[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]] named Roxy. Maya and Al marry and have 3 children. In love with Roxy and now seeing her as his purpose, Tino is heartbroken when one day Roxy does not return from the vet. As a now elderly Tino dies, he thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives.\n\nBailey passes away as Tino and reincarnates into his next dog life, this time as a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Australian Shepherd]] mix puppy sometime in the mid-to-late 2000s, and is taken in by an urban lady named Wendi, who names him Waffles. Unfortunately, Wendi's neglectful husband Victor refuses to let her keep Waffles inside and, after several years, dumps him in an abandoned lot. Afterwards, Waffles sets off in search of a new life. He gradually makes his way to the country area where he spent summers as Bailey and joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now in his 50s, living a lonely life at his grandparents' old farm, which he now owns and runs. Not recognizing his dog, Ethan hands him over to the local animal shelter but has a change of heart and reclaims him, naming him Buddy. Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the true purpose of life, reunites Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they get married.\n\nBuddy convinces Ethan that he is his beloved childhood dog, by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them many years back, such as \"boss dog\". Ethan digs up Bailey's collar, now old and rusty, and places it back on Bailey's neck, and they resume playing exactly the way they did so long ago.

Weeks later, while playing with his siblings, he is caught by dog catchers, is whisked away to the [[dog pound]] and is quickly [[euthanized]], wondering if \"fun\" truly is life's purpose.\n\nThe dog's spirit is [[reincarnation|reborn]] in a newborn [[Golden Retriever]] puppy in 1961. He leaves his cage at a [[puppy mill]] and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him. They leave to drink, leaving the dog locked inside their pick-up truck. He begins to die of heatstroke, but is then spotted by a kindhearted mother and her eight-year-old son Ethan Montgomery, who break the truck's window and rescue him. They bring him home and introduce him to Ethan's father. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and is renamed Bailey.\n\nBailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. Years pass, and after several attempts at advancing in his job fail, Ethan's father has become a deadbeat alcoholic.\n\nOver the summer, Ethan goes to a fair with Bailey and meets Hannah, whom he soon begins dating. Ethan and Hannah spend their summer together happily though their senior years are upcoming, but they plan to go to the same school; Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah following him on an academic one. When he goes home one night, Ethan's father is drunk and shouting at Ethan's mother. He turns on Ethan then and when his mother tries to keep them separated, he shoves her to the ground. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back.\n\nLater, at a football game watched by scouts, Ethan is offered a full scholarship to Michigan State, but that night a vindictive classmate named Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house, which results in a house fire. Bailey alerts Ethan, who goes to save his mother. Unable to get out of the door, they head out through his mother's bedroom window upstairs. Ethan first lowers her with her sheets to the neighbors below, then saves Bailey. However, he drops his rope and must jump, badly fracturing his leg and ending his athletic scholarship. Bailey attacks Todd, who is arrested by the police when firecrackers fall out of his pocket. Now, Ethan must go to an [[agricultural school]] where he will learn to take over his grandparents' farm. Falling into depression, Ethan breaks off his romance with Hannah before leaving for college, while Bailey stays with Ethan's grandparents. Shortly afterwards, Bailey becomes old and his health begins deteriorating. Ethan's grandparents take Bailey to the veterinarian's office, but Dr. Joyce is unable to save him, and Ethan comes into the office and watches as his beloved dog is put to sleep.\n\nThe moment he passes away, Bailey again is reborn into another dog life, a female German Shepherd puppy, who grows into a [[police dog]] named Ellie, sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s, while possessing full memories of her past lives. Ellie is partnered with a lonely widowed officer named Carlos Ruiz, of the [[Chicago Police Department]] and works hard at \"seeking\" and \"finding\", now seeing the job as life's purpose. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie saves a kidnapped girl from drowning and is then fatally shot by the kidnapper. Carlos breaks down in tears as his precious dog dies in his arms.\n\nReborn again in the mid-1980s as a male [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] puppy, Bailey forms a bond with an Atlanta college student named Maya who names him Tino. Maya is lonely, and Tino makes it his purpose to find her some happiness. She starts a relationship with a classmate named Al whom she begins seeing after Tino falls for Al's dog, a black and white female [[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]] named Roxy. Maya and Al marry and have 3 children. In love with Roxy and now seeing her as his purpose, Tino is heartbroken when one day Roxy does not return from the vet. As a now elderly Tino dies, he thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives.\n\nBailey passes away as Tino and reincarnates into his next dog life, this time as a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Australian Shepherd]] mix puppy sometime in the mid-to-late 2000s, and is taken in by an urban lady named Wendi, who names him Waffles. Unfortunately, Wendi's neglectful husband Victor refuses to let her keep Waffles inside and, after several years, dumps him in an abandoned lot. Afterwards, Waffles sets off in search of a new life. He gradually makes his way to the country area where he spent summers as Bailey and joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now in his 50s, living a lonely life at his grandparents' old farm, which he now owns and runs. Not recognizing his dog, Ethan hands him over to the local animal shelter but has a change of heart and reclaims him, naming him Buddy. Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the true purpose of life, reunites Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they get married.\n\nBuddy convinces Ethan that he is his beloved childhood dog, by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them many years back, such as \"boss dog\". Ethan digs up Bailey's collar, now old and rusty, and places it back on Bailey's neck, and they resume playing exactly the way they did so long ago. Bailey narrates that life is about having fun, saving others, finding someone to be with, not getting upset over the past or the future, and living for today.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Gad]] as the voice

Simmons appeared onstage as a [[DJ]] for solo rapper [[Kurtis Blow]], who was managed by Russell. Known as \"DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow\", Simmons soon began performing with Kurtis Blow.<ref name=\"oldschoolhiphop profile\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/emcees/rundmc.htm|title=Run DMC Biography |website=OldSchoolHipHop.com}}</ref> Previously, McDaniels had been more focused on athletics than music, but soon began to DJ after purchasing a set of [[Phonograph|turntables]]. Simmons convinced McDaniels to start rapping, and though McDaniels would not perform in public, he soon began writing rhymes and was known as \"Easy D.\"\n\nSimmons and McDaniels started hanging around Two-Fifths Park in Hollis in the late-1970s, hoping to rap for the local DJs who performed and competed there, and the most popular one known to frequent the park was Jason Mizell, then known as \"Jazzy Jase\". Mizell was known for his flashy wardrobe and [[b-boy]] attitude, which led to minor legal troubles as a teen. Thereafter, he decided to pursue music fame and began entertaining in the park soon after. Eventually, Simmons and McDaniels rapped in front of Mizell at the park, and the three became friends. Following Russell's success managing Kurtis Blow, he helped Run record his first single, a song called \"Street Kid.\" The song went unnoticed, but despite the single's failure, Run's enthusiasm for hip hop was growing. Simmons soon wanted to record again\u2014-this time with McDaniels, but Russell refused, citing a dislike for D's rhyming style.<ref name=\"oldschoolhiphop profile\" /> After they graduated from high school and started college in 1982, Simmons and McDaniels finally convinced Russell to let them record as a duo, and they recruited Mizell (who was now known as Jam Master Jay) to be their official DJ. The following year, in 1983, Russell agreed to help them record a new single and land a record deal, but only after he changed McDaniels' stage name to his favourite car company, Delorean Motor Company 'DMC' and marketed the group as \"Run-D.M.C.\", a name which, incidentally, the group hated at first.

Emboldened by their success, Run-DMC released their eponymous debut album ''[[Run-D.M.C. (album)|Run-D.M.C.]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Hit singles such as \"Jam-Master Jay\" and \"Hard Times\" proved that the group were more than a [[one-hit wonder]], and the landmark single \"[[Rock Box]]\" was a groundbreaking fusion of raw hip hop and [[hard rock]] that would become a cornerstone of the group's sound and paved the way for the [[rap rock]] subgenre movement of the 1990s.\n\nRun-DMC's swift ascension to the forefront of rap with a new sound and style meant that [[old-school hip hop]] artists were becoming outdated. Along with pushing rap into a new direction musically, Run-DMC changed the entire aesthetic of hip hop music and culture. Old school rappers like [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Melle Mel]] of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] tended to dress in the flashy attire that was commonly attributed to glam rock and disco acts of the era: tight leather, chest-baring shirts, gloves and hats with rhinestones and spikes, leather boots, etc. Run-DMC discarded the more [[glam rock|glam]] aspects of early hip hop fashion (which were later readopted in 1990 by more \"pop\" rappers like [[MC Hammer]] and [[Vanilla Ice]]) and incorporated a more \"street\" sense of style such as [[Kangol]] hats, leather jackets, and unlaced [[Adidas]] shoes.<ref name=\"Winning\"/> The group's look had been heavily influenced by Mizell's own personal style. When Russell Simmons saw Jay's flashy, yet street b-boy style; he insisted the entire group follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458481/20021104/run_dmc.jhtml |title=DMC Speaks On Jam Master Jay's Role In The Run-DMC Legacy |publisher=MTV.com |date=November 4, 2002 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}</ref> Run said later:\n{{cquote|There were guys that wore hats like those and sneakers with no shoestrings. It was a very street thing to wear, extremely rough. They couldn't wear shoelaces in jail and we took it as a fashion statement. The reason they couldn't have shoelaces in jail was that they might hang themselves. That's why DMC says 'My Adidas only bring good news and they are not used as felon shoes.'<ref>[http://www.fattrak.com/run-dmc-slammed-the-1980s Run DMC Slammed The 1980's]</ref>}}\nThat embrace of the look and style of the street would define the next 25 years of hip hop fashion.\n\n===''King of Rock'', ''Raising Hell'' and mainstream success===\nAfter the success of their first album, Run-DMC looked to branch out on their follow-up. The release of ''[[King of Rock]]'' in 1985 saw the group furthering their rap rock fusion on songs like \"Can You Rock It Like This\" and the [[King of Rock (song)|title track]]; while \"Roots, Rap, Reggae\" was one of the first rap/dancehall hybrids. The [[music video]] for the single \"Rock Box\" was the first ever hip hop music video to be broadcast on [[MTV]] and received heavy rotation from the channel. The song was the group's most popular hit at that point and the album was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]]. Run-DMC performed at the legendary [[Live Aid]] benefit shortly after ''Rock Box'' was released.\n\nIn late-1985, Run-DMC were featured in the hip hop film ''[[Krush Groove]]'', a fictionalized retelling of [[Russell Simmons]]' rise as a hip hop entrepreneur and his struggles to get his own label, [[Def Jam Recordings]], off the ground.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The film featured a young [[Blair Underwood]] as Russell, along with appearances by old-school legend [[Kurtis Blow]], [[The Fat Boys]], teen pop act [[New Edition]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] protegee [[Sheila E.]], and hip hop's first successful [[White American|White]] rap group, the [[Beastie Boys]], who were signed to Simmons' Def Jam label. The film was a hit in cinemas and was further proof of hip hop's continued mainstream visibility.\n\nReturning to the studio in 1986, the group teamed with producer [[Rick Rubin]] for their third album. Rubin had just produced LL Cool J's debut album ''[[Radio (LL Cool J album)|Radio]]''. They later released their third album, titled ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'', which became the group's most successful album and one of the best-selling rap albums of all-time.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album was certified double-platinum and peaked at number three on the charts.\n\n[[File:Run\u2013D.M.C. - My Adidas-Peter Piper.jpg|thumb|12\" single cover for the group's single \"My Adidas\"]]\nThey were almost done with the album, but Rubin thought that it needed an element that would appeal to rock fans as well. This spurred the lead single \"[[Walk This Way#Run-D.M.C. version|Walk This Way]]\", a cover of the classic [[hard rock]] song by [[Aerosmith]]. The original intention was to just rap over a sample of the song, but Rubin and Jay insisted on doing a complete [[cover version]]. Aerosmith's [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] were called to join Run-DMC in the studio to add vocals and lead guitar, respectively<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anchor.fm/cover/episodes/Walk-This-Way-ec4c5j|title=Walk This Way by Uncovering the Cover \u2022 A podcast on Anchor|website=Anchor|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The group toured in the wake of the album's success, but the Raising Hell Tour was marred by violence, particularly fights between rival street gangs in places like [[Los Angeles]]. Though Run-DMC's lyrics had been angry, confrontational and aggressive, they typically denounced crime and ignorance, but the media began to blame the group for the incidents. In the wake of the violence, Run-DMC would call for a day of peace between the gangs in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1987, following on from the Raising Hell Tour, Run-D.M.C embarked on the [[Together Forever Tour]] with the [[Beastie Boys]].\n\n===''Tougher Than Leather'', changing times===\nAfter spending 1987 on tour supporting ''Raising Hell'', Run-DMC released ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]'' in 1988. The album saw the group discarding much of their rap rock leanings for a grittier, more [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy sound. Despite not selling as well as its predecessor, the album boasted several strong singles, including: \"[[Run's House (song)|Run's House]]\", \"Beats to the Rhyme\", and \"Mary Mary.\" Though at the time considered a disappointing follow-up to the blockbuster ''Raising Hell'', the album has grown in stature. In the 2000 liner notes for the album's re-release, [[Chuck D.]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] would call the album \"...a spectacular performance against all odds and expectations.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiphopinjesmoel.com/forums/1/categories/2/topics/18425 |title=HIPHOPINJESMOEL&nbsp;\u2013 \"Tougher Than Leather\" Liner Notes by Chuck D |publisher=Hiphopinjesmoel.com |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070702081556/http://hiphopinjesmoel.com/forums/1/categories/2/topics/18425 |archivedate=July 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1988, the group made their second film appearance in ''[[Tougher Than Leather (film)|Tougher Than Leather]]'', a would-be crime caper that was directed by [[Rick Rubin]] and featured special guest performances by the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Slick Rick]]. The film bombed at the [[box office]], but strengthened the indirect relationship between Run-DMC and the Def Jam label. Though the group itself was never signed to the label, they were managed by Russell Simmons, produced by Rick Rubin (who was a co-founder of Def Jam, along with Simmons), and often shared [[concert tour]] spotlight with acts on the label's roster.\n\n[[File:Run\u2013D.M.C. - Faces-Back From Hell (test pressing single) (Side A).jpg|thumb|left|A [[White label|test pressing]] release for the single [[Faces (Run-D.M.C. song)|\"Faces\"]] from the album ''Back from Hell'']]\nAmidst the changing times and sliding sales, Run-DMC released ''[[Back from Hell]]'' in 1990. The album was the worst-reviewed of their career, as the group tried to re-create itself musically with ill-advised forays into [[new jack swing]] (a then-popular style of production that sonically merged hip hop and [[contemporary R&B]]) and sometimes-preachy lyrical content. The two singles released, the anti-drug, anti-crime song \"[[Pause (Run-D.M.C. song)|Pause]]\" and street narrative \"The Ave\", had little success, and the group began to look outdated. Reeling from their first taste of failure, personal problems began to surface for the trio. McDaniels, who had been a heavy [[alcoholic beverages|drinker]] in recent years, was losing control to [[alcoholism]]. Jay was involved in a life-threatening car accident and survived two gunshot wounds after an incident in 1990. In 1991, Simmons was charged with raping a college student in Ohio, though the charges were later dropped.<ref>Pringle, Gill.

Both Simmons and McDaniels joined the church, with Run becoming especially devoted following his legal troubles and the toll it took on his finances.<ref>Millner, Denene.

Building on the gritty sound of ''Tougher Than Leather'', and adding some subtle religious references, the album featured guest appearances and production by several hip hop notables (including [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]]). Buoyed by the title track and first single, the album entered the charts at #1 and #7 on the pop charts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEven though the album went platinum, the song proved to be their last hit. [[Jam Master Jay]] also found success on his own; he had founded his own label [[JMJ Records]], and discovered and produced the group [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], which had tremendous success in 1993 following the release of their hit single, \"Slam.\" Later that same year, Run became an ordained minister, and in 1995 the iconic group appeared in ''[[The Show (1995 film)|The Show]]'', a Def Jam-produced [[documentary film|documentary]] that featured several of hip hop's biggest acts discussing the lifestyle and sacrifices of the industry.\n\n===Later years, Mizell's murder and break-up===\nOver the next few years, the group did very little recording. Mizell produced and mentored up and coming artists, including [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]] and [[50 Cent]], who he eventually signed to the JMJ label. Simmons got divorced, remarried, and began to focus on his spiritual and philanthropic endeavors by becoming a reverend. He also wrote a book alongside his brother Russell.<ref name=\"Winning\"/> McDaniels, also married, made an appearance on the [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s 1997 double-album ''[[Life After Death]]'', and focused on raising his family.\n\nThough the group continued to tour around the world, over a decade of living a rap superstar lifestyle was beginning to take a toll on McDaniels. He was beginning to tire of Run-DMC, and there was increased friction between him and Simmons, who was eager to return to recording (Simmons had at this time adopted the moniker '''Rev Run''' in light of his religious conversion). While on tour in [[Europe]] in 1997, McDaniels' ongoing battle with substance abuse led to a bout of severe [[clinical depression|depression]], which spurred an addiction to prescription drugs. McDaniels' depression continued for years, so much so that he contemplated suicide.<ref>Wells, Christina.

Nevins' remix of \"It's Like That\" hit number 1 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and many other European countries. A video was made for \"It's Like That\", although no new footage of Run-DMC appeared in it. In 1999, Run-DMC recorded the theme song for [[WWE|WWF]] wrestling stable [[D-Generation X]] entitled \"The Kings\", which appeared on the ''[[WWF Aggression]]'' album. They also made an appearance in a rare version of the music video \"[[Bodyrock (song)|Bodyrock]]\" by [[Moby]].\n\nSoon after, the group finally returned to the studio, but in an increasingly tense environment, as Simmons and McDaniels' differences had begun to show. In the wake of the exploding popularity of rap-rock artists like [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Kid Rock]], Simmons wanted to return to the aggressive, hard rock-tinged sound that made the group famous. McDaniels \u2014 who had become a fan of thoughtful [[singer-songwriters]] like [[John Lennon]], [[Harry Chapin]], and [[Sarah McLachlan]] \u2014 wanted to go in a more introspective direction. Appearing on [[VH1]]'s documentary series ''[[Behind the Music]]'' in early 2000, McDaniels confirmed that he was creatively frustrated and highlighted some songs that he was recording on his own. The continued friction led to McDaniels sitting out most of the group's recording sessions in protest.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Run\u2013D.M.C. - Crown Royal-Queens Day (single) (Side A).jpg|thumb|A single from Run-DMC's final album ''Crown Royal'']]\nSimmons, in defiance, recorded material anyway, inviting several guest stars such as Kid Rock, Jermaine Dupri, Adrian Burley, Tony Fredianelli and Stephan Jenkins of [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Method Man]], and fellow Queens MCs [[Nas]] and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]] to contribute to the project. The resulting album, ''[[Crown Royal (album)|Crown Royal]]'', was delayed due to the personal problems, and when it was finally released in 2001, it featured only three appearances by DMC. Despite no major singles, the album initially sold well. However, many critics{{who|date=December 2017}} blasted the lack of DMC's involvement.

The tour was a rousing success, celebrating the collaboration between the two acts and acknowledging the innumerable rap and rock acts that had been influenced by their seminal hit 15 years prior.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Even though he had little to do with the album, McDaniels was relishing the stage; he had been suffering from an inoperable vocal disorder that had rendered his once-booming voice a strained mumble.

There was even talk of Run-DMC finally signing with Def Jam, which by then was no longer held by its original founders.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Simmons, however, had been growing increasingly tired of hip hop.

The [[Beastie Boys]] paid tribute. Simmons did not attend the show; he was recording his first solo album, ''[[Distortion (Joseph Simmons album)|Distortion]]''. McDaniels also released a solo album, ''[[Checks Thugs and Rock n Roll]]''. He had recently discovered that he was adopted, which led him to be the center of the VH1 program ''My Adoption Journey'', a documentary chronicling his re-connection with his biological family. McDaniels was also featured in the 2008 [[video game]], ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', making appearances in the songs \"Walk this Way\" and \"King of Rock\". He frequently contributed to VH1 programs such as the ''I Love The...'' series, and he released the song \"Rock Show\" featuring singer [[Stephan Jenkins]]. Simmons also turned to television, starring in ''[[Run's House]]'', a [[reality show]] that followed his life as a father and husband.\n\nIn June 2007, McDaniels appeared with Aerosmith performing \"Walk This Way\" for their encore at the Hard Rock Calling festival in London.

[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p121003/biography|pure_url=yes}} Run-D.M.C. Biography] at Allmusic.com</ref> Musically, they moved hip hop and rap music away from the funk and disco-oriented sound of its beginnings, into an altogether new and unique sonic imprint. Their sound is directly responsible for intentionally transforming rap music from dance-and club-oriented funk grooves like \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\" and \"[[The Breaks (song)|The Breaks]]\" to an aggressive, less-danceable approach. Characterized by sparse, hard-hitting beats\u2014as typified on hits like \"[[It's like That (Run-D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]\", and \"[[Peter Piper (song)|Peter Piper]]\"\u2014this would form the foundation of [[hardcore hip hop]] (particularly hardcore [[East Coast hip hop]]). As such, Run-DMC is considered the originators of the style, and hardcore hip hop would dominate the next two decades of rap music, from the bombastic, noisy sound of Public Enemy and stripped minimalism of [[Boogie Down Productions]] to the thump of early [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Nas]]. Their influence was not limited to the East Coast, however. Los Angeles' [[N.W.A]], on their landmark 1988 album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', showed heavy influences from ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]''-era Run-DMC, and [[Chicano]] rap act [[Cypress Hill]] were definitely influenced by Run-DMC's fusion of rap and rock.\n\nEarly on, the group rarely sampled and rarely looped anything over their skeletal beats, and the funky minimalism of major producers, such as [[Timbaland]] and [[The Neptunes]], is drawn from Run-DMC's fundamental sound.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Rap rock]] fusion proved to be influential among rock artists, with '80s bands like [[Faith No More]], and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] adding elements of rap to [[alternative rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Most notably, the rap rock genre became popular in the late 1990s, with bands like [[Urban Dance Squad]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[KoRn]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Linkin Park]]. Aesthetically, they changed the way rappers presented themselves. Onstage, [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] rappers had previously performed in flashy attire and colorful costumes, typically had a live band and, in the case of acts like [[Whodini]], had background dancers. Run-DMC performed with only Run and DMC out front, and Jam-Master Jay on the turntables behind them, in what is now considered the 'classic' hip hop stage setup: two turntables and microphones. They embraced the look and style of the street by wearing jeans, lace-less [[Adidas]] sneakers, and their trademark black [[fedora]]s. The group shunned both the over-the-top wardrobe of previous rap stars like [[the Furious Five]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], ''and'' the silk-shirted, [[jheri curl]]ed, ladies' man look of rappers like [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Spoonie Gee]]. Followers of their style included LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys; seemingly overnight, rappers were wearing jeans and sneakers instead of rhinestones and leather outfits. From Adidas [[tracksuit]]s and rope chains to baggy jeans and [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] footwear, hip hop's look remained married to the styles of the street. According to the ''[[Rolling Stone]] Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'':\n{{cquote|Run-D.M.C. took hardcore hip-hop from an underground street sensation to a pop-culture phenomenon. Although earlier artists, such as [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[The Sugarhill Gang]], made rap's initial strides on the airwaves, it was Run-D.M.C. that introduced hats, gold chains, and untied sneakers to youth culture's most stubborn demographic group: young white male suburban rock fans. In the process, the trio helped change the course of popular music, paving the way for rap's second generation.<ref name=\"RS biography\" />}}\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them number 48 in their list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\".<ref name=\"stone\" /> In 2007, Run-DMC was named \"The Greatest Hip Hop Group of All Time\" by MTV.com and \"Greatest Hip Hop Artist of All Time\" by [[VH1]].<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\"mtv.com\" /> In 2009, Run-DMC became the second hip hop group to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|title=Run-DMC|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/run-dmc|website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> In 2016, Run-DMC received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHistorically, the group achieved a number of ''notable firsts'' in hip hop music and are credited with being the act most responsible for pushing hip hop into mainstream popular music, initiating its musical and artistic evolution and enabling its growth as a global phenomenon.

Simmons appeared onstage as a [[DJ]] for solo rapper [[Kurtis Blow]], who was managed by Russell. Known as \"DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow\", Simmons soon began performing with Kurtis Blow.<ref name=\"oldschoolhiphop profile\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/emcees/rundmc.htm|title=Run DMC Biography |website=OldSchoolHipHop.com}}</ref> Previously, McDaniels had been more focused on athletics than music, but soon began to DJ after purchasing a set of [[Phonograph|turntables]]. Simmons convinced McDaniels to start rapping, and though McDaniels would not perform in public, he soon began writing rhymes and was known as \"Easy D.\"\n\nSimmons and McDaniels started hanging around Two-Fifths Park in Hollis in the late-1970s, hoping to rap for the local DJs who performed and competed there, and the most popular one known to frequent the park was Jason Mizell, then known as \"Jazzy Jase\". Mizell was known for his flashy wardrobe and [[b-boy]] attitude, which led to minor legal troubles as a teen. Thereafter, he decided to pursue music fame and began entertaining in the park soon after. Eventually, Simmons and McDaniels rapped in front of Mizell at the park, and the three became friends. Following Russell's success managing Kurtis Blow, he helped Run record his first single, a song called \"Street Kid.\" The song went unnoticed, but despite the single's failure, Run's enthusiasm for hip hop was growing. Simmons soon wanted to record again\u2014-this time with McDaniels, but Russell refused, citing a dislike for D's rhyming style.<ref name=\"oldschoolhiphop profile\" /> After they graduated from high school and started college in 1982, Simmons and McDaniels finally convinced Russell to let them record as a duo, and they recruited Mizell (who was now known as Jam Master Jay) to be their official DJ. The following year, in 1983, Russell agreed to help them record a new single and land a record deal, but only after he changed McDaniels' stage name to his favourite car company, Delorean Motor Company 'DMC' and marketed the group as \"Run-D.M.C.\", a name which, incidentally, the group hated at first.

The [[music video]] for the single \"Rock Box\" was the first ever hip hop music video to be broadcast on [[MTV]] and received heavy rotation from the channel. The song was the group's most popular hit at that point and the album was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]]. Run-DMC performed at the legendary [[Live Aid]] benefit shortly after ''Rock Box'' was released.\n\nIn late-1985, Run-DMC were featured in the hip hop film ''[[Krush Groove]]'', a fictionalized retelling of [[Russell Simmons]]' rise as a hip hop entrepreneur and his struggles to get his own label, [[Def Jam Recordings]], off the ground.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The film featured a young [[Blair Underwood]] as Russell, along with appearances by old-school legend [[Kurtis Blow]], [[The Fat Boys]], teen pop act [[New Edition]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] protegee [[Sheila E.]], and hip hop's first successful [[White American|White]] rap group, the [[Beastie Boys]], who were signed to Simmons' Def Jam label. The film was a hit in cinemas and was further proof of hip hop's continued mainstream visibility.\n\nReturning to the studio in 1986, the group teamed with producer [[Rick Rubin]] for their third album. Rubin had just produced LL Cool J's debut album ''[[Radio (LL Cool J album)|Radio]]''. They later released their third album, titled ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'', which became the group's most successful album and one of the best-selling rap albums of all-time.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The album was certified double-platinum and peaked at number three on the charts.\n\n[[File:Run\u2013D.M.C. - My Adidas-Peter Piper.jpg|thumb|12\" single cover for the group's single \"My Adidas\"]]\nThey were almost done with the album, but Rubin thought that it needed an element that would appeal to rock fans as well. This spurred the lead single \"[[Walk This Way#Run-D.M.C. version|Walk This Way]]\", a cover of the classic [[hard rock]] song by [[Aerosmith]]. The original intention was to just rap over a sample of the song, but Rubin and Jay insisted on doing a complete [[cover version]]. Aerosmith's [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] were called to join Run-DMC in the studio to add vocals and lead guitar, respectively<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anchor.fm/cover/episodes/Walk-This-Way-ec4c5j|title=Walk This Way by Uncovering the Cover \u2022 A podcast on Anchor|website=Anchor|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. The song and video became one of the biggest hits of the 1980s, reaching #4 on the Hot 100, and cemented Run-DMC's crossover status. It also resurrected Aerosmith's career.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | title = Hall of Fame: Run-DMC bring rap to the masses | journal = REMIX, Electronic \u2022 Urban}}</ref> The single \"[[My Adidas]]\" led to the group signing a $1,600,000 endorsement deal with athletic apparel brand Adidas.

The group toured in the wake of the album's success, but the Raising Hell Tour was marred by violence, particularly fights between rival street gangs in places like [[Los Angeles]]. Though Run-DMC's lyrics had been angry, confrontational and aggressive, they typically denounced crime and ignorance, but the media began to blame the group for the incidents. In the wake of the violence, Run-DMC would call for a day of peace between the gangs in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1987, following on from the Raising Hell Tour, Run-D.M.C embarked on the [[Together Forever Tour]] with the [[Beastie Boys]].\n\n===''Tougher Than Leather'', changing times===\nAfter spending 1987 on tour supporting ''Raising Hell'', Run-DMC released ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]'' in 1988. The album saw the group discarding much of their rap rock leanings for a grittier, more [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy sound. Despite not selling as well as its predecessor, the album boasted several strong singles, including: \"[[Run's House (song)|Run's House]]\", \"Beats to the Rhyme\", and \"Mary Mary.\" Though at the time considered a disappointing follow-up to the blockbuster ''Raising Hell'', the album has grown in stature. In the 2000 liner notes for the album's re-release, [[Chuck D.]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] would call the album \"...a spectacular performance against all odds and expectations.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiphopinjesmoel.com/forums/1/categories/2/topics/18425 |title=HIPHOPINJESMOEL&nbsp;\u2013 \"Tougher Than Leather\" Liner Notes by Chuck D |publisher=Hiphopinjesmoel.com |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070702081556/http://hiphopinjesmoel.com/forums/1/categories/2/topics/18425 |archivedate=July 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1988, the group made their second film appearance in ''[[Tougher Than Leather (film)|Tougher Than Leather]]'', a would-be crime caper that was directed by [[Rick Rubin]] and featured special guest performances by the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Slick Rick]]. The film bombed at the [[box office]], but strengthened the indirect relationship between Run-DMC and the Def Jam label. Though the group itself was never signed to the label, they were managed by Russell Simmons, produced by Rick Rubin (who was a co-founder of Def Jam, along with Simmons), and often shared [[concert tour]] spotlight with acts on the label's roster.\n\n[[File:Run\u2013D.M.C. - Faces-Back From Hell (test pressing single) (Side A).jpg|thumb|left|A [[White label|test pressing]] release for the single [[Faces (Run-D.M.C. song)|\"Faces\"]] from the album ''Back from Hell'']]\nAmidst the changing times and sliding sales, Run-DMC released ''[[Back from Hell]]'' in 1990. The album was the worst-reviewed of their career, as the group tried to re-create itself musically with ill-advised forays into [[new jack swing]] (a then-popular style of production that sonically merged hip hop and [[contemporary R&B]]) and sometimes-preachy lyrical content. The two singles released, the anti-drug, anti-crime song \"[[Pause (Run-D.M.C. song)|Pause]]\" and street narrative \"The Ave\", had little success, and the group began to look outdated. Reeling from their first taste of failure, personal problems began to surface for the trio. McDaniels, who had been a heavy [[alcoholic beverages|drinker]] in recent years, was losing control to [[alcoholism]]. Jay was involved in a life-threatening car accident and survived two gunshot wounds after an incident in 1990. In 1991, Simmons was charged with raping a college student in Ohio, though the charges were later dropped.<ref>Pringle, Gill. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/reverend-run-pray-this-way-481409.html \"Reverend Run: Pray this way\"], ''The Independent'', 7 June 2006.</ref>\n\nWith so much personal chaos and professional uncertainty, the members turned to faith to try to steady their lives. Both Simmons and McDaniels joined the church, with Run becoming especially devoted following his legal troubles and the toll it took on his finances.<ref>Millner, Denene.

Run&nbsp;\u2014 For His New Life Rapper's Delight Now Religion\"], ''New York Daily News'', 10 October 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus that seemingly saw rap music move on without them, the rejuvenated Run-DMC returned in 1993 with ''[[Down with the King (album)|Down with the King]]''. Building on the gritty sound of ''Tougher Than Leather'', and adding some subtle religious references, the album featured guest appearances and production by several hip hop notables (including [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]]). Buoyed by the title track and first single, the album entered the charts at #1 and #7 on the pop charts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEven though the album went platinum, the song proved to be their last hit. [[Jam Master Jay]] also found success on his own; he had founded his own label [[JMJ Records]], and discovered and produced the group [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], which had tremendous success in 1993 following the release of their hit single, \"Slam.\" Later that same year, Run became an ordained minister, and in 1995 the iconic group appeared in ''[[The Show (1995 film)|The Show]]'', a Def Jam-produced [[documentary film|documentary]] that featured several of hip hop's biggest acts discussing the lifestyle and sacrifices of the industry.\n\n===Later years, Mizell's murder and break-up===\nOver the next few years, the group did very little recording. Mizell produced and mentored up and coming artists, including [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]] and [[50 Cent]], who he eventually signed to the JMJ label. Simmons got divorced, remarried, and began to focus on his spiritual and philanthropic endeavors by becoming a reverend. He also wrote a book alongside his brother Russell.<ref name=\"Winning\"/> McDaniels, also married, made an appearance on the [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s 1997 double-album ''[[Life After Death]]'', and focused on raising his family.\n\nThough the group continued to tour around the world, over a decade of living a rap superstar lifestyle was beginning to take a toll on McDaniels. He was beginning to tire of Run-DMC, and there was increased friction between him and Simmons, who was eager to return to recording (Simmons had at this time adopted the moniker '''Rev Run''' in light of his religious conversion). While on tour in [[Europe]] in 1997, McDaniels' ongoing battle with substance abuse led to a bout of severe [[clinical depression|depression]], which spurred an addiction to prescription drugs. McDaniels' depression continued for years, so much so that he contemplated suicide.<ref>Wells, Christina.

Nevins' remix of \"It's Like That\" hit number 1 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and many other European countries. A video was made for \"It's Like That\", although no new footage of Run-DMC appeared in it. In 1999, Run-DMC recorded the theme song for [[WWE|WWF]] wrestling stable [[D-Generation X]] entitled \"The Kings\", which appeared on the ''[[WWF Aggression]]'' album. They also made an appearance in a rare version of the music video \"[[Bodyrock (song)|Bodyrock]]\" by [[Moby]].\n\nSoon after, the group finally returned to the studio, but in an increasingly tense environment, as Simmons and McDaniels' differences had begun to show. In the wake of the exploding popularity of rap-rock artists like [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Kid Rock]], Simmons wanted to return to the aggressive, hard rock-tinged sound that made the group famous. McDaniels \u2014 who had become a fan of thoughtful [[singer-songwriters]] like [[John Lennon]], [[Harry Chapin]], and [[Sarah McLachlan]] \u2014 wanted to go in a more introspective direction. Appearing on [[VH1]]'s documentary series ''[[Behind the Music]]'' in early 2000, McDaniels confirmed that he was creatively frustrated and highlighted some songs that he was recording on his own. The continued friction led to McDaniels sitting out most of the group's recording sessions in protest.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Run\u2013D.M.C. - Crown Royal-Queens Day (single) (Side A).jpg|thumb|A single from Run-DMC's final album ''Crown Royal'']]\nSimmons, in defiance, recorded material anyway, inviting several guest stars such as Kid Rock, Jermaine Dupri, Adrian Burley, Tony Fredianelli and Stephan Jenkins of [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Method Man]], and fellow Queens MCs [[Nas]] and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]] to contribute to the project. The resulting album, ''[[Crown Royal (album)|Crown Royal]]'', was delayed due to the personal problems, and when it was finally released in 2001, it featured only three appearances by DMC. Despite no major singles, the album initially sold well. However, many critics{{who|date=December 2017}} blasted the lack of DMC's involvement. Some positive reviews were published: ''Entertainment Weekly'' noted that \"on this hip hop roast, new schoolers Nas and [[Fat Joe]] pay their respects with sparkling grooves...Run's rhymes are still limber.\"<ref>Browne, David.

The tour was a rousing success, celebrating the collaboration between the two acts and acknowledging the innumerable rap and rock acts that had been influenced by their seminal hit 15 years prior.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Even though he had little to do with the album, McDaniels was relishing the stage; he had been suffering from an inoperable vocal disorder that had rendered his once-booming voice a strained mumble. Performing allowed McDaniels to come out of his depression and he appeared revitalized on the tour. There was even talk of Run-DMC finally signing with Def Jam, which by then was no longer held by its original founders.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Simmons, however, had been growing increasingly tired of hip hop. His family was growing, and he was assisting with his brother Russell's [[Phat Farm]] clothing imprint, making Run-DMC less of a priority. Despite the success of the tour and Aerosmith consequently discussing adding additional dates, Simmons abruptly announced that he was quitting.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYeABqO42rAC&pg=PT322 |title=Raising Hell: The Reign, Ruin, and Redemption of Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay |isbn=9780060781958 |last1=Ro |first1=Ronin |date=October 18, 2005 }}</ref> \n\nOn October 30, 2002, Mizell was shot and killed at his recording studio in Queens.<ref name=cnn3>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/Northeast/10/31/run.dmc.killing/index.html |title=Run-DMC DJ slain in recording studio - Nov. 1, 2002 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Fans and friends set up a memorial outside the studio with Adidas sneakers, albums, and flowers.

The [[Beastie Boys]] paid tribute. Simmons did not attend the show; he was recording his first solo album, ''[[Distortion (Joseph Simmons album)|Distortion]]''. McDaniels also released a solo album, ''[[Checks Thugs and Rock n Roll]]''. He had recently discovered that he was adopted, which led him to be the center of the VH1 program ''My Adoption Journey'', a documentary chronicling his re-connection with his biological family. McDaniels was also featured in the 2008 [[video game]], ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', making appearances in the songs \"Walk this Way\" and \"King of Rock\". He frequently contributed to VH1 programs such as the ''I Love The...'' series, and he released the song \"Rock Show\" featuring singer [[Stephan Jenkins]]. Simmons also turned to television, starring in ''[[Run's House]]'', a [[reality show]] that followed his life as a father and husband.\n\nIn June 2007, McDaniels appeared with Aerosmith performing \"Walk This Way\" for their encore at the Hard Rock Calling festival in London. Simmons joined [[Kid Rock]]'s 2008 Rock N Roll Revival Tour, performing \"It's Like That\", \"It's Tricky\", \"You Be Illin'\", \"Run's House\", \"Here We Go\", \"King of Rock\" and \"Walk This Way\" with Kid Rock. They also [[cover version|cover]]ed \"For What It's Worth\" at the end of the show. In 2007, Mizell's wife, Terry, Simmons, and McDaniels also launched the [[J.A.M. Awards]] in Jay's memory.

[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p121003/biography|pure_url=yes}} Run-D.M.C. Biography] at Allmusic.com</ref> Musically, they moved hip hop and rap music away from the funk and disco-oriented sound of its beginnings, into an altogether new and unique sonic imprint. Their sound is directly responsible for intentionally transforming rap music from dance-and club-oriented funk grooves like \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\" and \"[[The Breaks (song)|The Breaks]]\" to an aggressive, less-danceable approach. Characterized by sparse, hard-hitting beats\u2014as typified on hits like \"[[It's like That (Run-D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]\", and \"[[Peter Piper (song)|Peter Piper]]\"\u2014this would form the foundation of [[hardcore hip hop]] (particularly hardcore [[East Coast hip hop]]). As such, Run-DMC is considered the originators of the style, and hardcore hip hop would dominate the next two decades of rap music, from the bombastic, noisy sound of Public Enemy and stripped minimalism of [[Boogie Down Productions]] to the thump of early [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Nas]]. Their influence was not limited to the East Coast, however. Los Angeles' [[N.W.A]], on their landmark 1988 album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', showed heavy influences from ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]''-era Run-DMC, and [[Chicano]] rap act [[Cypress Hill]] were definitely influenced by Run-DMC's fusion of rap and rock.\n\nEarly on, the group rarely sampled and rarely looped anything over their skeletal beats, and the funky minimalism of major producers, such as [[Timbaland]] and [[The Neptunes]], is drawn from Run-DMC's fundamental sound.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Rap rock]] fusion proved to be influential among rock artists, with '80s bands like [[Faith No More]], and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] adding elements of rap to [[alternative rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Most notably, the rap rock genre became popular in the late 1990s, with bands like [[Urban Dance Squad]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[KoRn]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Linkin Park]]. Aesthetically, they changed the way rappers presented themselves. Onstage, [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] rappers had previously performed in flashy attire and colorful costumes, typically had a live band and, in the case of acts like [[Whodini]], had background dancers. Run-DMC performed with only Run and DMC out front, and Jam-Master Jay on the turntables behind them, in what is now considered the 'classic' hip hop stage setup: two turntables and microphones. They embraced the look and style of the street by wearing jeans, lace-less [[Adidas]] sneakers, and their trademark black [[fedora]]s. The group shunned both the over-the-top wardrobe of previous rap stars like [[the Furious Five]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], ''and'' the silk-shirted, [[jheri curl]]ed, ladies' man look of rappers like [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Spoonie Gee]]. Followers of their style included LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys; seemingly overnight, rappers were wearing jeans and sneakers instead of rhinestones and leather outfits. From Adidas [[tracksuit]]s and rope chains to baggy jeans and [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] footwear, hip hop's look remained married to the styles of the street. According to the ''[[Rolling Stone]] Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'':\n{{cquote|Run-D.M.C. took hardcore hip-hop from an underground street sensation to a pop-culture phenomenon. Although earlier artists, such as [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[The Sugarhill Gang]], made rap's initial strides on the airwaves, it was Run-D.M.C. that introduced hats, gold chains, and untied sneakers to youth culture's most stubborn demographic group: young white male suburban rock fans.
