The DFL was founded in 1944 when the Minnesota Democratic Party and [[Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] merged. The party is affiliated with the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Supporters of the DFL are often referred to as \"DFLers\" in Minnesota by both members and non-members of the party as an alternative to \"Democrats.\" The state Republican Party is affiliated with the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Long-term trends==\n{{POV|date=February 2019}}\n\nHistorian Annette Atkins has explored the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms. Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer\u2013Labor party in the 1930s. Isolationism was strong, Adkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s.  In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened. Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength. Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where half the people live. The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue. State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship. Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists. Adkins finds that:\n: What makes the North country valuable to conservationists is the seclusion, beauty, isolation, quiet, clear water, and absence of development. The preservationists have tried to limit or prohibit roads, hydroelectric generators, sawmills and lumbering, resorts, power boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles\u2026. The tensions between development and preservation, restraint and growth, beauty and jobs runs deep and strong.<ref>Annette Atkins, \"Minnesota,\" in James H.

Pillsbury]] (July 29, 1828 \u2013 October 18, 1901) served as the 8th [[Governor of Minnesota]] from January 7, 1876 to January 10, 1882. Pillsbury was a noted philanthropist and often anonymously donated funds to causes he favored. In particular, he helped the [[University of Minnesota]] recover from debt in its early years, and later served as a [[Board of regents|regent]]. Since then, he has become known as \"The Father of the University\". Pillsbury Hall at the University of Minnesota is named in his honor. He tried his hand at several different types of businesses, including hardware, real estate and lumber, though his greatest success came when he founded [[Pillsbury Company|C.A.

He was a delegate to the Fifth [[International Conference of American States]] at [[Santiago, Chile]] in 1923, and served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom from 1923 to 1925. He was [[United States Secretary of State]] in the Cabinet of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] 1925\u20131929. In 1928, he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] in Dublin, Ireland and in 1929 the government of France made him a member of the [[Legion of Honor]]. As Secretary of State, he coauthored the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], signed in 1928. Proposed by its other namesake, French foreign minister [[Aristide Briand]], the treaty intended to provide for \"the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.\" He was awarded the 1929 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition. He was associate judge of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] from 1930 to 1935.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n[[File:MNFloydOlson.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Floyd B.

He was a member of the [[Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party]], and was the first member of the Farmer\u2013Labor Party to win the office of governor in Minnesota. The party, founded in 1918 had a good deal of success in Minnesota as a statewide third party, with three governors and four U.S. senators serving during the 1920s and 1930s. The party platform called for protection for farmers and labor union members, government ownership of some industries, and social security laws. There were unsuccessful attempts to develop the party into a national Farmer\u2013Labor Party in the early 1920s.<ref>{{cite web| last = Davenport| first = Tim| title = The Farmer\u2013Labor Party (1918\u20131924)| work=Early American Marxism| publisher=marxisthistory.org| url = http://marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/farmerlaborparty.html| accessdate =December 4, 2006}}</ref> The Minnesota Democratic Party, led by Hubert H.

Stassen]] (April 13, 1907 \u2013 March 4, 2001) was the 25th [[Governor of Minnesota]] from 1939 to 1943 and a later [[perennial candidate]] for other offices, most notably and frequently President of the United States. At 31 he was the youngest governor to serve in Minnesota and was seen as an \"up and comer\" after delivering the [[keynote]] address at the 1940 Republican National Convention. At that convention, he helped secure the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination for [[Wendell Willkie]]. Stassen was a delegate at the San Francisco [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|Conference]] that established the United Nations, and president of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1948 to 1953.\n\nStassen was later best known for being a perennial candidate for the Republican Party nomination for president. His strongest bid for the presidential nomination was in 1948, when he won a series of upset victories in early [[Primary election|primaries]]. Polls showed that he would beat [[Harry S. Truman]] if nominated. He lost the nomination to [[Thomas Dewey]], however, who had already lost in the presidential election of 1944 to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Stassen played a key role in the 1952 Republican contest when he released his delegates to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  This helped Eisenhower to defeat [[Robert A. Taft]] on the first ballot. He served in the Eisenhower Administration, filling posts including director of the Mutual Security Administration (foreign aid) and Special Assistant to the President for Disarmament. During this period he held cabinet rank and led a [[Quixotism|quixotic]] effort to \"dump [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]\" at the [[1956 Republican National Convention]]. Stassen gained a reputation as a [[American liberalism|liberal]], particularly when, as president of the [[American Baptist Convention]] in 1963, he joined [[Martin Luther King]] in his march on Washington, D.C. He was a prime representative of the socially-progressive \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\" wing of American Republicanism.\n{{clear|left}}\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|[[Hubert Humphrey]]|thumb|left|100px]]\n\n===Hubert Humphrey===\n[[Hubert Humphrey]] (May 27, 1911 \u2013 January 13, 1978) was the 38th Vice President of the United States, serving under President [[Lyndon Johnson]].

He was a founder of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] and [[Americans for Democratic Action]]. He served as mayor of [[Minneapolis]] from July 2, 1945 to November 30, 1948. In 1968 Humphrey was the nominee of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|United States presidential election]] but lost to Republican [[Richard M. Nixon]]. In one of the most renowned speeches in American political history, Humphrey told the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]: \"the time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadows of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights,\" winning support for a pro-civil-rights plank in the Party's platform.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n[[File:EugeneMcCarthy.jpg|[[Eugene McCarthy]]|thumb|left|100px]]\n\n===Eugene McCarthy===\n[[Eugene McCarthy]] (March 29, 1916 \u2013 December 10, 2005) was a longtime member of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]].

His anti-war stance and popularity prior to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] likely convinced [[Lyndon Johnson]] to drop out of the [[1968 United States presidential election|race]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], McCarthy unsuccessfully sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for President of the United States to succeed incumbent Lyndon Johnson on an anti-[[Vietnam War]] platform.

In the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998]] he was elected the 38th [[Governor of Minnesota]] and served from January 4, 1999 to January 6, 2003 without seeking a second term.

Supporters of the DFL are often referred to as \"DFLers\" in Minnesota by both members and non-members of the party as an alternative to \"Democrats.\" The state Republican Party is affiliated with the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Long-term trends==\n{{POV|date=February 2019}}\n\nHistorian Annette Atkins has explored the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms. Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer\u2013Labor party in the 1930s. Isolationism was strong, Adkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s.  In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened. Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength. Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where half the people live. The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue. State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship. Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists. Adkins finds that:\n: What makes the North country valuable to conservationists is the seclusion, beauty, isolation, quiet, clear water, and absence of development. The preservationists have tried to limit or prohibit roads, hydroelectric generators, sawmills and lumbering, resorts, power boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles\u2026. The tensions between development and preservation, restraint and growth, beauty and jobs runs deep and strong.<ref>Annette Atkins, \"Minnesota,\" in James H.

Pillsbury was a noted philanthropist and often anonymously donated funds to causes he favored. In particular, he helped the [[University of Minnesota]] recover from debt in its early years, and later served as a [[Board of regents|regent]]. Since then, he has become known as \"The Father of the University\". Pillsbury Hall at the University of Minnesota is named in his honor.

At 31 he was the youngest governor to serve in Minnesota and was seen as an \"up and comer\" after delivering the [[keynote]] address at the 1940 Republican National Convention. At that convention, he helped secure the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination for [[Wendell Willkie]].

His strongest bid for the presidential nomination was in 1948, when he won a series of upset victories in early [[Primary election|primaries]]. Polls showed that he would beat [[Harry S.

Stassen played a key role in the 1952 Republican contest when he released his delegates to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  This helped Eisenhower to defeat [[Robert A. Taft]] on the first ballot. He served in the Eisenhower Administration, filling posts including director of the Mutual Security Administration (foreign aid) and Special Assistant to the President for Disarmament. During this period he held cabinet rank and led a [[Quixotism|quixotic]] effort to \"dump [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]\" at the [[1956 Republican National Convention]]. Stassen gained a reputation as a [[American liberalism|liberal]], particularly when, as president of the [[American Baptist Convention]] in 1963, he joined [[Martin Luther King]] in his march on Washington, D.C.

In the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998]] he was elected the 38th [[Governor of Minnesota]] and served from January 4, 1999 to January 6, 2003 without seeking a second term. Ventura ran as a candidate for the [[Reform Party of Minnesota]] (but joined the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] when it broke from its association with the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]]) and narrowly, but unexpectedly beat the major-party candidates: [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]] ([[Republican Party of Minnesota|Republican]]) and [[Minnesota]] Attorney General [[Skip Humphrey|Hubert H. \"Skip\" Humphrey III]] ([[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor]]). Ventura went on to gain the highest approval rating of any governor in Minnesota history, with some polls ranking his public approval as high as the 73% in 1999, despite controversial statements of his. His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive grassroots events and original television spots, designed by quirky advertising man [[Bill Hillsman]], using the phrase \"Don't vote for politics as usual.\" He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $600,000), and is widely regarded as one of the first candidates to effectively use the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.<ref>{{cite paper| author=deFiebre, Conrad| title =Record-high job approval for Ventura; Many Minnesotans like his style, don't mind moonlighting| work=[[Star Tribune]]| date =July 22, 1999}}</ref>\n\n==Historically progressive==\n{| align=\"right\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 79%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Later, he again played himself on another [[Not All Dogs Go to Heaven|''Family Guy'' episode]], where all seven main TNG actors (plus [[Denise Crosby]] and [[Wil Wheaton]]) made voice appearances. He is also one of six Star Trek actors (the other actors being [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[George Takei]], [[Avery Brooks]] and [[Majel Barrett]]) to lend their voices to the video game ''Star Trek: Captain's Chair,'' reprising his role as Riker when users visit the ''Enterprise''-D bridge featured in the game. \n\nMuch of Frakes acting work after ''Star Trek'' has been [[animation]] [[voice acting]], most notably voicing the recurring role of [[David Xanatos]] in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', and he provided the voice of his own head in a jar in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]\". He had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 movie ''[[Camp Nowhere]]''.

His relationship with ''Star Trek'' is made light of in the [[List of Roswell episodes#Season 3 (2001\u201302)|season 3 episode]] \"Secrets and Lies\", in which the alien character [[Max Evans (Roswell)|Max]] auditions for a guest role as an alien for ''Star Trek: Enterprise''.\n\nFrakes appeared on the 1994 [[Phish]] album ''[[Hoist (album)|Hoist]]'', playing [[trombone]] on the track titled \"Riker's Mailbox\".

He was also a member of \"The Sunspots\", a vocal backup group of ''Star Trek'' cast members that appeared on [[Brent Spiner]]'s 1991 album ''[[Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back]]''.\n\nFrakes hosted ''The Paranormal Borderline'', a television series on [[UPN]], which dealt with the paranormal and mysterious happenings and creatures.

The \"Snowwalker\" footage, as it is known, purportedly shows a yeti crossing through a valley in the Himalayas, walking in front of a Belgian couple who are traversing the area on skis. The network finally admitted the hoax, and Frakes distanced himself from the show. He hosted ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]],'' which also dealt with the paranormal world.\n\nFrakes and Francis appeared together in ''[[Lois & Clark]]'' in the episode \"Don't Tug on Superman's Cape\" as a creepily too-good-to-be-true couple.

He has also directed episodes in five of the series (''TNG'', ''DS9,'' ''VOY'', ''DIS'', and ''PIC''). \n\nHe also reprised his role of Riker for a ''Next Generation'' cutaway on [[Peter's Got Woods|an episode of ''Family Guy'']] that also featured his co-stars [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Michael Dorn]] as their respective roles of [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] and [[Worf]]. Later, he again played himself on another [[Not All Dogs Go to Heaven|''Family Guy'' episode]], where all seven main TNG actors (plus [[Denise Crosby]] and [[Wil Wheaton]]) made voice appearances. He is also one of six Star Trek actors (the other actors being [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[George Takei]], [[Avery Brooks]] and [[Majel Barrett]]) to lend their voices to the video game ''Star Trek: Captain's Chair,'' reprising his role as Riker when users visit the ''Enterprise''-D bridge featured in the game. \n\nMuch of Frakes acting work after ''Star Trek'' has been [[animation]] [[voice acting]], most notably voicing the recurring role of [[David Xanatos]] in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', and he provided the voice of his own head in a jar in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]\". He had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 movie ''[[Camp Nowhere]]''. Frakes was also the voice of [[Finn the Human]]'s adult version in the episodes \"Puhoy\" and \"Dungeon Train\" on ''[[Adventure Time]]''.\n\nFrakes was an executive producer for the WB series ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', directed several episodes, and guest-starred in three episodes. His relationship with ''Star Trek'' is made light of in the [[List of Roswell episodes#Season 3 (2001\u201302)|season 3 episode]] \"Secrets and Lies\", in which the alien character [[Max Evans (Roswell)|Max]] auditions for a guest role as an alien for ''Star Trek: Enterprise''.\n\nFrakes appeared on the 1994 [[Phish]] album ''[[Hoist (album)|Hoist]]'', playing [[trombone]] on the track titled \"Riker's Mailbox\". Frakes would occasionally perform on the trombone during his tenure as Commander Riker, drawing on his college marching band experience. He was also a member of \"The Sunspots\", a vocal backup group of ''Star Trek'' cast members that appeared on [[Brent Spiner]]'s 1991 album ''[[Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back]]''.\n\nFrakes hosted ''The Paranormal Borderline'', a television series on [[UPN]], which dealt with the paranormal and mysterious happenings and creatures. In one episode, Frakes presented an interview of reporter Yolanda Gaskins with veteran astronaut [[Gordon Cooper]], where they discussed the possibility of aliens having visited Earth in the past.<ref>{{YouTube|dvPR8T1o3Dc}}</ref><ref>[http://www.qtm.net/~geibdan/coop.html http://www.qtm.net/~geibdan/coop.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205120237/http://qtm.net/~geibdan/coop.html |date=2009-02-05 }} UFO Folklore Center \u2013 Transcript of Interview</ref> Overall, the show was criticized and pulled off the air after it was discovered that footage showing a yeti from the Himalayas was purposely faked by the show and its producers. The \"Snowwalker\" footage, as it is known, purportedly shows a yeti crossing through a valley in the Himalayas, walking in front of a Belgian couple who are traversing the area on skis. The network finally admitted the hoax, and Frakes distanced himself from the show. He hosted ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]],'' which also dealt with the paranormal world.\n\nFrakes and Francis appeared together in ''[[Lois & Clark]]'' in the episode \"Don't Tug on Superman's Cape\" as a creepily too-good-to-be-true couple.

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise. \n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel.

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise. \n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious and self-conscious around Dee. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago. Mama carried her out in her arms, as Dee watched the house burn. Dee was seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name, and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, nor does she ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs into the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama which develops into an argument between Mama and Dee. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined, and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Dee has a different mindset; she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\", whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. Mama believes the quilt should be used. Even if the quilts \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]], the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit, Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point, it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us. It is thought by some that Mama does not judge her children, Dee and Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being overweight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story, the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own shortcomings.  As the story concludes, the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very sentimental piece that holds great meaning and history behind it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Dee has a different mindset; she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\", whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. Mama believes the quilt should be used. Even if the quilts \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]], the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit, Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point, it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us. It is thought by some that Mama does not judge her children, Dee and Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being overweight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story, the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own shortcomings.  As the story concludes, the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.
