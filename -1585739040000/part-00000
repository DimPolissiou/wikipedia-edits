This marked the first time since 10 November 2003 that neither Federer nor Nadal was ranked in the ATP top 2 ([[Novak Djokovic]] had taken the number 1 spot in 2011),<ref><http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2013/03/13/Shark-Bites-Miami-Final-Murray.aspx></ref> a span of an unprecedented 490 weeks.\n\nDuring the clay-court season, Nadal defeated Federer in the final of the [[2013 Rome Masters|Rome Masters]] in two sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/05/19/rafael-nadal-roger-federer-italian-open/2323969/ |title= Nadal dominates Federer to win in Rome|date=19 May 2013|work=USA Today|access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the season, they met played in the quarterfinals at the [[2013 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Open]], where Nadal unseated the five-time champion in the quarterfinals in three sets. Federer had just switched back to his old racquet after experimenting with a larger frame in his previous two tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/beyond-baseline/2013/08/14/roger-federer-switching-to-old-racket|title=Roger Federer switching back to old racket through the U.S. Open|first=Courtney|last=Nguyen|date=|work=SI.com|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref> They next met in the semifinal of the [[2013 ATP World Tour Finals|World Tour Finals]] at the O2 arena, with Nadal prevailing in straight sets. This was Nadal's first win over Federer on indoor hard courts.  This would also be Federer's last career match played with his 90-inch racquet before upgrading to a larger frame.\n\n=== 2014: Australian Open ===\n\nFederer and Nadal had their only meeting of the 2014 season in the semifinal of the [[2014 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles|Australian Open]]. Nadal won in straight sets and improved his record to 3\u20130 against Federer at the Australian Open (9\u20132 overall in majors). This was the first Grand Slam tournament that Federer played after switching to a new larger racquet.\n\n=== 2015: Basel ===\n\nIn November 2015, Federer defeated Nadal in three sets in the final of the [[2015 Swiss Indoors|Swiss Indoors]]. This was their first encounter on Swiss soil, as Federer captured a seventh title in his hometown of [[Basel]]. It was Federer's first victory over Nadal in over 3 and a half years, having lost the previous five meetings.\n\n=== 2017: Australian Open, Indian Wells, Miami, Shanghai ===\n\n[[File:Australian Open 2017 Final - Roger Federer vs Rafa Nadel (32604614845).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Federer defeated Nadal to capture a record 18th Grand Slam title.]]\n\nFederer and Nadal played four times in 2017, with Federer prevailing on all four occasions. This marked the first time in their rivalry that Federer confronted and went undefeated against Nadal multiple times in a single tennis season.\n\nThe rivalry was renewed in the [[2017 Australian Open \u2013 Men's singles final|2017 Australian Open final]], their first meeting in a Grand Slam final since 2011. Federer, returning from a six-month layoff from knee injury that saw him miss out most of the 2016 season, came into the tournament seeded 17th, and Nadal was seeded 9th. Prior to the match, Nadal had won every match between the two in a Grand Slam tournament since the Wimbledon final in 2007, three of which were in the Australian Open. Federer came back from a break down in the fifth set to take the match, becoming the first man in history to win 18 Grand Slam singles titles and the first man to win at least five titles in three different Grand Slam tournaments each, and denying Nadal's third effort to win the Australian Open title again and also his second opportunity to become the first man in the Open Era to win each Grand Slam tournament in men's singles at least twice. Federer's victory over Nadal in the Australian Open 2017 final also marked his first win over Nadal in a Grand Slam singles match outside the grass courts of Wimbledon.\n\nThey met again at [[2017 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] in the round of 16, only their second-ever meeting before the quarterfinal stage in any tournament. Federer prevailed in straight sets; it was the first time he had won three matches in a row against Nadal. Their 37th meeting came in the [[2017 Miami Open|Miami]] final. This was their first meeting in a final on American soil since the 2005 Miami final, and Federer won in straight sets, his 4th consecutive win over Nadal.<!-- - DO NOT PUT SCORES IN PROSE - -->\n\nIn the [[2017 Laver Cup]] Nadal and Federer played doubles together for the first time, against [[Sam Querrey]]/[[Jack Sock]], and won in a match tiebreak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lavercup.com/news/2017/09/23/fedal-reign-supreme-doubles-court|title=FEDAL REIGN SUPREME ON THE DOUBLES COURT|website=www.lavercup.com|date = 23 September 2017|accessdate = 26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFederer and Nadal met at the [[2017 Shanghai Rolex Masters \u2013 Singles|Shanghai Masters]] for the first time, contesting the final. Federer won in straight sets, claiming a fifth consecutive win over Nadal. This was the first time they had contested a match as the top two ranked players in the world since the 2010 ATP Finals.\n\nFederer's newfound success against Nadal has been ascribed to the improvement in the backhand, which he has been hitting harder and more easily returning Nadal's high bouncing forehand with the larger racquet.<ref>{{cite news|author1=J.S.|title=Roger Federer has turned his weakest shot into a weapon|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2017/04/backhanded-complement|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2019: French Open, Wimbledon ===\nIn 2019 Federer and Nadal have met twice, with each one prevailing once.

This was a charity tennis match for the [[Fundaci\u00f3n Rafa Nadal]] (Rafael Nadal Foundation).\n\nOn 1 January 2011 they played in the final of the knockout exhibition tournament; the [[2011 Mubadala World Tennis Championship \u2013 Singles|Mubadala World Tennis Championship]] on a hard court. Federer had beaten S\u00f6derling in the previous round and Nadal had beaten Berdych in the previous round.

Federer won 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20133.\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n=== Significant aspects ===\n\nThe rivalry between Federer and Nadal has been a huge part of both men's careers. Their [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament histories are of particular interest, especially their all-time record of nine finals encounters.<ref name=\"atp-therivalry\"/> This includes playing French Open and Wimbledon finals for three consecutive years (2006\u201308), culminating in what many consider the greatest match in tennis history at Wimbledon 2008.<ref name=\"greatestmatchever\"/><ref name=\"McEnroe-greatestmatch\"/><ref name=\"wertheim-greatestmatch\"/><ref name=\"tignor-greatestmatch\"/> Nadal, who had to defeat Federer during each of his first six Grand Slam title runs, possesses a 6\u20133 advantage in their Grand Slam finals encounters as well as a 4\u20131 edge in semifinals.\n\nNadal denied Federer a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|Career Grand Slam]] plus two potential [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Players who completed the Grand Slam|Grand Slam]]s (2006\u201307) by defeating him at the French Open every year from 2005\u201308. Federer would complete a Career Grand Slam by winning the French title in 2009 after Nadal was upset in the fourth round. Meanwhile, Federer twice denied Nadal from becoming the first man since [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]] in 1980 to win the \"Channel Slam\" (both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year) by defeating him in their first two Wimbledon finals, but Nadal succeeded the following year by defeating Federer in the final. This was the first of three combined Channel Slams with Federer accomplishing it in 2009 followed by Nadal's second in 2010. Federer has also prevented Nadal from winning the [[ATP Finals|Year-End Championships]] by defeating him in the 2010 finals and eliminating Nadal from the tournament in the 2006 and 2007 semifinals preventing Nadal from becoming only the second man after Andre Agassi to win a Career Grand Slam, a gold singles Olympic medal, and the Year End Championships, a distinction dubbed as a \"Career Super Slam\" by [[Sports Illustrated]]. At the 2017 Australian Open final, Federer denied Nadal's second opportunity (the 2014 Australian Open final was the first) to become the first man in the Open Era to have won each of the Grand Slam tournaments twice in men's singles.\n\nTheir record six consecutive calendar years atop the rankings from 2005\u201310 was due to their unprecedented combined performance in the Grand Slam and Masters Series  tournaments. During this span, they captured a combined record 21 of the 24 Grand Slam tournament titles (12 for Federer, 9 for Nadal), including a record 11 consecutive titles from 2005\u201307. They also dominated the [[ATP Tour Masters 1000|Masters Series]], combining for 31 of the 54 titles (18 for Nadal, 13 for Federer), including 8 of 9 in 2005 (4 each). Additionally, Federer won 4 of 6 [[ATP Finals|year-end tournaments]].\n\nFinally, both men not only possess [[Open Tennis|Open-Era]] records for [[ATP Tour records#Winning streaks|consecutive wins on a single surface]]\u2014Federer on both [[grass court|grass]] (65) and [[Hard (tennis)|hard courts]] (56), Nadal on [[clay court]]s (81)\u2014but each of these streaks was broken by the other player. Their respective dominance on grass and clay was the impetus for the \"[[Battle of Surfaces]]\", an exhibition match on a half-grass, half-clay court, which Nadal won with a 12\u201310 in the deciding tiebreak in May 2007 when both the grass and clay streaks were still active.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/sports/01iht-arena.1.5513670.html|title=Tennis: Nadal to meet Federer in an exhibition|author=Christopher Clarey|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 May 2007|access-date=14 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nOf their 40 matches, 20 have been on hard court, 16 have been on clay, and 4 have been on grass.

The heavy topspin created by Nadal's groundstrokes combined with his strategy of directing the majority of his serves and groundstrokes to Federer's single-handed backhand keeps Federer on the defensive and makes it harder for Federer to use his aggressive groundstrokes to dominate baseline rallies as he typically does against other opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Rethinking-Federer-Nadal--Roger%E2%80%99s-Backhand-Puts-Hi.aspx|title=Rethinking Federer-Nadal: Roger's Backhand Puts Him at a Major Disadvantage \u2013 Tennis Now|author=|date=|work=TennisNow.com|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref> Federer says he is a \"different player due to Nadal's presence\" citing Nadal's game as a major reason for improvements in areas of his own game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/Roger-Federer-Rivalry-with-Rafa-has-been-the-most-intense-of-my-life-He-made-me-change-my-game-articolo27279.html|title=Roger Federer: \u00b4Rivalry with Rafa has been the most intense of my life.

However, from 2008 to 2014 Australian Open, Nadal compiled a lopsided 15\u20134 record, leading on each surface, grass (1\u20130), hard (7\u20133) and clay (7\u20131). Since then, after they played only one match in the next three years, Federer has dominated the rivalry with a 6\u20131 record. Federer has stated that early defeats to Nadal on clay courts had a long lasting mental effect on him in his matches against Nadal on other surfaces, and that the lopsided loss at 2008 French open affected him in his first two sets at 2008 Wimbledon final.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/tennis/88817154/roger-federer-says-crushing-claycourt-losses-to-rafael-nadal-shaped-lopsided-rivalry</ref> After his win over Nadal at 2017 Shanghai masters final, Federer credited his 2017 success on Nadal to bigger racquet frame and avoiding claycourt meetings against him since 2013.<ref>[http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/15/roger-federer-reveals-exactly-how-hes-turned-rafael-nadal-rivalry-on-its-head-after-shanghai-win-7001380/ \"Roger Federer reveals exactly how he\u2019s turned Rafael Nadal rivalry on its head after Shanghai win\"].

Federer's Grand Slam tournament titles include 11 on hard courts, 8 on grass, and 1 on clay. Nadal is second on the all-time list for the most Grand Slam titles with 19 in total: 12 on clay, 5 on hard courts, and 2 on grass. Nadal and Mats Wilander are the only players in the open era to have won at least 2 Grand Slam titles on each of the 3 surfaces.\n\nNadal is the youngest male in the open era to win the Career Grand Slam.

Roger Federer has 28, with 22 coming on hardcourts and 6 on clay. Federer is missing two Masters 1000 titles, both of which are played on clay (Monte Carlo and Rome) while Nadal is missing two Masters 1000 titles (Miami and Paris), both of which are played on hard courts, having won the German Open Hamburg before it was downgraded to ATP 500 in 2009 and replaced by the Madrid Masters (clay). Nadal also won the Madrid Masters event in 2005 when it was played on indoor hardcourts in October, the same slot that Shanghai Masters has today.\n\nNadal prevented Federer from winning Monte Carlo three times from 2006 to 2008.

An important distinction is the relative success of the two players on indoor and outdoor hard courts. In the former, Federer leads Nadal with a 5\u20131 record, while on outdoor hard courts, Nadal leads 8\u20136. The quicker conditions and low bounce of the indoor hard courts fit Federer's style, while the slower and high bouncing conditions of most outdoor ones favor Nadal. Federer has defeated Nadal in four out of five encounters they have had at the Year End Championships, including the 2010 final, which are played on indoor hardcourts. This is the only surface on which they have exchanged the lead in their head-to-head, which has happened several times. In reference to their match at the [[2012 Australian Open]], Nadal has said that Federer is typically the \"favourite\" on \"these kinds of surfaces\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/bruce_jenkins/01/24/Nadal.Federer/index.html|title=Australian Open semifinal to speak volumes on Federer-Nadal rivalry|last=Jenkins|first=Bruce|date=24 January 2012|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|language=|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Clay ====\n\nNadal and Federer have played 16 of their 40 matches on [[clay court|clay]], with Nadal holding a 14\u20132 advantage over Federer. The matches comprise 13 tournament finals and 3 semifinals. The Spaniard has won all of their seven meetings in best of five set matches on clay and all six at Roland Garros. Their last match on clay was played at the 2019 French Open.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Nadal won every [[French Open]], defeating Federer in each of those tournaments (in the 2005 semifinal and the 2006, 2007, 2008 finals), as well as in the 2011 final. From 2005\u20132010, Nadal won at least 2 of the 3 clay [[ATP Tour Masters 1000|Masters]] events each year, defeating Federer in 6 of those. Statistically, Nadal has the highest win percentage on clay of any player in ATP history, and is second only to [[Anthony Wilding]] all-time. As a result, some analysts and players, such as [[Pat Cash]] and [[Conchita Mart\u00ednez]], consider Nadal the greatest clay-court player ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/columns/story?columnist=harwitt_sandra&id=3432383|title=Is Rafael Nadal the best clay-court player ever?|author=Sandra Harwitt|publisher=ESPN|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Federer Winning Moment Wimbledon 2007.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Federer's winning moment in the finals against Nadal at [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon 2007]].]] -->\n\n==== Grass ====\n\nFederer and Nadal have met four times on grass, specifically the Wimbledon finals from 2006 to 2008, and the semifinal of 2019. Federer has a 3-1 advantage over Nadal on this surface, winning the first two finals and the semifinal, while Nadal won the third final. Federer has won the Wimbledon Championships eight times, and Nadal has won the championships twice. Five of Federer's titles were consecutive titles (from 2003 to 2007), and the sixth, seventh and eighth titles were won in 2009, 2012 and 2017. The 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts.{{efn|name=Wimbledon2008}}\n\n=== Skill comparisons ===\n\nFederer has been more successful than Nadal on fast courts because he hits a flatter forehand and has a faster serve. Grass and indoor hard courts are faster surfaces, so Federer's flatter shots there result in a lower bouncing, faster moving trajectory.

evolution ==\n\nFederer and Nadal were born just under four years and 10 months apart. Federer's birthday is 8 August 1981, while Nadal's is 3 June 1986. A different viewpoint of their career evolution is offered by taking the season they ended with an age of 16 as starting point, and comparing their accomplishments at the same age. For instance in 2006, Federer finished the season being 25 years old having accumulated a career record of nine Major titles, and ranked No.1. By comparison, Nadal finished the 2011 season also aged 25, having accumulated ten Major titles in total, and being ranked No.2.\n\n* <nowiki>()</nowiki> = active record (updated 3 February 2020)\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Age at end of season!!16!!17!!18!!19!!20!!21!!22!!23!!24!!25!!26!!27!!28!!29!!30!!31!!32!!33!!34!!35!!36!!37!!38!!39\n|-\n!colspan=2|{{flagicon|SUI}} [[Roger Federer|Federer]]'s season!!1997!!1998!!1999!!2000!!2001!!2002!!2003!!2004!!2005!!2006!!2007!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018!!2019!!2020\n|-\n!colspan=2|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Rafael Nadal|Nadal]]'s season!!2002!!2003!!2004!!2005!!2006!!2007!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018!!2019!!2020!!!!!!!!!!\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Grand Slam titles''' || '''Federer''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 4 || 6 || 9 || 12 || 13 || 15 || 16 || 16 || 17 || 17 || 17 || 17 || 17 || 19 || 20 || 20 || (20)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 5 || 6 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 13 || 14 || 14 || 14 || 16 || 17 || 19 || (19) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Grand Slam match wins''' || '''Federer''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 7 || 20 || 26 || 39 || 61 || 85 || 112 || 138 || 162 || 188 || 208 || 228 || 247 || 260 || 279 || 297 || 307 || 325 || 339 || 357 || (362)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 0 || 0 || 6 || 19 || 36 || 56 || 80 || 95 || 120 || 143 || 157 || 171 || 187 || 198 || 203 || 226 || 247 || 271 || (275) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''ATP Finals titles''' || '''Federer''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 4 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || (6)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || (0) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Masters 1000 titles ''|| '''Federer '''|| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 4 || 8 || 12 || 14 || 14 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 21 || 21 || 23 || 24 || 24 || 27 || 27 || 28 || (28)\n|-\n| '''Nadal ''|| 0 || 0 || 0 || 4 || 6 || 9 || 12 || 15 || 18 || 19 || 21 || 26 || 27 || 27 || 28 || 30 || 33 || 35 || (35) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Total titles''' || '''Federer''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 4 || 11 || 22 || 33 || 45 || 53 || 57 || 61 || 66 || 70 || 76 || 77 || 82 || 88 || 88 || 95 || 99 || 103 || (103)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 0 || 0 || 1 || 12 || 17 || 23 || 31 || 36 || 43 || 46 || 50 || 60 || 64 || 67 || 69 || 75 || 80 || 84 || (85) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Total match wins''' || '''Federer''' || 0 || 2 || 15 || 51 || 100 || 158 || 236 || 310 || 391 || 483 || 551 || 617 || 678 || 743 || 807 || 878 || 923 || 996 || 1059 || 1080 || 1134 || 1184 || 1237 || (1242)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 1 || 14 || 45 || 124 || 183 || 253 || 335 || 401 || 472 || 541 || 583 || 658 || 706 || 767 || 806 || 873 || 919 || 977 || (990) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Ranking''' || '''Federer''' ||   || 301 || 64 || 29 || 13 || 6 || 2 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 2 || 6 || 2 || 3 || 16 || 2 || 3 || 3 || (3)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 200 || 49 || 51 || 2 || 2 || 2 || 1 || 2 || 1 || 2 || 4 || 1 || 3 || 5 || 9 || 1 || 2 || 1 || (2) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|'''Weeks at number 1''' || '''Federer''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 48 || 100 || 152 || 204 || 237 || 262 || 285 || 285 || 302 || 302 || 302 || 302 || 302 || 302 || 310 || 310 || (310)\n|-\n| '''Nadal''' || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 19 || 46 || 76 || 102 || 102 || 115 || 141 || 141 || 141 || 160 || 196 || 205 || (209) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|}\n\n=== Titles by tournaments played comparison ===\n\nAnother way to view their respective careers and evolution is to look at the progression of titles won by the number of tournaments played to win each of their titles at each level of competition including Grand Slam tournaments, ATP Tour Masters 1000 (formerly ATP Masters Series), ATP Finals (formerly Tennis Masters Cup), Olympic Games, ATP Tour 500 Series (formerly ATP International Series Gold), and ATP Tour 250 Series (formerly ATP International Series).

This was a charity tennis match for the [[Fundaci\u00f3n Rafa Nadal]] (Rafael Nadal Foundation).\n\nOn 1 January 2011 they played in the final of the knockout exhibition tournament; the [[2011 Mubadala World Tennis Championship \u2013 Singles|Mubadala World Tennis Championship]] on a hard court. Federer had beaten S\u00f6derling in the previous round and Nadal had beaten Berdych in the previous round.

Federer won 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20133.\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n=== Significant aspects ===\n\nThe rivalry between Federer and Nadal has been a huge part of both men's careers. Their [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament histories are of particular interest, especially their all-time record of nine finals encounters.<ref name=\"atp-therivalry\"/> This includes playing French Open and Wimbledon finals for three consecutive years (2006\u201308), culminating in what many consider the greatest match in tennis history at Wimbledon 2008.<ref name=\"greatestmatchever\"/><ref name=\"McEnroe-greatestmatch\"/><ref name=\"wertheim-greatestmatch\"/><ref name=\"tignor-greatestmatch\"/> Nadal, who had to defeat Federer during each of his first six Grand Slam title runs, possesses a 6\u20133 advantage in their Grand Slam finals encounters as well as a 4\u20131 edge in semifinals.\n\nNadal denied Federer a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|Career Grand Slam]] plus two potential [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Players who completed the Grand Slam|Grand Slam]]s (2006\u201307) by defeating him at the French Open every year from 2005\u201308. Federer would complete a Career Grand Slam by winning the French title in 2009 after Nadal was upset in the fourth round. Meanwhile, Federer twice denied Nadal from becoming the first man since [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]] in 1980 to win the \"Channel Slam\" (both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year) by defeating him in their first two Wimbledon finals, but Nadal succeeded the following year by defeating Federer in the final. This was the first of three combined Channel Slams with Federer accomplishing it in 2009 followed by Nadal's second in 2010. Federer has also prevented Nadal from winning the [[ATP Finals|Year-End Championships]] by defeating him in the 2010 finals and eliminating Nadal from the tournament in the 2006 and 2007 semifinals preventing Nadal from becoming only the second man after Andre Agassi to win a Career Grand Slam, a gold singles Olympic medal, and the Year End Championships, a distinction dubbed as a \"Career Super Slam\" by [[Sports Illustrated]]. At the 2017 Australian Open final, Federer denied Nadal's second opportunity (the 2014 Australian Open final was the first) to become the first man in the Open Era to have won each of the Grand Slam tournaments twice in men's singles.\n\nTheir record six consecutive calendar years atop the rankings from 2005\u201310 was due to their unprecedented combined performance in the Grand Slam and Masters Series  tournaments. During this span, they captured a combined record 21 of the 24 Grand Slam tournament titles (12 for Federer, 9 for Nadal), including a record 11 consecutive titles from 2005\u201307. They also dominated the [[ATP Tour Masters 1000|Masters Series]], combining for 31 of the 54 titles (18 for Nadal, 13 for Federer), including 8 of 9 in 2005 (4 each). Additionally, Federer won 4 of 6 [[ATP Finals|year-end tournaments]].\n\nFinally, both men not only possess [[Open Tennis|Open-Era]] records for [[ATP Tour records#Winning streaks|consecutive wins on a single surface]]\u2014Federer on both [[grass court|grass]] (65) and [[Hard (tennis)|hard courts]] (56), Nadal on [[clay court]]s (81)\u2014but each of these streaks was broken by the other player. Their respective dominance on grass and clay was the impetus for the \"[[Battle of Surfaces]]\", an exhibition match on a half-grass, half-clay court, which Nadal won with a 12\u201310 in the deciding tiebreak in May 2007 when both the grass and clay streaks were still active.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/sports/01iht-arena.1.5513670.html|title=Tennis: Nadal to meet Federer in an exhibition|author=Christopher Clarey|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 May 2007|access-date=14 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nOf their 40 matches, 20 have been on hard court, 16 have been on clay, and 4 have been on grass.

The heavy topspin created by Nadal's groundstrokes combined with his strategy of directing the majority of his serves and groundstrokes to Federer's single-handed backhand keeps Federer on the defensive and makes it harder for Federer to use his aggressive groundstrokes to dominate baseline rallies as he typically does against other opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Rethinking-Federer-Nadal--Roger%E2%80%99s-Backhand-Puts-Hi.aspx|title=Rethinking Federer-Nadal: Roger's Backhand Puts Him at a Major Disadvantage \u2013 Tennis Now|author=|date=|work=TennisNow.com|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref> Federer says he is a \"different player due to Nadal's presence\" citing Nadal's game as a major reason for improvements in areas of his own game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/Roger-Federer-Rivalry-with-Rafa-has-been-the-most-intense-of-my-life-He-made-me-change-my-game-articolo27279.html|title=Roger Federer: \u00b4Rivalry with Rafa has been the most intense of my life.

However, from 2008 to 2014 Australian Open, Nadal compiled a lopsided 15\u20134 record, leading on each surface, grass (1\u20130), hard (7\u20133) and clay (7\u20131). Since then, after they played only one match in the next three years, Federer has dominated the rivalry with a 6\u20131 record. Federer has stated that early defeats to Nadal on clay courts had a long lasting mental effect on him in his matches against Nadal on other surfaces, and that the lopsided loss at 2008 French open affected him in his first two sets at 2008 Wimbledon final.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/tennis/88817154/roger-federer-says-crushing-claycourt-losses-to-rafael-nadal-shaped-lopsided-rivalry</ref> After his win over Nadal at 2017 Shanghai masters final, Federer credited his 2017 success on Nadal to bigger racquet frame and avoiding claycourt meetings against him since 2013.<ref>[http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/15/roger-federer-reveals-exactly-how-hes-turned-rafael-nadal-rivalry-on-its-head-after-shanghai-win-7001380/ \"Roger Federer reveals exactly how he\u2019s turned Rafael Nadal rivalry on its head after Shanghai win\"].

Federer's Grand Slam tournament titles include 11 on hard courts, 8 on grass, and 1 on clay. Nadal is second on the all-time list for the most Grand Slam titles with 19 in total: 12 on clay, 5 on hard courts, and 2 on grass. Nadal and Mats Wilander are the only players in the open era to have won at least 2 Grand Slam titles on each of the 3 surfaces.\n\nNadal is the youngest male in the open era to win the Career Grand Slam.

Federer is missing two Masters 1000 titles, both of which are played on clay (Monte Carlo and Rome) while Nadal is missing two Masters 1000 titles (Miami and Paris), both of which are played on hard courts, having won the German Open Hamburg before it was downgraded to ATP 500 in 2009 and replaced by the Madrid Masters (clay). Nadal also won the Madrid Masters event in 2005 when it was played on indoor hardcourts in October, the same slot that Shanghai Masters has today.\n\nNadal prevented Federer from winning Monte Carlo three times from 2006 to 2008.

An important distinction is the relative success of the two players on indoor and outdoor hard courts. In the former, Federer leads Nadal with a 5\u20131 record, while on outdoor hard courts, Nadal leads 8\u20136. The quicker conditions and low bounce of the indoor hard courts fit Federer's style, while the slower and high bouncing conditions of most outdoor ones favor Nadal. Federer has defeated Nadal in four out of five encounters they have had at the Year End Championships, including the 2010 final, which are played on indoor hardcourts. This is the only surface on which they have exchanged the lead in their head-to-head, which has happened several times. In reference to their match at the [[2012 Australian Open]], Nadal has said that Federer is typically the \"favourite\" on \"these kinds of surfaces\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/bruce_jenkins/01/24/Nadal.Federer/index.html|title=Australian Open semifinal to speak volumes on Federer-Nadal rivalry|last=Jenkins|first=Bruce|date=24 January 2012|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|language=|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Clay ====\n\nNadal and Federer have played 16 of their 40 matches on [[clay court|clay]], with Nadal holding a 14\u20132 advantage over Federer. The matches comprise 13 tournament finals and 3 semifinals. The Spaniard has won all of their seven meetings in best of five set matches on clay and all six at Roland Garros. Their last match on clay was played at the 2019 French Open.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Nadal won every [[French Open]], defeating Federer in each of those tournaments (in the 2005 semifinal and the 2006, 2007, 2008 finals), as well as in the 2011 final. From 2005\u20132010, Nadal won at least 2 of the 3 clay [[ATP Tour Masters 1000|Masters]] events each year, defeating Federer in 6 of those. Statistically, Nadal has the highest win percentage on clay of any player in ATP history, and is second only to [[Anthony Wilding]] all-time. As a result, some analysts and players, such as [[Pat Cash]] and [[Conchita Mart\u00ednez]], consider Nadal the greatest clay-court player ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/columns/story?columnist=harwitt_sandra&id=3432383|title=Is Rafael Nadal the best clay-court player ever?|author=Sandra Harwitt|publisher=ESPN|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Federer Winning Moment Wimbledon 2007.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Federer's winning moment in the finals against Nadal at [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon 2007]].]] -->\n\n==== Grass ====\n\nFederer and Nadal have met four times on grass, specifically the Wimbledon finals from 2006 to 2008, and the semifinal of 2019. Federer has a 3-1 advantage over Nadal on this surface, winning the first two finals and the semifinal, while Nadal won the third final. Federer has won the Wimbledon Championships eight times, and Nadal has won the championships twice. Five of Federer's titles were consecutive titles (from 2003 to 2007), and the sixth, seventh and eighth titles were won in 2009, 2012 and 2017. The 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts.{{efn|name=Wimbledon2008}}\n\n=== Skill comparisons ===\n\nFederer has been more successful than Nadal on fast courts because he hits a flatter forehand and has a faster serve. Grass and indoor hard courts are faster surfaces, so Federer's flatter shots there result in a lower bouncing, faster moving trajectory. Thus, Nadal's [[topspin]] is less effective on such faster courts, but is most effective on slower courts such as clay. Nadal has improved his serving speed and placement over the years, but Federer still serves faster on average and earns more aces and service winners, while Nadal has an overall stronger ground stroke game.<ref name=\"garber-nadalimprove\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=3472238|title=Nadal has improved virtually every aspect of his game|last=Garber|first=Greg|date=3 July 2008|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Matchfacts/Matchfacts-List.aspx?c=3&s=0&y=0 |title=Ricoh ATP Matchfacts \u2013 Career 2nd Serve Points Won |publisher=ATP World Tour |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Matchfacts/Matchfacts-List.aspx?c=7&s=0&y=0 |title=Ricoh ATP Matchfacts \u2013 Career 2nd Serve Return Points Won |publisher=ATP World Tour |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile Nadal is statistically weaker than Federer on both hard and grass courts, he has nonetheless achieved considerable success on both surfaces, including notable wins at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wimbledon (2008 and 2010), the Australian Open (2009), the US Open (2010, 2013, 2017 and 2019), and at various hard court Masters series tournaments. Nadal is one of only 2 men to have won at least 2 Grand Slam titles on each surface.\n\nSimilarly, Federer too has achieved considerable success on clay, winning the French Open (2009) and reaching the finals on four other occasions (2006, 2007, 2008 and 2011) and winning the Madrid/Hamburg Masters six times (2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2012).\n\n=== Media and player commentary ===\n\nDuring interviews, many fellow and former players have regarded both Federer and Nadal as among the best tennis players of all time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/sports/tennis/30nadal.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss \"Finding Spot in History Without Looking\"] ''New York Times'', 29 August 2010</ref><ref name=\"Richard Jago\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/05/pete-sampras-roger-federer-wimbledon|title='Roger Federer is the greatest' says Pete Sampras after record broken|author=Richard Jago|work=the Guardian|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Richard Jago\"/> In November 2010, former player [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]] stated that he believed Federer to be the greatest player of all time, but \"Rafa has the chance to be the greatest player\" if he stays healthy.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/tennis/story/john-mcenroe-says-nadal-can-surpass-federer-111610|title=McEnroe says Nadal can surpass Federer |publisher=Fox Sports |agency=Associated Press|date=16 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nFormer player and commentator John McEnroe was of a similar opinion, noting in 2010 that \"there is an argument to be made that Rafael Nadal may be the greatest player eventually, even possibly now.\"<ref name=\"Associated Press\"/> He has subsequently  adjusted his opinion on several occasions, in 2013 noting that he thought Nadal was \"the greatest player that ever lived\" <ref>{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/tennis-busted-racquet/john-mcenroe-rafael-nadal-best-ever-even-first-164644632.html |title=John McEnroe: Rafael Nadal is the Best Ever |work=yahoo|date=25 Jun 2013|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> but later in 2014 bunched Federer, Nadal, Laver and Sampras together as the greatest ever.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stevegtennis.com/2014/12/john-mcenroe-novak-djokovic-could-win-french-open-in-2015/ | title=Novak Djokovic Could Win French Open | accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref>  In July 2015, he reversed his opinion and again backed Roger Federer for the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/07/roger-federer-greatest-player-wimbledon-ever-john-mcenroe-rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic|title=John McEnroe says Roger Federer, not Rafa Nadal, is now the best player ever|work=For The Win|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref> In January 2017, after Federer, then 35 years of age and returning to competitive play after a 6-month layoff due to injury, triumphed over Nadal in 5 sets to win the record-breaking 18th major at the 2017 Australian Open, McEnroe  remarked that Federer had cemented his status as being the best tennis player of all time, but also left open the possibility that Nadal can be in the running again should he win additional men's singles majors to narrow the gap.\n\nIn October 2013, Rod Laver, the only tennis player to achieve the Grand Slam twice, said \"When I look at Federer, with what he's accomplished, against the competition that he's accomplished it with, I'd have to say I would think that Roger is the greatest player,\"\n\nAt the press conference following his 9th record French Open win in 2014 and a total of 14 Slams, three shy of Federer's 17, Nadal said that he really does not care much about records, \"I'll follow my own path.

The book consequently inspired a 2018 film of the same name directed by Andrew Douglas, which updated the story to include their comebacks and recent domination of the slams. The documentary also includes footage of a skinny 12 year old Nadal before the development of his famously muscular physique and a number of clips of a surprisingly bad tempered Federer who admits in the film that he had to change his behaviour in order to progress his career.\n\nThe documentary features contributions from former players such as John McEnroe, Bj\u00f6rn Borg, Pete Sampras, Tim Henman and Carlos Moya - Nadal's current coach - and family members including Federer's mother and father. An illuminating film, it was well received by audiences, scoring 9.2 on [[IMDb|IMDB]]'s user rating database.\n\n== Pairing Federer and Nadal ==\n\n=== Significant achievements ===\n\n* From the 2003 Wimbledon Championships to the 2011 French Open, Federer and Nadal won an unprecedented 26 out of 32 Major titles.

This broke the previous record of seven finals set by Bill Tilden and William Johnston (1919\u201325 U.S. Championships). Their match at the 2012 Australian Open also marked a 10th time two players had faced each other in Grand Slam men's singles matches, tying the record set by [[John McEnroe]] and [[Ivan Lendl]].<ref name=\"Stats\">{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Hawkins | title = Federer-Nadal continue historic rivalry | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url = http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/37472/federer-nadal-continue-historic-rivalry | date = 25 January 2012 | accessdate = 25 January 2012 | language = }}</ref> This record has now been surpassed by Federer-Djokovic when they met for the 13th time in a Major at the 2012 Wimbledon semifinals.\n* Federer and Nadal are the only No. 1 and No. 2 pair to win 11 consecutive Grand Slam singles tournaments between them (from the 2005 French Open to the 2007 US Open).

evolution ==\n\nFederer and Nadal were born just under four years and 10 months apart. Federer's birthday is 8 August 1981, while Nadal's is 3 June 1986. A different viewpoint of their career evolution is offered by taking the season they ended with an age of 16 as starting point, and comparing their accomplishments at the same age. For instance in 2006, Federer finished the season being 25 years old having accumulated a career record of nine Major titles, and ranked No.1.

The play is set during the rent strike in Glasgow, 1915. Although Barbour does not feature as a character, the play reproduces a famous Barbour incident from the rent-strike.\nThe most important thing in the Quinn household is the piano.<ref name=EGQ /> In Part One Scene Two, the piano is sequestrated by sheriff officers in lieu of owed rent. The Quinns, at this point, are not rent-strikers but are instead simply unable to pay their rent because of their poverty. In Part One, Scene Four William Quinn (Elizabeth's husband) narrates how he, aided by fifty women rent-strikers, and with the assistance of shipyard workers simply walked into the factor's office and asked for it to be returned.\n{{Quote|text=The factor was afraid of us |author=William Quinn |source=Part 1 Scene 4}}.\nHelen Crawfurd in her unpublished memoir recounts how during the rent-strike factors would try to collect the rental increases by resorting to the blackmail of social humiliation.

The play is set during the rent strike in Glasgow, 1915. Although Barbour does not feature as a character, the play reproduces a famous Barbour incident from the rent-strike.\nThe most important thing in the Quinn household is the piano.<ref name=EGQ /> In Part One Scene Two, the piano is sequestrated by sheriff officers in lieu of owed rent. The Quinns, at this point, are not rent-strikers but are instead simply unable to pay their rent because of their poverty. In Part One, Scene Four William Quinn (Elizabeth's husband) narrates how he, aided by fifty women rent-strikers, and with the assistance of shipyard workers simply walked into the factor's office and asked for it to be returned.\n{{Quote|text=The factor was afraid of us |author=William Quinn |source=Part 1 Scene 4}}.\nHelen Crawfurd in her unpublished memoir recounts how during the rent-strike factors would try to collect the rental increases by resorting to the blackmail of social humiliation. The ploy was to dupe individual household tenants into believing that everyone else in the close had paid up. Upon one of these occasions Barbour drafted in men from Govan's shipyards, led them to the factor's office and demanded the amount of the increase be returned. 'Faced with thousands of black-faced workers the factor handed over the money' Crawfurd recalls.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Craig|first1=Maggie|title=When The Clyde Ran Red|date=2011|publisher=Mainstream|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84596-735-2|pages=111\u2013112|chapter=Mrs Barbour's Army: The Rent Strike of 1915}}</ref><br />\nThe song ''Mrs Barbour's Army'' by [[Alistair Hulett]] is about Mary Barbour's organisation of the 1915 rent strike.<ref>Nick Martin, [http://unionsong.com/reviews/hulett/ \"Interview with Alistair Hulett 1 April 2002\"]</ref> Mary Barbour was the subject of one of the ''Not Forgotten'' series of documentaries on [[Channel Four]] in 2007.<ref>[http://www.gcu.ac.uk/media/gcalwebv2/library/content/Clydewomen.pdf Women on Red Clydeside]</ref> In 2012 the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme [[Woman's Hour]] ran a profile about Mary Barbour following the writing of a poem about her by Christine Finn for an exhibition at the [[National Museum of Scotland]].<ref name=\"WH\">{{cite episode\n| title = Mary Barbour and the Glasgow Rent Strikes\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00m66qp\n| series = [[Woman's Hour]]\n| network = [[BBC]]\n| station = [[BBC Radio Four]]\n| airdate = 29 November 2011\n| time = 10:00 }}</ref> The poem was called ''Mary Barbour's Rattle'' and can be viewed on the Museum's website.<ref name=\"NMS\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/26_treasures/the_treasures/govan_rent_strike_rattle.aspx | title=Govan rent strike rattle | publisher=[[National Museum of Scotland]] | accessdate=14 February 2014 | author=Finn, Christine | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209135024/http://nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/26_treasures/the_treasures/govan_rent_strike_rattle.aspx | archivedate=9 February 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n''Mrs Barbour's Daughters'' is a play by A.J.
