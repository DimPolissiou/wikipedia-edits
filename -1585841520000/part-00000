It gained great popularity elsewhere in the [[United States]] during the early 20th century and from there spread internationally.\n\nThe [[Tone (musical instrument)|tone]] and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.\n\n==History==\n\nThe {{okina}}ukulele is commonly associated with [[music from Hawaii]] where the name roughly translates as \"jumping flea\",<ref>{{harvnb|Beloff|2003|p=13}}</ref> perhaps because of the movement of the player's fingers.

One of the earliest appearances of the word ''{{okina}}ukulele'' in print (in the sense of a stringed instrument) is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s ''Catalogue of the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments of All Nations'' published in 1907.

During [[World War II]], authorities banned most Western music, but fans and players kept it alive in secret, and it resumed popularity after the war.

[[Jim Beloff]] set out to promote the instrument in the early 1990s and created over two dozen {{okina}}ukulele music books featuring modern music as well as classic ukulele pieces.<ref>''[[Mighty Uke]]'', Interview with Jim Beloff, 2010</ref>\n\nAll-time best selling Hawaiian musician [[Israel Kamakawiwo'ole]] helped re-popularise the instrument, in particular with his 1993 [[reggae]]-rhythmed [[Medley (music)|medley]] of \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" and \"[[What a Wonderful World]],\" used in films, television programs, and commercials. The song reached no. 12 on ''Billboard'''s [[Hot Digital Tracks]] chart the week of January 31, 2004.<ref>''Billboard'', for the survey week ending January 18, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe creation of YouTube was a large influence on the popularity of the {{okina}}ukulele. One of the first videos to go viral was [[Jake Shimabukuro]]'s {{okina}}ukulele rendition of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" on [[YouTube]]. The video quickly went [[Viral video|viral]], and as of April 2019, had received over 16 million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSkP3uym5k|title=Ukulele weeps by Jake Shimabukuro|last=cromulantman|date=22 April 2006|accessdate=3 April 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe {{okina}}ukulele is generally made of wood, though variants have been composed partially or entirely of plastic or other materials. Cheaper {{okina}}ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive {{okina}}ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawai{{okina}}i, called [[koa]].\n\nTypically, {{okina}}ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a \"pineapple\" {{okina}}ukulele, invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern {{okina}}ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F. Martin & Co.|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and Nylgut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquilausa.com/uke_strings.html|title=Aquila Nylgut Ukulele Strings, wholesale source for retailers and dealers|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nInstruments with 6 or 8 strings in four courses are often called taropatches, or taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> A Javanese {{okina}}ukulele commonly has only three strings. Apparently, it's a modern innovation, as the first generation of  three-stringed {{okina}}ukuleles were four stringed instruments with one string removed. They are now manufactured with only three strings.\n[[File:3 ukes.jpg|thumb|140px|Soprano pineapple ukulele, baritone ukulele and taropatch baritone ukulele.]]\n\n==Types and sizes==\nCommon types of {{okina}}ukuleles include soprano (standard {{okina}}ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone.  Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and [[Contrabass|contrabass]] {{okina}}ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Size and popular tunings of standard {{okina}}ukulele types:'''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px\"   | Type\n! style=\"width:96px\"   | Alternate<br/>names\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | Typical<br/>length\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | [[Scale (string instruments)|Scale<br/> length]]<ref>The \u201cscale\u201d is the length of the playable part of the strings, from the nut at the top to the bridge at the bottom.</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"  | Frets\n! style=\"width:60px;\"  | Range<ref>Exact range depends on the tuning and the number of frets.</ref>\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Common<br />tuning<ref>On the soprano, concert, and tenor instruments, the most common tuning results in a \"bottom\" string that is ''not'' the lowest in ''pitch'', as it is tuned a 5th&nbsp;higher than the next string (and a major&nbsp;2nd below the \"top\" string).

This is known as a \"[[reentrant tuning]]\"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. \n\nMore rarely used with the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or \"low G\" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. \n\nAnother common tuning for the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the \"standard\" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.  There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.<ref>Tranquada, J.; ''The Ukulele:  A History''; University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu:  2012.  0824-83634-0  According to Tranquanda, \"\"This is an old and seemingly never-ending argument. While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning.\"</ref>\n\nFor the concert and tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor {{okina}}ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.\n\nThe baritone {{okina}}ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. \n\nBass {{okina}}ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.\n\nSopranino {{okina}}ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAs is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone {{okina}}ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup>. Some players tune {{okina}}ukuleles like other four-string instruments such as the [[mandolin]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://ourpastimes.com/how-to-play-a-ukulele-like-a-mandolin-12450760.html\n| title=How to Play a Ukulele Like a Mandolin\n| first=Robert\n| last=Russell\n| date=15 September 2017\n| publisher=Our Pastimes\n| accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> Venezuelan [[cuatro (Venezuela)|cuatro]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHF_g96Es3Q\n| title=Cuatro Tuning On a Ukulele\n| first=Ken\n| last=Middleton\n| date=2 May 2018\n| accessdate=19 November 2019\n| via=YouTube}}</ref> or [[dotara]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyr1iT27MzE\n| title=Ukulele Dotara Style Tuning - \u0987\u0989\u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09c7\u09b2\u09bf \u09a6\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u0987\u09b2 \u099f\u09bf\u0989\u09a8\u09bf\u0982\n| first=Rahatul Islam\n| last=Ovi\n| date=24 April 2017\n| publisher=Rahatul & Dukulele\n| accessdate=24 April 2017\n| via=YouTube}}</ref> Ukuleles may also be tuned to [[open tuning]]s, similar to the Hawaiian [[slack key]] style.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Kimura\n| first = Heeday\n| title = How to Play Slack Key Ukulule\n| date =\n| pages =\n| isbn = }}</ref>\n\n==Related instruments==\n{{okina}}Ukulele varieties include hybrid instruments such as the [[guitalele]] (also called guitarlele), [[banjo ukulele|banjo {{okina}}ukulele]] (also called banjolele), [[harp ukulele|harp {{okina}}ukulele]], [[lap steel ukulele|lap steel {{okina}}ukulele]], and the [[ukelin]].

One of the earliest appearances of the word ''{{okina}}ukulele'' in print (in the sense of a stringed instrument) is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s ''Catalogue of the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments of All Nations'' published in 1907.

Cheaper {{okina}}ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive {{okina}}ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawai{{okina}}i, called [[koa]].\n\nTypically, {{okina}}ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a \"pineapple\" {{okina}}ukulele, invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern {{okina}}ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F. Martin & Co.|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and Nylgut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquilausa.com/uke_strings.html|title=Aquila Nylgut Ukulele Strings, wholesale source for retailers and dealers|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nInstruments with 6 or 8 strings in four courses are often called taropatches, or taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> A Javanese {{okina}}ukulele commonly has only three strings. Apparently, it's a modern innovation, as the first generation of  three-stringed {{okina}}ukuleles were four stringed instruments with one string removed. They are now manufactured with only three strings.\n[[File:3 ukes.jpg|thumb|140px|Soprano pineapple ukulele, baritone ukulele and taropatch baritone ukulele.]]\n\n==Types and sizes==\nCommon types of {{okina}}ukuleles include soprano (standard {{okina}}ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone.  Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and [[Contrabass|contrabass]] {{okina}}ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Size and popular tunings of standard {{okina}}ukulele types:'''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px\"   | Type\n! style=\"width:96px\"   | Alternate<br/>names\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | Typical<br/>length\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | [[Scale (string instruments)|Scale<br/> length]]<ref>The \u201cscale\u201d is the length of the playable part of the strings, from the nut at the top to the bridge at the bottom.</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"  | Frets\n! style=\"width:60px;\"  | Range<ref>Exact range depends on the tuning and the number of frets.</ref>\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Common<br />tuning<ref>On the soprano, concert, and tenor instruments, the most common tuning results in a \"bottom\" string that is ''not'' the lowest in ''pitch'', as it is tuned a 5th&nbsp;higher than the next string (and a major&nbsp;2nd below the \"top\" string).

The examples shown in the chart reflect the range of each instrument from the lowest standard tuning, to the highest fret in the highest standard tuning.\n\n==Tuning==<!--[[My dog has fleas]] links directly here-->\n[[File:Ukulele standard tuning.png|thumb|Ukulele C<sup>6</sup> tuning {{audio|Ukulele standard tuning.mid|Play}}.]]\n[[File:My dog has fleas.png|thumb|\"My dog has fleas\" tuning. {{audio|My dog has fleas.mid|Play}}]]\n\nOne of the most common tunings for the standard or soprano {{okina}}ukulele is [[Sixth chord|C<sup>6</sup>]] tuning: G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is often remembered by the notes in the \"My dog has fleas\" jingle (see sidebar).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ukuleleintheclassroom.com/tunings.htm|title=Ukulele in the Classroom|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>  The G string is tuned an octave higher than might be expected, so this is often called \"high G\" tuning. This is known as a \"[[reentrant tuning]]\"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. \n\nMore rarely used with the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or \"low G\" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. \n\nAnother common tuning for the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the \"standard\" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.  There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.<ref>Tranquada, J.; ''The Ukulele:  A History''; University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu:  2012.  0824-83634-0  According to Tranquanda, \"\"This is an old and seemingly never-ending argument. While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning.\"</ref>\n\nFor the concert and tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor {{okina}}ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.\n\nThe baritone {{okina}}ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. \n\nBass {{okina}}ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.\n\nSopranino {{okina}}ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAs is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone {{okina}}ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup>. Some players tune {{okina}}ukuleles like other four-string instruments such as the [[mandolin]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://ourpastimes.com/how-to-play-a-ukulele-like-a-mandolin-12450760.html\n| title=How to Play a Ukulele Like a Mandolin\n| first=Robert\n| last=Russell\n| date=15 September 2017\n| publisher=Our Pastimes\n| accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> Venezuelan [[cuatro (Venezuela)|cuatro]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHF_g96Es3Q\n| title=Cuatro Tuning On a Ukulele\n| first=Ken\n| last=Middleton\n| date=2 May 2018\n| accessdate=19 November 2019\n| via=YouTube}}</ref> or [[dotara]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyr1iT27MzE\n| title=Ukulele Dotara Style Tuning - \u0987\u0989\u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09c7\u09b2\u09bf \u09a6\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u0987\u09b2 \u099f\u09bf\u0989\u09a8\u09bf\u0982\n| first=Rahatul Islam\n| last=Ovi\n| date=24 April 2017\n| publisher=Rahatul & Dukulele\n| accessdate=24 April 2017\n| via=YouTube}}</ref> Ukuleles may also be tuned to [[open tuning]]s, similar to the Hawaiian [[slack key]] style.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Kimura\n| first = Heeday\n| title = How to Play Slack Key Ukulule\n| date =\n| pages =\n| isbn = }}</ref>\n\n==Related instruments==\n{{okina}}Ukulele varieties include hybrid instruments such as the [[guitalele]] (also called guitarlele), [[banjo ukulele|banjo {{okina}}ukulele]] (also called banjolele), [[harp ukulele|harp {{okina}}ukulele]], [[lap steel ukulele|lap steel {{okina}}ukulele]], and the [[ukelin]].
