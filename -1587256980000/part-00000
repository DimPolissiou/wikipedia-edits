He is best known for his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), where he played as both a [[shooting guard]] and [[small forward]]. McGrady is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star]], seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection, two-time [[NBA annual scoring champion|NBA scoring champion]], and one-time winner of the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]]. He was also inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2017.\n\nMcGrady [[NBA high school draftees|entered the NBA straight out of high school]] and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin [[Vince Carter]]. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the [[Orlando Magic]], where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 2004, he was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he paired with center [[Yao Ming]] to help the Rockets become a perennial [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the [[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nSince retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for [[ESPN]]. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional [[baseball]], [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitching]] for the [[Sugar Land Skeeters]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in [[Bartow, Florida]], to Melanise Williford.<ref name=Reference /> His father was not a part of his everyday life, so Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|title=Tracy McGrady Biography|url=https://www.jockbio.com/Bios/McGrady/McGrady_bio.html|publisher=JockBio|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref> As a youth, McGrady played [[high school basketball]] and [[baseball]] at [[Auburndale High School]] for three years before transferring to [[Mt.

American former professional [[basketball]] player. He is best known for his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), where he played as both a [[shooting guard]] and [[small forward]]. McGrady is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star]], seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection, two-time [[NBA annual scoring champion|NBA scoring champion]], and one-time winner of the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]]. He was also inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2017.\n\nMcGrady [[NBA high school draftees|entered the NBA straight out of high school]] and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin [[Vince Carter]]. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the [[Orlando Magic]], where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 2004, he was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he paired with center [[Yao Ming]] to help the Rockets become a perennial [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the [[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nSince retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for [[ESPN]]. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional [[baseball]], [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitching]] for the [[Sugar Land Skeeters]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in [[Bartow, Florida]], to Melanise Williford.<ref name=Reference /> His father was not a part of his everyday life, so Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|title=Tracy McGrady Biography|url=https://www.jockbio.com/Bios/McGrady/McGrady_bio.html|publisher=JockBio|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref> As a youth, McGrady played [[high school basketball]] and [[baseball]] at [[Auburndale High School]] for three years before transferring to [[Mt.

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===19===\n\n===18===\n*[[Erik Belfrage]], 74, Swedish diplomat and businessman, COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/opbOgB/erik-belfrage-dod-i-coronaviruset Erik Belfrage d\u00f6d i coronaviruset] {{in lang|sv}}</ref> \n*[[Amparo D\u00e1vila]], 92, Mexican writer.<ref>[https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/mexican-author-amparo-davila-passes-away Mexican author Amparo Davila passes away]</ref>\n*{{ill|Rezo Esadze|ru|\u042d\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0435, \u0420\u0435\u0437\u043e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, 86, Georgian film director (''[[Love at First Sight (1977 Georgian film)|Love at First Sight]]''), actor (''[[Nine Days in One Year]]'', ''[[Wolfhound (2006 film)|Wolfhound]]'') and screenwriter.<ref>[https://www.newsgeorgia.ge/umer-izvestnyj-gruzinskij-kinorezhisser-rezo-jesadze/ \u0423\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0440 \u0420\u0435\u0437\u043e \u042d\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0435] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Lennart Jirlow|sv}}, 83, Swedish painter and scenographer.<ref>[https://www.svd.se/konstnaren-lennart-jirlow-ar-dod Konstn\u00e4ren Lennart Jirlow \u00e4r d\u00f6d] {{in lang|sv}}</ref>\n*[[Bob Lazier]], 81, American racing driver ([[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]]), COVID-19.<ref>[https://racer.com/2020/04/18/former-indy-500-rookie-of-the-year-bob-lazier-dies-at-81/ Former Indy 500 Rookie of the Year Bob Lazier dies at 81]</ref>\n*[[Iris Love]], 87, American archaeologist and dog breeder.<ref>[https://www.showbiz411.com/2020/04/18/remembering-iris-love-the-unique-combination-of-sass-and-scholar-was-87-a-socialite-who-was-a-real-archeologist Remembering Iris Love: The Unique Combination of Sass and Scholar was 87, A Socialite Who Was a Real Archeologist]</ref> (death announced on this date)\n*[[Paul H.

The grass plot in front of the house surrounded with ever-greens and shrubs, with a ''Gothic'' bench on one side, is very pretty, and the clumps to the water's edge well disposed : From thence, passing by a bridge, you follow the water through a pasture ground, with walks and benches around it; the banks closely shaven, the bends of them natural, and quite in the stile of a real river. About the middle of the field it divides and forms a small island, which contains two or three clumps of shrubs, and is a very great ornament to the place; the walk after-wards leads to the other winding ones around the field, which is certainly laid out in general in a good taste. There are, however, one or two circumstances, that cannot fail of striking every spectator, which, if they were a little altered, would be a great improvement. Directly across the whole runs a common foot-way, which, though walled in, cuts the grounds too much; a broad arch or two thrown over it, well covered with earth and planted with shrubs, would take off the ill effect of crossing this path. In the water is the imitation of a rock, every kind of which is totally unconsonant with the pleasing and agreeable emotions of the gently-winding stream, and smoothly-shaven banks; besides, any rock worth seeing would swallow up this water. In the next place here are some urns, an ornament, when properly disposed, of great efficacy; but close, shaded and sequestered spots, whereon the eye falls by accident, as it were, are the places for urns, and not open lawns, full in view, and to be walked around. It is surprising, that the ideas of imitating nature, in rejecting a strait line for the water, and giving its banks the wave of a real stream, should not be extended to hiding the conclusion, by winding it among the wood where it could not be followed; and it would have been a great improvement, to have given the stream in one place a much greater wave, so as to have enlarged it to four times its present width; this would have added much to the variety of the scene. Lastly, I might remark, that the circular bason near the end of the river has a very bad effect; any water so very artificial, should not be seen with the same eye that views the imitation of a real stream.}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|{{coord|53.7804635|-0.41392538|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Kingtree House (site of)}}, Kingtree House, demolished 1960s.<ref name=\"kht\"/>|group=\"map\"}}\n\n{{quote|\"At this place Mr. Watson has a pleasure-ground, which is very well worth seeing; it consists of shrubberies with winding walks, and the imitation of a meandering river through the whole...\"|[[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]| A six months tour through the north of England.<ref name=\"watsonshrub\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Snuff Mill House - geograph.org.uk - 384243.jpg|Snuff Mill House, built 1750 (2007)|thumb|upright]]\n[[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] was manufactured in the south of the village in the 18th&nbsp;century; towards the end of the century a large mill owned by [[Quaker]] William Travis was producing 15&nbsp;hundredweight of snuff per week.<ref name=\"c1797\"/><ref>{{cite book| url =https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea|title= General and concise history and description of the town and port of Kingston-upon-Hull |first = James Joseph |last = Sheahan| publisher = Simpkin, Marshall & Co.| year = 1864| page = [https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea/page/303 303]}}</ref> William Travis had a three storied house built in 1750 next to the mill.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1103397|desc=Snuff Mill House and railings|accessdate=4 December 2012| fewer-links=y}}</ref><ref group=\"map\">{{coord|53.7768|-0.4084|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Snuff Mill House}}, Snuff Mill House</ref>\n\nThe road from Cottingham to Hull connected with the Hull to Beverley Road (turnpiked by Act of 1744) at [[Newland, Kingston upon Hull|Newland]] toll bar; it was turnpiked as an extension of the Hull to Beverley Road in 1764.

The grass plot in front of the house surrounded with ever-greens and shrubs, with a ''Gothic'' bench on one side, is very pretty, and the clumps to the water's edge well disposed : From thence, passing by a bridge, you follow the water through a pasture ground, with walks and benches around it; the banks closely shaven, the bends of them natural, and quite in the stile of a real river. About the middle of the field it divides and forms a small island, which contains two or three clumps of shrubs, and is a very great ornament to the place; the walk after-wards leads to the other winding ones around the field, which is certainly laid out in general in a good taste. There are, however, one or two circumstances, that cannot fail of striking every spectator, which, if they were a little altered, would be a great improvement. Directly across the whole runs a common foot-way, which, though walled in, cuts the grounds too much; a broad arch or two thrown over it, well covered with earth and planted with shrubs, would take off the ill effect of crossing this path. In the water is the imitation of a rock, every kind of which is totally unconsonant with the pleasing and agreeable emotions of the gently-winding stream, and smoothly-shaven banks; besides, any rock worth seeing would swallow up this water. In the next place here are some urns, an ornament, when properly disposed, of great efficacy; but close, shaded and sequestered spots, whereon the eye falls by accident, as it were, are the places for urns, and not open lawns, full in view, and to be walked around. It is surprising, that the ideas of imitating nature, in rejecting a strait line for the water, and giving its banks the wave of a real stream, should not be extended to hiding the conclusion, by winding it among the wood where it could not be followed; and it would have been a great improvement, to have given the stream in one place a much greater wave, so as to have enlarged it to four times its present width; this would have added much to the variety of the scene. Lastly, I might remark, that the circular bason near the end of the river has a very bad effect; any water so very artificial, should not be seen with the same eye that views the imitation of a real stream.}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|{{coord|53.7804635|-0.41392538|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Kingtree House (site of)}}, Kingtree House, demolished 1960s.<ref name=\"kht\"/>|group=\"map\"}}\n\n{{quote|\"At this place Mr. Watson has a pleasure-ground, which is very well worth seeing; it consists of shrubberies with winding walks, and the imitation of a meandering river through the whole...\"|[[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]| A six months tour through the north of England.<ref name=\"watsonshrub\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Snuff Mill House - geograph.org.uk - 384243.jpg|Snuff Mill House, built 1750 (2007)|thumb|upright]]\n[[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] was manufactured in the south of the village in the 18th&nbsp;century; towards the end of the century a large mill owned by [[Quaker]] William Travis was producing 15&nbsp;hundredweight of snuff per week.<ref name=\"c1797\"/><ref>{{cite book| url =https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea|title= General and concise history and description of the town and port of Kingston-upon-Hull |first = James Joseph |last = Sheahan| publisher = Simpkin, Marshall & Co.| year = 1864| page = [https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea/page/303 303]}}</ref> William Travis had a three storied house built in 1750 next to the mill.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1103397|desc=Snuff Mill House and railings|accessdate=4 December 2012| fewer-links=y}}</ref><ref group=\"map\">{{coord|53.7768|-0.4084|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Snuff Mill House}}, Snuff Mill House</ref>\n\nThe road from Cottingham to Hull connected with the Hull to Beverley Road (turnpiked by Act of 1744) at [[Newland, Kingston upon Hull|Newland]] toll bar; it was turnpiked as an extension of the Hull to Beverley Road in 1764.

At age fifteen, she received a partial scholarship at the [[Interlochen Arts Academy]] in Michigan, where she studied operatic voice. After graduating, she began writing and performing at clubs and coffeehouses in [[San Diego]], California. Based on local media attention, she was offered a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]], who released her debut album, ''[[Pieces of You]]'', in 1995; it went on to become one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, going 12-times platinum. The debut single from the album, \"[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]\", peaked at number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; two others, \"[[You Were Meant for Me (Jewel song)|You Were Meant for Me]]\" and \"[[Foolish Games]]\", reached number two on the Hot 100, and were listed on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1997|1997 year-end singles chart]], as well as ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1998|1998 year-end singles chart]].\n\nHer subsequent album, ''[[Spirit (Jewel album)|Spirit]]'', was released in 1998, followed by ''[[This Way (Jewel album)|This Way]]'' (2001). In 2003, she released ''[[0304]]'', which marked a departure from her previous folk-oriented records, featuring electronic arrangements and elements of [[dance-pop]]. In 2008, she released ''[[Perfectly Clear]]'', her first [[country music|country]] album; it debuted atop ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Country Albums [[Billboard charts|chart]] and featured three singles, \"[[Stronger Woman]]\", \"[[I Do (Jewel song)|I Do]]\", and \"[[Perfectly Clear|'Til It Feels Like Cheating]]\".

She has received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations and, as of 2015, has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.<ref name=varga/>\n\nJewel was raised in [[Homer, Alaska]], where she grew up singing and [[yodeling]] as a duo with her father, a local musician. At age fifteen, she received a partial scholarship at the [[Interlochen Arts Academy]] in Michigan, where she studied operatic voice. After graduating, she began writing and performing at clubs and coffeehouses in [[San Diego]], California. Based on local media attention, she was offered a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]], who released her debut album, ''[[Pieces of You]]'', in 1995; it went on to become one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, going 12-times platinum. The debut single from the album, \"[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]\", peaked at number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; two others, \"[[You Were Meant for Me (Jewel song)|You Were Meant for Me]]\" and \"[[Foolish Games]]\", reached number two on the Hot 100, and were listed on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1997|1997 year-end singles chart]], as well as ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1998|1998 year-end singles chart]].\n\nHer subsequent album, ''[[Spirit (Jewel album)|Spirit]]'', was released in 1998, followed by ''[[This Way (Jewel album)|This Way]]'' (2001). In 2003, she released ''[[0304]]'', which marked a departure from her previous folk-oriented records, featuring electronic arrangements and elements of [[dance-pop]]. In 2008, she released ''[[Perfectly Clear]]'', her first [[country music|country]] album; it debuted atop ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Country Albums [[Billboard charts|chart]] and featured three singles, \"[[Stronger Woman]]\", \"[[I Do (Jewel song)|I Do]]\", and \"[[Perfectly Clear|'Til It Feels Like Cheating]]\".

The ship was laid down by [[Smiths Dock Company|Smiths Dock]] on 25 October 1943, launched on 25 April 1943 and commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Loch Eck'' on 7 November 1944.\n\n==Royal Navy service==\n''Loch Eck'' joined the 10th Escort Group in the [[Western Approaches]] in December 1944 for anti-submarine patrols and support for convoy escorts. In January 1945 the Group was transferred to [[Scapa Flow]] for anti-submarine operations in the [[Faroe Islands|Faeroes]]&ndash;[[Iceland]] Gap. On 3 February she sank the {{GS|U-1279}} north-west of Shetland with her [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] (mortar) after [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] (mortar) attacks by the frigates {{HMS|Bayntun|K310|2}} and {{HMS|Braithwaite|K468|2}}. On 14 February she took part in the sinking of {{GS|U-989||2}}, and on the 17 February of {{GS|U-1278||2}} in the same area.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-15Fr-Loch-LochEck.htm |title=HMS Loch Eck, frigate |work=naval-history.net |last=Mason |first=Geoffrey B. |editor=Gordon Smith |date=2005 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn March the Group was redeployed in the [[English Channel]] and [[South-Western Approaches]] as \"Force 38\". In April ''Loch Eck'' carried out trials of new [[sonobuoy]] submarine detection equipment. On 23 May the ship was attached to [[Rosyth]] Command to support \"[[Operation Doomsday]]\", the reoccupation of Norway. On 1 June she escorted {{GS|U-2529||2}} from [[Kristiansund]] to [[Loch Eriboll]] as part of \"[[Operation Deadlight]]\", returning to Norway on the 6 June as part of the escort for Convoy RN1 taking King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] to Oslo.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\nAfter a refit at the [[Charles Hill & Sons]] shipyard in Bristol in June and July, she sailed for the [[Indian Ocean]] in August, to join the East Indies Escort Force. There she carried out Guard ship and military support duties, as well as the repatriation of military and civilian personnel. She was also present at the formal Japanese surrender of [[Bali]] in February 1946 and at [[Lombok]] in March. She sailed for home in May, but her return to the UK was delayed after a collision in [[Colombo]] with a Navy cutter. She returned to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] to decommission on 13 August 1946.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n==Transfer to New Zealand==\n''Loch Ech'' was one of six Loch-class frigates sold to the Royal New Zealand Navy. Renamed HMNZS ''Hawea'', she was acquired on 7 September 1948, and commissioned on 1 October 1948.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Raymond V B Blackman |title=Jane's Fighting Ships 1963-4, |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston & Co. Ltd |location=London |pages=184}}</ref>\n\nSince the Admiralty named the Loch-class ships after Scottish lakes, the six in [[New Zealand]] service were renamed after New Zealand lakes. [[Lake H\u0101wea]] is a glacial lake located in the [[Central Otago]] region of New Zealand. The name is [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and is thought to refer to a local tribe although the exact meaning is uncertain. ''Hawea'' was the first of [[HMNZS Hawea|three ships with this name]] to serve in the Royal New Zealand Navy.\n\n==Royal New Zealand Navy service==\nAfter commissioning at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] ''Hawea'' sailed for the Mediterranean with three other Loch-class frigates. After exercises with the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] in November, she sailed for [[Auckland]], via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Indian Ocean]], arriving in January 1949 to join the 11th Frigate Flotilla.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\nOn 22 March 1949 ''Hawea'' participated in sinking the coal hulk ''Occident'' in [[Palliser Bay]].\n\nIn 1949 ''Hawea'' carried out patrols in the Pacific, visiting  [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] and [[Samoa]]. After a refit from October to February 1950 she was transferred on loan to 2nd Frigate Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet, with her [[sister ship]] {{Ship|HMNZS|Taupo|F423|2}} joining the flotilla at [[Malta]] in May for Fleet exercises and cruises. She returned to Auckland in November.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n===Korean War===\nThe [[Korean War]] started on 25 June 1950 when [[North Korea]]n forces crossed the 38\u00b0N parallel and invaded [[South Korea]]. The New Zealand Government decided to maintain two frigates in support of a United Nations Naval Force assisting South Korea. ''Hawea''{{'}}s sister ships, {{Ship|HMNZS|Pukaki|F424|2}}  and {{HMNZS|Tutira|F420|2}}, were hurriedly prepared for war service and sailed for [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], their main base in [[Japan]], on 3 July 1950. They did escort and patrol services, often working with Commonwealth, South Korean and other Allied ships, and in support of amphibious landings. The frigates were rotated in turn with the other four Loch frigates.\n\nIn February 1951 ''Hawea'' sailed to [[Kure]], Japan, to join the United Nations Task Force. In May she was deployed for convoy defence, patrol and bombardment duties off the west coast of Korea. On 18 May she shelled a gun position on the coast, the first time that an RNZN ship fired on the enemy. From June to December she provided navigational data for bombardments in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] estuary, shelling rail traffic and maintaining a blockade.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/> On 15 September 1951, ''Hawea'' swamped a {{convert|7.6|m|adj=on}} motor boat which sank in the Han River estuary while navigating swift tidal channels to reach a bombardment position.\n\nIn February 1952 she was relieved by {{ship|HMNZS|Rotoiti|F425|2}}, returning to Auckland on 8 March. She had spent 272 days at sea, steamed 55,000 miles, and fired 21,000 rounds of ammunition. After refit and maintenance at Auckland from April to June she returned to Korea in October for further operations. After the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] of July 1953 she returned to Auckland, arriving there in August.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n===Later service===\nAfter a refit she returned to the 11th Frigate Flotilla in February 1954 for patrols and port visits. In December 1956 she and ''Pukaki'' escorted the supply ship {{ship|HMNZS|Endeavour|1944|2}} in a passage to the [[Southern Ocean]], sailing from [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]] to the edge of the pack ice. ''Endeavour'' was taking Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and members of the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] to make a trans-polar crossing as part of [[International Geophysical Year]].<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n==Decommissioning and fate==\nOn 15 February 1957 ''Hawea'' was decommissioned and put into reserve.

The ship was laid down by [[Smiths Dock Company|Smiths Dock]] on 25 October 1943, launched on 25 April 1943 and commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Loch Eck'' on 7 November 1944.\n\n==Royal Navy service==\n''Loch Eck'' joined the 10th Escort Group in the [[Western Approaches]] in December 1944 for anti-submarine patrols and support for convoy escorts. In January 1945 the Group was transferred to [[Scapa Flow]] for anti-submarine operations in the [[Faroe Islands|Faeroes]]&ndash;[[Iceland]] Gap. On 3 February she sank the {{GS|U-1279}} north-west of Shetland with her [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] (mortar) after [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] (mortar) attacks by the frigates {{HMS|Bayntun|K310|2}} and {{HMS|Braithwaite|K468|2}}. On 14 February she took part in the sinking of {{GS|U-989||2}}, and on the 17 February of {{GS|U-1278||2}} in the same area.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-15Fr-Loch-LochEck.htm |title=HMS Loch Eck, frigate |work=naval-history.net |last=Mason |first=Geoffrey B. |editor=Gordon Smith |date=2005 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn March the Group was redeployed in the [[English Channel]] and [[South-Western Approaches]] as \"Force 38\". In April ''Loch Eck'' carried out trials of new [[sonobuoy]] submarine detection equipment. On 23 May the ship was attached to [[Rosyth]] Command to support \"[[Operation Doomsday]]\", the reoccupation of Norway. On 1 June she escorted {{GS|U-2529||2}} from [[Kristiansund]] to [[Loch Eriboll]] as part of \"[[Operation Deadlight]]\", returning to Norway on the 6 June as part of the escort for Convoy RN1 taking King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] to Oslo.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\nAfter a refit at the [[Charles Hill & Sons]] shipyard in Bristol in June and July, she sailed for the [[Indian Ocean]] in August, to join the East Indies Escort Force. There she carried out Guard ship and military support duties, as well as the repatriation of military and civilian personnel. She was also present at the formal Japanese surrender of [[Bali]] in February 1946 and at [[Lombok]] in March. She sailed for home in May, but her return to the UK was delayed after a collision in [[Colombo]] with a Navy cutter. She returned to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] to decommission on 13 August 1946.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n==Transfer to New Zealand==\n''Loch Ech'' was one of six Loch-class frigates sold to the Royal New Zealand Navy. Renamed HMNZS ''Hawea'', she was acquired on 7 September 1948, and commissioned on 1 October 1948.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Raymond V B Blackman |title=Jane's Fighting Ships 1963-4, |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston & Co. Ltd |location=London |pages=184}}</ref>\n\nSince the Admiralty named the Loch-class ships after Scottish lakes, the six in [[New Zealand]] service were renamed after New Zealand lakes. [[Lake Hawea]] is a glacial lake located in the [[Central Otago]] region of New Zealand. The name is [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and is thought to refer to a local tribe although the exact meaning is uncertain. ''Hawea'' was the first of [[HMNZS Hawea|three ships with this name]] to serve in the Royal New Zealand Navy.\n\n==Royal New Zealand Navy service==\nAfter commissioning at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] ''Hawea'' sailed for the Mediterranean with three other Loch-class frigates. After exercises with the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] in November, she sailed for [[Auckland]], via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Indian Ocean]], arriving in January 1949 to join the 11th Frigate Flotilla.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\nOn 22 March 1949 ''Hawea'' participated in sinking the coal hulk ''Occident'' in [[Palliser Bay]].\n\nIn 1949 ''Hawea'' carried out patrols in the Pacific, visiting  [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] and [[Samoa]]. After a refit from October to February 1950 she was transferred on loan to 2nd Frigate Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet, with her [[sister ship]] {{Ship|HMNZS|Taupo|F423|2}} joining the flotilla at [[Malta]] in May for Fleet exercises and cruises. She returned to Auckland in November.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n===Korean War===\nThe [[Korean War]] started on 25 June 1950 when [[North Korea]]n forces crossed the 38\u00b0N parallel and invaded [[South Korea]]. The New Zealand Government decided to maintain two frigates in support of a United Nations Naval Force assisting South Korea. ''Hawea''{{'}}s sister ships, {{Ship|HMNZS|Pukaki|F424|2}}  and {{HMNZS|Tutira|F420|2}}, were hurriedly prepared for war service and sailed for [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], their main base in [[Japan]], on 3 July 1950. They did escort and patrol services, often working with Commonwealth, South Korean and other Allied ships, and in support of amphibious landings. The frigates were rotated in turn with the other four Loch frigates.\n\nIn February 1951 ''Hawea'' sailed to [[Kure]], Japan, to join the United Nations Task Force. In May she was deployed for convoy defence, patrol and bombardment duties off the west coast of Korea. On 18 May she shelled a gun position on the coast, the first time that an RNZN ship fired on the enemy. From June to December she provided navigational data for bombardments in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] estuary, shelling rail traffic and maintaining a blockade.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/> On 15 September 1951, ''Hawea'' swamped a {{convert|7.6|m|adj=on}} motor boat which sank in the Han River estuary while navigating swift tidal channels to reach a bombardment position.\n\nIn February 1952 she was relieved by {{ship|HMNZS|Rotoiti|F425|2}}, returning to Auckland on 8 March. She had spent 272 days at sea, steamed 55,000 miles, and fired 21,000 rounds of ammunition. After refit and maintenance at Auckland from April to June she returned to Korea in October for further operations. After the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] of July 1953 she returned to Auckland, arriving there in August.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n===Later service===\nAfter a refit she returned to the 11th Frigate Flotilla in February 1954 for patrols and port visits. In December 1956 she and ''Pukaki'' escorted the supply ship {{ship|HMNZS|Endeavour|1944|2}} in a passage to the [[Southern Ocean]], sailing from [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]] to the edge of the pack ice. ''Endeavour'' was taking Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and members of the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] to make a trans-polar crossing as part of [[International Geophysical Year]].<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n==Decommissioning and fate==\nOn 15 February 1957 ''Hawea'' was decommissioned and put into reserve. The ship was used as a Harbour Training ship in Auckland until sold for breaking up in September 1965.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/> On 15 November 1965 ''Hawea'' and sister ship ''Pukaki'' were towed by the tug ''Atlas'' to a [[Ship breaking|breaker's yard]] in [[Hong Kong]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Frigates of the Royal New Zealand Navy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{colledge}}\n* McDougall, R J  (1989) ''New Zealand Naval Vessels.''
