Along with \"[[Wham Rap!

Michael wrote, \"With 'Careless Whisper' I remember exactly where it first came to me, where I came up with the sax line... I remember I was handing the money over to the guy on the bus and I got this line, the sax line...\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Michael |first1=George |authorlink=George Michael |title=Bare |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359 |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |date=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359/page/56 56\u201357]}}</ref>\n\n\"When I was twelve, thirteen, I used to have to [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]] my sister, who was two years older, to an ice rink at [[Queensway, London|Queensway]] in London,\" he detailed. \"There was a girl there with long blond hair whose name was Jane.

She had moved in right next to where I used to stand and wait for my next-door neighbour, who used to give me a lift home from school. And one day I saw her walk down the path next to me and I thought \u2013 now where did SHE come from? She didn't know it was me. It was a few years later and I looked a lot different. Then we played a school disco with The Executive and she saw me singing and decided she fancied me. By this time she was that much older and a big buxom thing \u2013 and eventually I started seeing her. She invited me in one day when I was waiting for my lift and I was ... in heaven.<ref name=\"bare\" /></blockquote>\n\nMichael observed that after he stopped wearing glasses, he began getting invited to parties. \"And the girl who didn't even see me when I was twelve invited me in\", he noted.\n\n<blockquote>So I went out with her for a couple of months but I didn't stop seeing Helen. I thought I was being smart \u2013 I had gone from being a total loser to being a two-timer. And I remember my sisters used to give me a hard time because they found out and they really liked the first girl. The whole idea of \"Careless Whisper\" was the first girl finding out about the second \u2013 which she never did. But I started another relationship with a girl called Alexis without finishing the one with Jane. It all got a bit complicated. Jane found out about her and got rid of me ... The whole time I thought I was being cool, being this two-timer, but there really wasn't that much emotion involved. I did feel guilty about the first girl \u2013 and I have seen her since \u2013 and the idea of the song was about her. \"Careless Whisper\" was us dancing, because we danced a lot, and the idea was \u2013 we are dancing ... but she knows ... and it's finished.<ref name=\"bare\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Production ==\n{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Careless Whisper Jerry Wexler version.ogg\n|title=\"Careless Whisper (Jerry Wexler Version)\"|description=Michael wasn't happy with the original Wexler recording.|format=[[Ogg]]|}}\nThe song went through at least two rounds of production. The first was during a trip Michael made to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], where he went to work with producer [[Jerry Wexler]] at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Corey |first=Russ |url=https://www.timesdaily.com/news/solo-version-of-careless-whisper-recorded-in-the-shoals/article_47c2fcd7-2780-5f6d-847a-828ad928f062.html |title=Solo version of 'Careless Whisper' recorded in the Shoals |work=[[TimesDaily]] |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> Michael was unhappy with the original version produced by Wexler, and decided to re-record and produce the song himself; the second version was the one ultimately released as a single.\n\nAfter the backing track and George's vocal had been recorded, Wexler had booked the top saxophone player from Los Angeles to fly in and do the solo.<ref name=\"Simon\">{{cite book |last=Napier-Bell |first1=Simon |title=Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay: The Dodgy Business of Popular Music |chapter-url=http://skrufff.com/2013/08/simon-napier-bell-george-michael-recording-careless-whisper/ |publisher=Random House UK |chapter=Simon Napier-Bell: George Michael & Recording Careless Whisper|date=2015 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> \"He arrived at eleven and should have been gone by twelve\", recalled Wham! manager [[Simon Napier-Bell]]. \"Instead, after two hours, he was still there while everyone in the studio shuddered with embarrassment. He just couldn't play the opening riff the way George wanted it, the way it had been on the demo. But that had been made two years earlier by a friend of George's who lived round the corner and played sax for fun in the pub.\"<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\n[[File:Concert_model_Selmer_Mark_VI.jpeg|thumb|left|The saxophone solo was performed on a [[Selmer Mark VI]] tenor by [[Steve Gregory]].]]\n\nWhile the saxophonist appeared to be playing the part perfectly, Michael told him, \"No, it's still not right, you see{{nbsp}}...\" and he would lower his head to the talkback microphone and patiently hum the part to him yet again. \"It has to twitch upwards a little just there! See{{nbsp}}...? And not too much.\"<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\nNapier-Bell consulted with Wexler over Michael's dispute with the sax sound. \"Is there really something George wants that's different from what the sax player is playing?\" Napier-Bell asked.<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\n\"Definitely!\" replied Wexler.\n\n<blockquote>I've seen things like this before. There's some tiny nuance that the sax player is somehow not getting right. Although you and I can't hear what it is, it may be the very thing that will make the record a hit. The success of pop records is so ephemeral, so unbelievably unpredictable, we just can't take the risk of being impatient. But this sax player's not going to get it, is he!<ref name=\"Simon\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe version Wexler produced was released later in the year, as a (4:41) B-side \"Special Version\" on 12\" in the UK and Japan.\n\nThe record label [[Innervision Records|Innervision]] were going to put out the Wexler version of \"Careless Whisper\" after the [[Club Fantastic Megamix]] as far back as 1983. Song publisher Dick Leahy said that while he could not stop the release of the Club Fantastic Megamix, he could stop the release of this single on the basis that as a publisher they \"have the right to grant the first license of the recording of a tune of which he controls the copyright\". He was unable to do anything about the Club Fantastic Megamix because it was already released material. He said: \"We knew how big that song could be, so it was necessary to upset a few people to stop it.\"<ref name=\"Michael 1991 166\">{{cite book |last=Michael |first1=George |authorlink=George Michael |title=Bare |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359 |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |date=1991 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359/page/166 166]}}</ref>\n\nMichael later went back to London's [[Sarm West Studios|Sarm West]]'s Studio 2 to rework the track.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buskin |first=Richard |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-george-michael-faith |title=Classic Tracks: George Michael 'Faith' |work=Sound on Sound |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2018 }}</ref> According to English [[jazz]] musician [[Dan Forshaw]], saxophonist [[Steve Gregory]] had received a call to re-record the song's distinctive solo; he was the eleventh saxophone player to record the solo, for Michael was determined to get the sound he wanted.<ref name=\"Dan-Forshaw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/cambridgesaxophone/posts/careless-whisper-was-a-hit-for-george-michael-way-back-in-1984-its-stunning-sax-/152100958246679/ |title=Cambridge Saxophone |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> \"Session musicians do not have much idea what they are going to be recording until they arrive, and this was the case for Steve and another saxophonist who was ahead of him in the ([[Queue area|queue]])\", Forshaw recalled.\n\n<blockquote>As usual there was a lot of waiting around and the guy in front of Steve threw in the towel saying, 'it's only going to be some crappy B side anyway so I'm off'. Steve waited and then discovered that the solo wasn't that easy to play in the written key, as his old [[Selmer Mark VI]] tenor didn't have a top F# key. So, the engineer slowed the tape down so that Steve could record the solo a [[semitone]] lower than intended. Once the tape was put back to the normal speed, a 'unnatural' saxophone sound was created that sounded a bit like an Alto in the [[Paul Desmond]] vibe, but lacking a bit more depth and darkness to the sound. George Michael had just arrived at the studio and said 'that's the one, that's the sax solo I want'. This could be down to that whole 80s [[Synthesizer|synth]] concept where sounds became increasingly 'manufactured', or just that George never recognized it was 'wrong'.<ref name=\"Dan-Forshaw\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe officially released single was issued in August 1984, entering the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 12. Within two weeks it was at [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1980s#1984|number one]], ending a nine-week run at the top for \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]. It stayed at number one for three weeks, going on to become the fifth best-selling single of 1984 in the United Kingdom; outsold only by the two Frankie Goes to Hollywood tracks, \"Two Tribes\" and \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\", Stevie Wonder with \"[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]\", and Band Aid's \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\". The song also topped the charts in 25 other countries, including the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in February 1985 under the credit \"Wham! featuring George Michael\", Spending three weeks at the top in America, the song was later named ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1985|number-one song of 1985]]. The song was #1 on the smooth radio top 500 songs of all time chart-proving it's iconic status.  \n\nDespite the success, Michael was never fond of the song. He said in 1991 that it \"was not an integral part of my emotional development ... it disappoints me that you can write a lyric very flippantly\u2014and not a particularly good lyric\u2014and it can mean so much to so many people. That's disillusioning for a writer.\"<ref name=\"Michael 1991 166\" />\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video (which uses the shorter single version instead of the full album version and was directed by Duncan Gibbins, who previously directed \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\") shows the guilt felt by a man (portrayed by Michael) over an affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner ([[Lisa Stahl]]) is going to find out. It was filmed on location in [[Miami]], Florida, in 1984 and features such locales as [[Coconut Grove]] and [[Watson Island]]. The final part of the video shows Michael leaning out of a balcony at the last floor of Miami's Grove Towers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=coconut%20grove,%20miami&aq=&sll=41.442726,12.392578&sspn=12.67371,28.256836&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Coconut%20Grove,%20Miami,%20Contea%20di%20Miami-Dade,%20Florida,%20Stati%20Uniti&t=h&ll=25.728402,-80.238988&spn=0,0.001725&z=19&layer=c&cbll=25.728002,-80.239051&panoid=20UBlcs6h09ClXZCu36ClQ&cbp=12,41.59,,0,-33.64 |title=Google Maps |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=georgemichaelVEVO |title=George Michael \u2013 Careless Whisper (Official Video) |date=25 October 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izGwDsrQ1eQ |accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nA first original version of the video was edited with the Jerry Wexler 1983 version, and featured Andrew as a cameo, handing over a letter to a dark-haired George.

It was released on 24 July 1984 on the Wham! album ''[[Make It Big]]''. \n\nThe song features a prominent [[saxophone]] [[riff]], and has been covered by a number of artists since its first release. It was released as a single and became a huge commercial success around the world. It reached number one in nearly 25 countries, selling about 6&nbsp;million copies worldwide\u20142&nbsp;million of them in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10139404/George-Michael-50-years-in-numbers.html |title=George Michael: 50 years in numbers |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Careless Whisper - Wham!.ogg|title=\"Careless Whisper\"|description=The composition features a distinctive tenor sax solo performed by [[Steve Gregory]].|format=[[Ogg]]|}}\n\n=== Composition and writing ===\nThe song was the third Wham! song to be written, in 1981 before the band (or band name) had been fully formed. Along with \"[[Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)|Wham Rap!]]\" and \"[[Club Tropicana]]\", it was one of the three demo tracks recorded in Ridgeley's front room, which secured them their record deal with [[Innervision Records|Innervision]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ridgeley |first1=Andrew |title=Wham!

Michael wrote, \"With 'Careless Whisper' I remember exactly where it first came to me, where I came up with the sax line... I remember I was handing the money over to the guy on the bus and I got this line, the sax line...\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Michael |first1=George |authorlink=George Michael |title=Bare |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359 |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |date=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359/page/56 56\u201357]}}</ref>\n\n\"When I was twelve, thirteen, I used to have to [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]] my sister, who was two years older, to an ice rink at [[Queensway, London|Queensway]] in London,\" he detailed. \"There was a girl there with long blond hair whose name was Jane. I was a fat boy in glasses and I had a big crush on her - though I didn't stand a chance. My sister used to go and do what she wanted when we got to the skating rink and I would spend the afternoon swooning over this girl Jane.\"<ref name=\"bare\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359|title=Bare|last=Michael|first1=George|date=1991|publisher=Penguin|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359/page/128 128\u2013129]|authorlink=George Michael|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n\"A few years later, when I was sixteen, I had my first relationship with a girl called Helen\", Michael continued.\n\n<blockquote>It had just started to cool off a bit when I discovered that the blonde girl from Queensway had moved in just around the corner from my school. She had moved in right next to where I used to stand and wait for my next-door neighbour, who used to give me a lift home from school. And one day I saw her walk down the path next to me and I thought \u2013 now where did SHE come from? She didn't know it was me. It was a few years later and I looked a lot different. Then we played a school disco with The Executive and she saw me singing and decided she fancied me. By this time she was that much older and a big buxom thing \u2013 and eventually I started seeing her. She invited me in one day when I was waiting for my lift and I was ... in heaven.<ref name=\"bare\" /></blockquote>\n\nMichael observed that after he stopped wearing glasses, he began getting invited to parties. \"And the girl who didn't even see me when I was twelve invited me in\", he noted.\n\n<blockquote>So I went out with her for a couple of months but I didn't stop seeing Helen. I thought I was being smart \u2013 I had gone from being a total loser to being a two-timer. And I remember my sisters used to give me a hard time because they found out and they really liked the first girl. The whole idea of \"Careless Whisper\" was the first girl finding out about the second \u2013 which she never did. But I started another relationship with a girl called Alexis without finishing the one with Jane. It all got a bit complicated. Jane found out about her and got rid of me ... The whole time I thought I was being cool, being this two-timer, but there really wasn't that much emotion involved. I did feel guilty about the first girl \u2013 and I have seen her since \u2013 and the idea of the song was about her. \"Careless Whisper\" was us dancing, because we danced a lot, and the idea was \u2013 we are dancing ... but she knows ... and it's finished.<ref name=\"bare\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Production ==\n{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Careless Whisper Jerry Wexler version.ogg\n|title=\"Careless Whisper (Jerry Wexler Version)\"|description=Michael wasn't happy with the original Wexler recording.|format=[[Ogg]]|}}\nThe song went through at least two rounds of production. The first was during a trip Michael made to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], where he went to work with producer [[Jerry Wexler]] at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Corey |first=Russ |url=https://www.timesdaily.com/news/solo-version-of-careless-whisper-recorded-in-the-shoals/article_47c2fcd7-2780-5f6d-847a-828ad928f062.html |title=Solo version of 'Careless Whisper' recorded in the Shoals |work=[[TimesDaily]] |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> Michael was unhappy with the original version produced by Wexler, and decided to re-record and produce the song himself; the second version was the one ultimately released as a single.\n\nAfter the backing track and George's vocal had been recorded, Wexler had booked the top saxophone player from Los Angeles to fly in and do the solo.<ref name=\"Simon\">{{cite book |last=Napier-Bell |first1=Simon |title=Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay: The Dodgy Business of Popular Music |chapter-url=http://skrufff.com/2013/08/simon-napier-bell-george-michael-recording-careless-whisper/ |publisher=Random House UK |chapter=Simon Napier-Bell: George Michael & Recording Careless Whisper|date=2015 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> \"He arrived at eleven and should have been gone by twelve\", recalled Wham! manager [[Simon Napier-Bell]]. \"Instead, after two hours, he was still there while everyone in the studio shuddered with embarrassment. He just couldn't play the opening riff the way George wanted it, the way it had been on the demo. But that had been made two years earlier by a friend of George's who lived round the corner and played sax for fun in the pub.\"<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\n[[File:Concert_model_Selmer_Mark_VI.jpeg|thumb|left|The saxophone solo was performed on a [[Selmer Mark VI]] tenor by [[Steve Gregory]].]]\n\nWhile the saxophonist appeared to be playing the part perfectly, Michael told him, \"No, it's still not right, you see{{nbsp}}...\" and he would lower his head to the talkback microphone and patiently hum the part to him yet again. \"It has to twitch upwards a little just there! See{{nbsp}}...? And not too much.\"<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\nNapier-Bell consulted with Wexler over Michael's dispute with the sax sound. \"Is there really something George wants that's different from what the sax player is playing?\" Napier-Bell asked.<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n\n\"Definitely!\" replied Wexler.\n\n<blockquote>I've seen things like this before. There's some tiny nuance that the sax player is somehow not getting right. Although you and I can't hear what it is, it may be the very thing that will make the record a hit. The success of pop records is so ephemeral, so unbelievably unpredictable, we just can't take the risk of being impatient. But this sax player's not going to get it, is he!<ref name=\"Simon\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe version Wexler produced was released later in the year, as a (4:41) B-side \"Special Version\" on 12\" in the UK and Japan.\n\nThe record label [[Innervision Records|Innervision]] were going to put out the Wexler version of \"Careless Whisper\" after the [[Club Fantastic Megamix]] as far back as 1983. Song publisher Dick Leahy said that while he could not stop the release of the Club Fantastic Megamix, he could stop the release of this single on the basis that as a publisher they \"have the right to grant the first license of the recording of a tune of which he controls the copyright\". He was unable to do anything about the Club Fantastic Megamix because it was already released material. He said: \"We knew how big that song could be, so it was necessary to upset a few people to stop it.\"<ref name=\"Michael 1991 166\">{{cite book |last=Michael |first1=George |authorlink=George Michael |title=Bare |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359 |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |date=1991 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140132359/page/166 166]}}</ref>\n\nMichael later went back to London's [[Sarm West Studios|Sarm West]]'s Studio 2 to rework the track.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buskin |first=Richard |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-george-michael-faith |title=Classic Tracks: George Michael 'Faith' |work=Sound on Sound |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2018 }}</ref> According to English [[jazz]] musician [[Dan Forshaw]], saxophonist [[Steve Gregory]] had received a call to re-record the song's distinctive solo; he was the eleventh saxophone player to record the solo, for Michael was determined to get the sound he wanted.<ref name=\"Dan-Forshaw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/cambridgesaxophone/posts/careless-whisper-was-a-hit-for-george-michael-way-back-in-1984-its-stunning-sax-/152100958246679/ |title=Cambridge Saxophone |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> \"Session musicians do not have much idea what they are going to be recording until they arrive, and this was the case for Steve and another saxophonist who was ahead of him in the ([[Queue area|queue]])\", Forshaw recalled.\n\n<blockquote>As usual there was a lot of waiting around and the guy in front of Steve threw in the towel saying, 'it's only going to be some crappy B side anyway so I'm off'. Steve waited and then discovered that the solo wasn't that easy to play in the written key, as his old [[Selmer Mark VI]] tenor didn't have a top F# key. So, the engineer slowed the tape down so that Steve could record the solo a [[semitone]] lower than intended. Once the tape was put back to the normal speed, a 'unnatural' saxophone sound was created that sounded a bit like an Alto in the [[Paul Desmond]] vibe, but lacking a bit more depth and darkness to the sound. George Michael had just arrived at the studio and said 'that's the one, that's the sax solo I want'. This could be down to that whole 80s [[Synthesizer|synth]] concept where sounds became increasingly 'manufactured', or just that George never recognized it was 'wrong'.<ref name=\"Dan-Forshaw\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe officially released single was issued in August 1984, entering the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 12. Within two weeks it was at [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1980s#1984|number one]], ending a nine-week run at the top for \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]. It stayed at number one for three weeks, going on to become the fifth best-selling single of 1984 in the United Kingdom; outsold only by the two Frankie Goes to Hollywood tracks, \"Two Tribes\" and \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\", Stevie Wonder with \"[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]\", and Band Aid's \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\". The song also topped the charts in 25 other countries, including the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in February 1985 under the credit \"Wham! featuring George Michael\", Spending three weeks at the top in America, the song was later named ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1985|number-one song of 1985]]. The song was #1 on the smooth radio top 500 songs of all time chart-proving it\u2019s iconic status.  \n\nDespite the success, Michael was never fond of the song. He said in 1991 that it \"was not an integral part of my emotional development ... it disappoints me that you can write a lyric very flippantly\u2014and not a particularly good lyric\u2014and it can mean so much to so many people. That's disillusioning for a writer.\"<ref name=\"Michael 1991 166\" />\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video (which uses the shorter single version instead of the full album version and was directed by Duncan Gibbins, who previously directed \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\") shows the guilt felt by a man (portrayed by Michael) over an affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner ([[Lisa Stahl]]) is going to find out. It was filmed on location in [[Miami]], Florida, in 1984 and features such locales as [[Coconut Grove]] and [[Watson Island]].

The first installment in the ''Jumping Flash!'' series, it was first released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on 28 April 1995 in Japan, 29 September 1995 in Europe and 1 November 1995 in North America. It was re-released through the [[PlayStation Network]] store on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2007.\n\nPresented in a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], the game follows a robotic rabbit named \"Robbit\" as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game's [[astrophysicist]] antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a [[technology demonstration|technology demonstrator]] for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of \"Spring Man\". ''Jumping Flash!'' utilises much of the [[game engine]] used in ''[[Geograph Seal]]'', an earlier game by Exact for the [[X68000|Sharp X68000]] home computer.\n\n''Jumping Flash!'' has been described as an ancestor of as well as an early showcase for [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] in [[Video game console|console gaming]]. It was generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique 3D platforming gameplay, but it was eventually overshadowed by later 3D platformers of the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth console generation]]. ''Jumping Flash!'' spawned two sequels: ''[[Jumping Flash! 2]]'' and ''[[Robbit Mon Dieu]]''. It received overwhelmingly positive reviews at the time of release, and made an appearance in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''{{'}}s \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" just one year after. The game was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of [[IGN]] in 2007. It also holds the [[Guinness World Record]] as the \"first platform video game in true 3D\".\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Jumping Flash gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|A still image from the first level.

The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate the [[virtual camera system|camera]] in any direction. The top part of the screen shows the remaining time, the player's score, and a character named Kumagoro\u2014Robbit's sidekick [[artificial intelligence]] who offers the player warnings and hints.{{sfn|Exact|1995|p=5}} The top left corner of the screen shows the collected [[power-up]]s; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles.

The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.{{sfn|Exact|1995|p=8}}\n\nThe core of the gameplay is focused on the player's ability to make Robbit jump.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solving the 3D platforming problem in Jumping Flash|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117190711/http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/05/solving-the-3d-platforming-problem-in-jumping-flash/|archivedate=17 November 2015|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/12/05/solving-the-3d-platforming-problem-in-jumping-flash/ |date=5 December 2012 |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=5 November 2015 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref> Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights.<ref name=\"Joystiq\">{{cite web|title=Retro Review: Jumping Flash!

The first installment in the ''Jumping Flash!'' series, it was first released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on 28 April 1995 in Japan, 29 September 1995 in Europe and 1 November 1995 in North America. It was re-released through the [[PlayStation Network]] store on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2007.\n\nPresented in a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], the game follows a robotic rabbit named \"Robbit\" as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game's [[astrophysicist]] antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a [[technology demonstration|technology demonstrator]] for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of \"Spring Man\". ''Jumping Flash!'' utilises much of the [[game engine]] used in ''[[Geograph Seal]]'', an earlier game by Exact for the [[X68000|Sharp X68000]] home computer.\n\n''Jumping Flash!'' has been described as an ancestor of as well as an early showcase for [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] in [[Video game console|console gaming]]. It was generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique 3D platforming gameplay, but it was eventually overshadowed by later 3D platformers of the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth console generation]]. ''Jumping Flash!'' spawned two sequels: ''[[Jumping Flash! 2]]'' and ''[[Robbit Mon Dieu]]''. It received overwhelmingly positive reviews at the time of release, and made an appearance in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''{{'}}s \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" just one year after. The game was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of [[IGN]] in 2007. It also holds the [[Guinness World Record]] as the \"first platform video game in true 3D\".\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Jumping Flash gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|A still image from the first level.

The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate the [[virtual camera system|camera]] in any direction.

The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.{{sfn|Exact|1995|p=8}}\n\nThe core of the gameplay is focused on the player's ability to make Robbit jump.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solving the 3D platforming problem in Jumping Flash|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117190711/http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/05/solving-the-3d-platforming-problem-in-jumping-flash/|archivedate=17 November 2015|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/12/05/solving-the-3d-platforming-problem-in-jumping-flash/ |date=5 December 2012 |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=5 November 2015 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref> Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights.<ref name=\"Joystiq\">{{cite web|title=Retro Review: Jumping Flash!
