''Trollhunter'' received positive reviews from Norwegian critics. It opened on 10 June 2011 in the US<ref name=\"fji\"/> to a mostly positive critical reception.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of students from [[Volda University College]], Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna M\u00f8rck) and their cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), set out to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher, Hans ([[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]]). At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen ([[Hans Morten Hansen]]), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and bitten by a large animal. They escape in Hans's [[Land Rover]] and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that he does not hunt bears, but [[troll]]s. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do as he instructs.\n\nThe next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and checks if any of them believe in [[God]] or [[Jesus]], because a troll can smell a [[Christians|Christian]] man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful [[Ultraviolet|UV-rays]] to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\". The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll. Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to try to determine why.\n\nThe students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of trolls. The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation gets more tense as Kalle confesses that he is a Christian. The trolls eventually smell Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is killed.\n\nThe replacement camerawoman is Malica, a [[Muslim]]; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a [[J\u00f6tunn|Jotnar]], a giant mountain troll 50\u2013100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for [[rabies]]; Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.\n\nAfter several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. He directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his government agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and is seen collapsing at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black a truck is seen stopping next to the camera. Presumably the driver is the person who \"found the footage\". An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice.<ref name=\"Eggertson\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/24457/interview-andre-ovredal-director-of-trollhunter |title=Interview: Andre Ovredal, Director of 'TrollHunter'!! |first=Chris |last=Eggertsen |work=Bloody Disgusting |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]] as Hans the trollhunter\n* [[Hans Morten Hansen]] as Finn\n* Tomas Alf Larsen as Kalle\n* Johanna M\u00f8rck as Johanna\n* [[Knut N\u00e6rum]] as a power company manager\n* [[Robert Stoltenberg]] as a Polish bear hunter\n* Glenn Erland Tosterud as Thomas\n* Urmila Berg-Domaas as Malica\n* Torunn L\u00f8demel Stokkeland as Hilda, a veterinarian\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in the forests and mountains of [[Western Norway]], and actress Johanna M\u00f8rck called it an exhausting experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article5363731.ece |title=Som et eventyr \u00e5 v\u00e6re med p\u00e5 |last=\u00d8deg\u00e5rd |first=Espen |work=[[Ringerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> According to director Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal, the team tried to maintain maximum secrecy around the project.

The most well-known is probably the Mountain King, which is mentioned in the play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[In the Hall of the Mountain King|its music]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]. The Norwegian name for Mountain King, ''Dovregubbe'', is a compound word whose first part is used in the name for the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]] where the characters meet the final troll.<ref>{{cite book |title=Found Footage Horror Films : Fear and the Appearance of Reality |publisher=McFarland & Company |last=Heller-Nicholas |first=Alexandra |year=2014 |page=188 |isbn=9781476613215 }}</ref>\n\nOther common [[Troll#Scandinavian folklore|troll descriptions]] from the Norwegian folklore which are used in the film include trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. The latter is a point emphasised in the film, as Hans uses UV light to kill the trolls. However, he also states that not everything from the tales is true.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/294439003 |title=Trolls in Film: Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Bann |first1=Jenny |last2=Weinstock |first2=Jeffrey Andrew |year=2014 |page=548 |isbn=9781409425632 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Gothic Topographies: Language, Nation Building and 'Race' |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Leffler |first1=Yvonne |editor-last1=Savolainen |editor-first1=Matti |editor-last2=Mehtonen |editor-first2=P.

For example [[The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll]] when the camera man asks about an eating contest, and the [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]] when Hans attempts to lure a troll from under a bridge using three goats. The fairy tale [[Soria Moria Castle]] is one of the tales that tells about trolls being able to smell a Christian man's blood. A painting by [[Theodor Kittelsen]] based on the same fairy tale is also used as a backdrop on one of the trips they do in the film (Thomas stands in the same pose and asks his friends \"Do I look like that famous painting?\").

''Trollhunter'' received positive reviews from Norwegian critics. It opened on 10 June 2011 in the US<ref name=\"fji\"/> to a mostly positive critical reception.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of students from [[Volda University College]], Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna M\u00f8rck) and their cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), set out to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher, Hans ([[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]]). At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen ([[Hans Morten Hansen]]), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and bitten by a large animal. They escape in Hans's [[Land Rover]] and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that he does not hunt bears, but [[troll]]s. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do as he instructs.\n\nThe next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and checks if any of them believe in [[God]] or [[Jesus]], because a troll can smell a [[Christians|Christian]] man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful [[Ultraviolet|UV-rays]] to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\". The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll. Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to try to determine why.\n\nThe students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of trolls. The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation gets more tense as Kalle confesses that he is a Christian. The trolls eventually smell Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is killed.\n\nThe replacement camerawoman is Malica, a [[Muslim]]; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a [[J\u00f6tunn|Jotnar]], a giant mountain troll 50\u2013100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for [[rabies]]; Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.\n\nAfter several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. He directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his government agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and is seen collapsing at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black a truck is seen stopping next to the camera. Presumably the driver is the person who \"found the footage\". An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice.<ref name=\"Eggertson\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/24457/interview-andre-ovredal-director-of-trollhunter |title=Interview: Andre Ovredal, Director of 'TrollHunter'!! |first=Chris |last=Eggertsen |work=Bloody Disgusting |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]] as Hans the trollhunter\n* [[Hans Morten Hansen]] as Finn\n* Tomas Alf Larsen as Kalle\n* Johanna M\u00f8rck as Johanna\n* [[Knut N\u00e6rum]] as a power company manager\n* [[Robert Stoltenberg]] as a Polish bear hunter\n* Glenn Erland Tosterud as Thomas\n* Urmila Berg-Domaas as Malica\n* Torunn L\u00f8demel Stokkeland as Hilda, a veterinarian\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in the forests and mountains of [[Western Norway]], and actress Johanna M\u00f8rck called it an exhausting experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article5363731.ece |title=Som et eventyr \u00e5 v\u00e6re med p\u00e5 |last=\u00d8deg\u00e5rd |first=Espen |work=[[Ringerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> According to director Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal, the team tried to maintain maximum secrecy around the project.

The most well-known is probably the Mountain King, which is mentioned in the play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[In the Hall of the Mountain King|its music]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]. The Norwegian name for Mountain King, ''Dovregubbe'', is a compound word whose first part is used in the name for the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]] where the characters meet the final troll.<ref>{{cite book |title=Found Footage Horror Films : Fear and the Appearance of Reality |publisher=McFarland & Company |last=Heller-Nicholas |first=Alexandra |year=2014 |page=188 |isbn=9781476613215 }}</ref>\n\nOther common [[Troll#Scandinavian folklore|troll descriptions]] from the Norwegian folklore which are used in the film include trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. The latter is a point emphasised in the film, as Hans uses UV light to kill the trolls. However, he also states that not everything from the tales is true.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/294439003 |title=Trolls in Film: Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Bann |first1=Jenny |last2=Weinstock |first2=Jeffrey Andrew |year=2014 |page=548 |isbn=9781409425632 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Gothic Topographies: Language, Nation Building and 'Race' |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Leffler |first1=Yvonne |editor-last1=Savolainen |editor-first1=Matti |editor-last2=Mehtonen |editor-first2=P.

For example [[The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll]] when the camera man asks about an eating contest, and the [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]] when Hans attempts to lure a troll from under a bridge using three goats. The fairy tale [[Soria Moria Castle]] is one of the tales that tells about trolls being able to smell a Christian man's blood.

While for piecewise smooth surfaces there is a unique natural notion of surface area, if a surface is very irregular, or rough, then it may not be possible to assign an area to it at all. A typical example is given by a surface with spikes spread throughout in a dense fashion. Many surfaces of this type occur in the study of [[fractal]]s. Extensions of the notion of area which partially fulfill its function and may be defined even for very badly irregular surfaces are studied in [[geometric measure theory]]. A specific example of such an extension is the [[Minkowski content]] of the surface.\n\n== Common formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Surface areas of common solids\n|-\n!Shape\n!Equation\n!Variables\n|-\n|[[Cube]]\n|<math> 6s^2 \\, </math>\n|''s'' = side length\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]\n|<math> 2(\\ell w + \\ell h + wh) \\, </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Triangular prism]]\n|<math> bh + l(a + b + c) </math>\n|''b'' = base length of triangle, ''h'' = height of triangle, ''l'' = distance between triangular bases, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' = sides of triangle\n|-\n|All [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]]\n|<math> 2B + Ph \\, </math>\n|''B'' = the area of one base, ''P'' = the perimeter of one base, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Sphere]]\n|<math> 4\\pi r^2 = \\pi d^2\\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''d'' = diameter\n|-\n|[[Spherical lune]]\n|<math> 2r^2\\theta \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''\u03b8'' = [[dihedral angle]]\n|-\n|[[Torus]]\n|<math> (2\\pi r)(2\\pi R) = 4\\pi^2 Rr</math>\n|''r'' = minor radius (radius of the tube), ''R'' = major radius (distance from center of tube to center of torus)\n|-\n|Closed [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n|<math> 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh = 2\\pi r(r+h) \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of the circular base, ''h'' = height of the cylinder\n|-\n|Lateral surface area of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi rs \\, </math>\n|<math> s = \\sqrt{r^2+h^2} </math><br/>\n''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|Full surface area of a cone\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(r + \\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi r(r + s) \\, </math>\n| ''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|[[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]]\n|<math>B + \\frac{PL}{2}</math>\n|''B'' = area of base, ''P'' = perimeter of base, ''L'' = slant height\n|-\n|[[Square pyramid]]\n|<math> b^2 + 2bs = b^2 + 2b\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''b'' = base length, ''s'' = slant height, ''h'' = vertical height\n|-\n|Rectangular pyramid\n|<math> lw + l\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} + w\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Tetrahedron]]\n|<math> \\sqrt{3}a^2 </math>\n|''a'' = side length\n|}\n\n===Ratio of surface areas of a sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height===\n[[Image:Inscribed cone sphere cylinder.svg|thumb|300px|A cone, sphere and cylinder of radius ''r'' and height ''h''.]]\nThe below given formulas can be used to show that the surface area of a [[sphere]] and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same radius and height are in the ratio '''2&nbsp;:&nbsp;3''', as follows.\n\nLet the radius be ''r'' and the height be ''h'' (which is 2''r'' for the sphere).\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{rlll}\n\\text{Sphere surface area}   & = 4 \\pi r^2      &                    & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 2 \\\\\n\\text{Cylinder surface area} & = 2 \\pi r (h + r) & = 2 \\pi r (2r + r) & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 3\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe discovery of this ratio is credited to [[Archimedes]].<ref>{{cite web|first = Chris|last = Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|access-date = 2007-01-02|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209201723/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|archive-date = 2006-12-09|df = }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In chemistry ==\n[[File:Surface area.svg|thumb|Surface area of particles of different sizes.]]\n{{see also|Accessible surface area}}\nSurface area is important in [[chemical kinetics]]. Increasing the surface area of a substance generally increases the [[reaction rate|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]].  For example, [[iron]] in a fine powder will [[combustion|combust]], while in solid blocks it is stable enough to use in structures. For different applications a minimal or maximal surface area may be desired.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In biology ==\n{{see also|Surface-area-to-volume ratio}}\n[[Image:Mitochondrion 186.jpg|right|thumb|The inner membrane of the [[mitochondrion]] has a large surface area due to infoldings, allowing higher rates of [[cellular respiration]] (electron [[micrograph]]).]]\nThe surface area of an organism is important in several considerations, such as regulation of body temperature and [[digestion]]. Animals use their [[teeth]] to grind food down into smaller particles, increasing the surface area available for digestion. The epithelial tissue lining the digestive tract contains [[microvilli]], greatly increasing the area available for absorption. [[Elephant]]s have large [[ear]]s, allowing them to regulate their own body temperature. In other instances, animals will need to minimize surface area; for example, people will fold their arms over their chest when cold to minimize heat loss.\n\nThe [[surface area to volume ratio]] (SA:V) of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the [[cell membrane]] to interstitial spaces or to other cells. Indeed, representing a cell as an idealized [[sphere]] of radius ''r'', the volume and surface area are, respectively, ''V'' = 4/3 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>3</sup>; ''SA'' = 4 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>2</sup>. The resulting surface area to volume ratio is therefore 3/''r''. Th doobeedoobee stoner us, if a cell has a radius of 1 \u03bcm, the SA:V ratio is 3; whereas if the radius of the cell is instead 10 \u03bcm, then the SA:V ratio becomes 0.3. With a cell radius of 100, SA:V ratio is 0.03. Thus, the surface area falls off steeply with increasing volume.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perimeter length]]\n* [[BET theory]], technique for the measurement of the specific surface area of materials\n* [[Spherical area]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n* {{eom|title=Area|id=A/a013180|author=Yu.D.

In particular it doesn't converge to the area of the cylinder.]]One of the subtleties of surface area, as compared to [[arc length]] of curves, is that surface area cannot be defined simply as the limit of areas of polyhedral shapes approximating a given smooth surface. It was demonstrated by [[Hermann Schwarz]] that already for the cylinder, different choices of approximating flat surfaces can lead to different limiting values of the area; this example is known as the [[Schwarz lantern]].<ref name=sch1>{{cite web|url=http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/schwarz-paradox.pdf|title=Schwarz's Paradox|publisher=|date=|access-date=2017-03-21|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073957/http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/schwarz-paradox.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|df=}}</ref><ref name=sch2>{{cite web |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Polya/00494925.di020678.02p0385w.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215152255/http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Polya/00494925.di020678.02p0385w.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVarious approaches to a general definition of surface area were developed in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]]. While for piecewise smooth surfaces there is a unique natural notion of surface area, if a surface is very irregular, or rough, then it may not be possible to assign an area to it at all. A typical example is given by a surface with spikes spread throughout in a dense fashion. Many surfaces of this type occur in the study of [[fractal]]s. Extensions of the notion of area which partially fulfill its function and may be defined even for very badly irregular surfaces are studied in [[geometric measure theory]]. A specific example of such an extension is the [[Minkowski content]] of the surface.\n\n== Common formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Surface areas of common solids\n|-\n!Shape\n!Equation\n!Variables\n|-\n|[[Cube]]\n|<math> 6s^2 \\, </math>\n|''s'' = side length\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]\n|<math> 2(\\ell w + \\ell h + wh) \\, </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Triangular prism]]\n|<math> bh + l(a + b + c) </math>\n|''b'' = base length of triangle, ''h'' = height of triangle, ''l'' = distance between triangular bases, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' = sides of triangle\n|-\n|All [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]]\n|<math> 2B + Ph \\, </math>\n|''B'' = the area of one base, ''P'' = the perimeter of one base, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Sphere]]\n|<math> 4\\pi r^2 = \\pi d^2\\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''d'' = diameter\n|-\n|[[Spherical lune]]\n|<math> 2r^2\\theta \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''\u03b8'' = [[dihedral angle]]\n|-\n|[[Torus]]\n|<math> (2\\pi r)(2\\pi R) = 4\\pi^2 Rr</math>\n|''r'' = minor radius (radius of the tube), ''R'' = major radius (distance from center of tube to center of torus)\n|-\n|Closed [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n|<math> 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh = 2\\pi r(r+h) \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of the circular base, ''h'' = height of the cylinder\n|-\n|Lateral surface area of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi rs \\, </math>\n|<math> s = \\sqrt{r^2+h^2} </math><br/>\n''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|Full surface area of a cone\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(r + \\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi r(r + s) \\, </math>\n| ''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|[[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]]\n|<math>B + \\frac{PL}{2}</math>\n|''B'' = area of base, ''P'' = perimeter of base, ''L'' = slant height\n|-\n|[[Square pyramid]]\n|<math> b^2 + 2bs = b^2 + 2b\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''b'' = base length, ''s'' = slant height, ''h'' = vertical height\n|-\n|Rectangular pyramid\n|<math> lw + l\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} + w\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Tetrahedron]]\n|<math> \\sqrt{3}a^2 </math>\n|''a'' = side length\n|}\n\n===Ratio of surface areas of a sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height===\n[[Image:Inscribed cone sphere cylinder.svg|thumb|300px|A cone, sphere and cylinder of radius ''r'' and height ''h''.]]\nThe below given formulas can be used to show that the surface area of a [[sphere]] and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same radius and height are in the ratio '''2&nbsp;:&nbsp;3''', as follows.\n\nLet the radius be ''r'' and the height be ''h'' (which is 2''r'' for the sphere).\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{rlll}\n\\text{Sphere surface area}   & = 4 \\pi r^2      &                    & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 2 \\\\\n\\text{Cylinder surface area} & = 2 \\pi r (h + r) & = 2 \\pi r (2r + r) & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 3\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe discovery of this ratio is credited to [[Archimedes]].<ref>{{cite web|first = Chris|last = Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|access-date = 2007-01-02|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209201723/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|archive-date = 2006-12-09|df = }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In chemistry ==\n[[File:Surface area.svg|thumb|Surface area of particles of different sizes.]]\n{{see also|Accessible surface area}}\nSurface area is important in [[chemical kinetics]]. Increasing the surface area of a substance generally increases the [[reaction rate|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]].  For example, [[iron]] in a fine powder will [[combustion|combust]], while in solid blocks it is stable enough to use in structures. For different applications a minimal or maximal surface area may be desired.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In biology ==\n{{see also|Surface-area-to-volume ratio}}\n[[Image:Mitochondrion 186.jpg|right|thumb|The inner membrane of the [[mitochondrion]] has a large surface area due to infoldings, allowing higher rates of [[cellular respiration]] (electron [[micrograph]]).]]\nThe surface area of an organism is important in several considerations, such as regulation of body temperature and [[digestion]]. Animals use their [[teeth]] to grind food down into smaller particles, increasing the surface area available for digestion. The epithelial tissue lining the digestive tract contains [[microvilli]], greatly increasing the area available for absorption. [[Elephant]]s have large [[ear]]s, allowing them to regulate their own body temperature. In other instances, animals will need to minimize surface area; for example, people will fold their arms over their chest when cold to minimize heat loss.\n\nThe [[surface area to volume ratio]] (SA:V) of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the [[cell membrane]] to interstitial spaces or to other cells. Indeed, representing a cell as an idealized [[sphere]] of radius ''r'', the volume and surface area are, respectively, ''V'' = 4/3 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>3</sup>; ''SA'' = 4 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>2</sup>. The resulting surface area to volume ratio is therefore 3/''r''. Thus, if a cell has a radius of 1 \u03bcm, the SA:V ratio is 3; whereas if the radius of the cell is instead 10 \u03bcm, then the SA:V ratio becomes 0.3. With a cell radius of 100, SA:V ratio is 0.03. Thus, the surface area falls off steeply with increasing volume.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perimeter length]]\n* [[BET theory]], technique for the measurement of the specific surface area of materials\n* [[Spherical area]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n* {{eom|title=Area|id=A/a013180|author=Yu.D.

Only the [[five-star rank]] of [[Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force]] is higher, but it has only been held in a ceremonial capacity. As there are currently no appointments in the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) at the five-star level, there is no prospect of a RAAF officer achieving the rank in a professional (i.e. non-ceremonial) capacity. Additionally, Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force is generally considered to be a marshal rank as opposed to an air marshal rank and so the only two individuals ever to hold the rank, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], are not listed in a separate section. With the current structure of the ADF, the rank of air chief marshal is only held when an officer of the RAAF is appointed as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]]. As of June 2018, only four officers have obtained the rank of air chief marshal in the RAAF, the first being [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] in 1965 who was also the first non-Army officer in the Australian military to reach [[four-star rank]]. [[Mark Binskin]] is the recently promoted of the four, having been advanced to air chief marshal in June 2014.<ref name=\"ACMs\">{{Cite news|first=Chris|last=Clark|title=Air Force Defence chiefs of the past|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|publisher=Air Force News|date=19 May 2005|accessdate=14 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608112946/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|archivedate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rayner|1992|pp=298\u2013299}}</ref>\n\nAir chief marshals of the Royal Australian Air Force are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Chief Marshals |accessdate=14 July 2010 |work=Air Marshals of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force Air Power Development Centre |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525185205/http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Senior command(s) and notes\n|-\n| |{{sortname|Mark|Binskin}} || 1960 || {{center|\u2014}}  || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (2014\u201318), [[Vice Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Vice Chief of the Defence Force]] (2011\u201314), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2008\u201311), [[RAAF Air Command|Air Commander Australia]] (2007\u201308)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Angus|Houston|Angus Houston}} || 1947 || {{center|\u2014}} || Chief of the Defence Force (2005\u201311), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2001\u201305)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Neville|McNamara|Neville McNamara}} || 1923 || 2014 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force Staff]] (1982\u201384), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (1979\u201382), Commander, RAAF Forces Vietnam (1971\u201372)\n|-\n| {{nowrap|{{sortname|Sir Frederick|Scherger|Frederick Scherger}}}} || 1904 || 1984 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]] (1961\u201366), Chief of the Air Staff (1957\u201361)\n|}\n\n==Air marshals==\n[[File:RAAF O9.jpg|thumb|alt=A black shoulder board with the word \"AUSTRALIA\" across the bottom.

Only the [[five-star rank]] of [[Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force]] is higher, but it has only been held in a ceremonial capacity. As there are currently no appointments in the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) at the five-star level, there is no prospect of a RAAF officer achieving the rank in a professional (i.e. non-ceremonial) capacity. Additionally, Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force is generally considered to be a marshal rank as opposed to an air marshal rank and so the only two individuals ever to hold the rank, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], are not listed in a separate section. With the current structure of the ADF, the rank of air chief marshal is only held when an officer of the RAAF is appointed as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]]. As of June 2018, only four officers have obtained the rank of air chief marshal in the RAAF, the first being [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] in 1965 who was also the first non-Army officer in the Australian military to reach [[four-star rank]]. [[Mark Binskin]] is the recently promoted of the four, having been advanced to air chief marshal in June 2014.<ref name=\"ACMs\">{{Cite news|first=Chris|last=Clark|title=Air Force Defence chiefs of the past|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|publisher=Air Force News|date=19 May 2005|accessdate=14 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608112946/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|archivedate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rayner|1992|pp=298\u2013299}}</ref>\n\nAir chief marshals of the Royal Australian Air Force are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Chief Marshals |accessdate=14 July 2010 |work=Air Marshals of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force Air Power Development Centre |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525185205/http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Senior command(s) and notes\n|-\n| |{{sortname|Mark|Binskin}} || 1960 || {{center|\u2014}}  || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (2014\u201318), [[Vice Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Vice Chief of the Defence Force]] (2011\u201314), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2008\u201311), [[RAAF Air Command|Air Commander Australia]] (2007\u201308)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Angus|Houston|Angus Houston}} || 1947 || {{center|\u2014}} || Chief of the Defence Force (2005\u201311), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2001\u201305)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Neville|McNamara|Neville McNamara}} || 1923 || 2014 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force Staff]] (1982\u201384), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (1979\u201382), Commander, RAAF Forces Vietnam (1971\u201372)\n|-\n| {{nowrap|{{sortname|Sir Frederick|Scherger|Frederick Scherger}}}} || 1904 || 1984 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]] (1961\u201366), Chief of the Air Staff (1957\u201361)\n|}\n\n==Air marshals==\n[[File:RAAF O9.jpg|thumb|alt=A black shoulder board with the word \"AUSTRALIA\" across the bottom.

None of the Dairanger costumes were used in ''[[Power Rangers]]'', except Kiba Ranger's, which was adapted into the White Ranger's costume for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' for the remainder of Season 2 and throughout Season 3: the suits from the previous season, ''[[Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger]]'' were instead used for the other Rangers in that show (The end credits listed the show as titled ''Dai Rangers'').

The civilization consisted of three separate tribes: the Dai, the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Shura]] (the ancestors of today's humanity) and the Gorma (the military tribe); which lived in harmony. However, one day, the Gorma Tribe decided to take over the Daos civilization and the world, beginning the war between the Gorma and Dai tribes. The war between the Gorma, led by the Gorma Triumvarate, and the Dai continued for 5,000 years until the Mythical Qi Beasts appeared to oppose the Gorma, whose [[Qi]]{{r|group=Note|Qi}} powers had increased to the point that they could turn themselves into monsters. Five Dai warriors' Qi powers had increased to the point where they could control the Mythical Qi Beasts. The war ended with the disappearance of both the Dai and Gorma tribes and the Shura scattered around the world. In the present day, the Gorma Tribe, one of the Daos' two missing branches, arose to take over the world. To counter them, Master Kaku assembled a team of five youths with high levels of Qi, who became the Dairangers.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Dairangers===\n[[Image:Dairanger.jpg|thumb|The core five Dairangers: (from left to right) [[#Kazu|Qilin Ranger]], [[#Rin|Houou Ranger]], [[#Ryo|Ryu Ranger]], [[#Shoji|Tenma Ranger]], and [[#Daigo|Shishi Ranger]].]]\nThe descendants of the Dai Tribe who battle the Gorma.\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Dairangers#Ryo|Ryo of the Heavenly Fire Star/Ryu Ranger]]|\u5929\u706b\u661f\u30fb\u4eae/\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|Tenkasei Ry\u014d/Ry\u016b Renj\u0101}}: The son of [[Zhang Liao]] who became a Dairanger against his will.\n;{{Nihongo|[[Dairangers#Daigo|Daigo of the Heavenly Illusion Star/Shishi Ranger]]|\u5929\u5e7b\u661f\u30fb\u5927\u4e94/\u30b7\u30b7\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|Tengensei Daigo/Shishi Renj\u0101}}: The gentle member of the team and the most skilled fighter after Ryo.

A somewhat perverted boy, he often grabs Rin's breasts and looks up her skirt at times, and wishes to marry her. New to fighting, he is not particularly strong. While Kou is of Dai blood, he is also part Gorma on his father's side.\n\n===The Gorma Tribe===\n{{empty section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Daijinryuu===\n{{Nihongo|Daijinryuu|\u5927\u795e\u9f8d|Daijinry\u016b, Great God Dragon|37, 38, 42-44, 49 & 50}} is a colossal god-like entity who preserves the natural balance of the world, referred to as the \"Great King of Fear that will destroy the Earth\" by Kameo/Daimugen. He appears whenever battles have gone too far, like the ones between the Dairangers and the Gorma. Daijinryuu is a neutral being, but has no tolerance for whoever threatens to disrupt the natural order of things. Daijinryuu arrived on the planet in {{Nihongo|Rising Dragon Mode|\u6607\u7adc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Sh\u014dry\u016b M\u014ddo}}, only to transform into the bipedal {{Nihongo|Dragon God Mode|\u7adc\u795e\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Ry\u016bjin M\u014ddo}}, his feet as big as Daimugen's shell.\n\nHe is also capable of firing lightning bolts with immense destructive power. During his first appearance, he attacks the Great Famous Pachinko Player and Ryuuseioh. The universe's will that he obeyed told him that the two warring factions had to agree a [[cease-fire]], so Daijinryuu would spare the lives of everyone on Earth and the planet itself, but he gave a warning to both the Dairangers and the Gorma not to incur his wrath by destroying most of [[Tokyo]].\n\nThe annoyed dragon crushed the monster to death under his massive foot, then turned and disassembled Dairen'oh with a lightning bolt. He then attempted to crush Ryuuseioh (the only Mythical Chi Beast left standing). Ryuuseioh was saved by Daimugen, who hid Ryuuseioh inside of his shell, but was nearly crushed by Daijinryuu. Daijinryuu let them live because of the universe's will and the truce between the Dairangers and the Gorma.\n\nWhen the Dairangers dealt with Ikazuchi, Daijinryuu seemingly put many civilians in Tokyo under his control, lining them up on top of buildings to fall to their deaths, before Jiaxu counter-acted the spell. Daijinryuu made his final appearance to destroy the Gorma Palace, seeing that Shadam and the Gorma were the cause of all the trouble. To calm him down, the Lailai Balls and the Great Earth Shaking Jewel scattered to the four winds on their own will.\n\n==Episodes==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid Red;\"\n! style=\"width:1%;\"  | No.\n!

Directed by Sh\u014dhei T\u014dj\u014d and written by [[Noboru Sugimura]], the movie was originally shown as a triple feature alongside ''[[Kamen Rider ZO]]'' and the film version of ''[[Tokusou Robo Janperson]]''. The main villain of the film is an original monster, named the {{Nihongo|Duke of Trump|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u516c\u7235|Toranpu K\u014dshaku}}, who gathers four of the Dairangers' previous adversaries to defeat them. While the movie was filmed between episodes 5\u20138, its story actually takes place between episodes 8 and 9 due to the appearance of Dairen-\u014d. Shohei Shibata, the young actor who played Hiroshi in ''Kamen Rider ZO'' later joined the cast of ''Dairanger'' as Akomaru, son of the main villain Shadam.\n\n==Cast==\n* {{nihongo|Ryo of the Heavenly Fire Star|\u5929\u706b\u661f\u30fb\u4eae|Tenkasei Ry\u014d}}: {{Nihongo|Keiichi Wada|\u548c\u7530 \u572d\u5e02|Wada Keiichi}}\n* {{nihongo|Daigo of the Heavenly Illusion Star|\u5929\u5e7b\u661f\u30fb\u5927\u4e94|Tengensei Daigo}}: {{Nihongo|Tatsuya N\u014dmi|\u80fd\u898b \u9054\u4e5f|N\u014dmi Tatsuya}}\n* {{nihongo|Shoji of the Heavenly Gravity Star|\u5929\u91cd\u661f\u30fb\u5c06\u5150|Tenj\u016bsei Sh\u014dji}}: {{Nihongo|Ei Hamura|\u7fbd\u6751 \u82f1|Hamura Ei}}\n* {{nihongo|Kazu of the Heavenly Time Star|\u5929\u6642\u661f\u30fb\u77e5|Tenjisei Kazu}}: {{Nihongo|Keisuke Tsuchiya|\u571f\u5c4b \u572d\u8f14|Tsuchiya Keisuke}}\n* {{nihongo|Rin of the Heavenly Wind Star|\u5929\u98a8\u661f\u30fb\u30ea\u30f3|Tenp\u016bsei Rin}}: {{Nihongo|Natsuki Takahashi|\u9ad8\u6a4b \u590f\u6a39|Takahashi Natsuki}}\n* {{nihongo|Kou of the Howling New Star|\u543c\u65b0\u661f\u30fb\u30b3\u30a6|Koshinsei K\u014d}}: {{Nihongo|Hisashi Sakai|\u9152\u4e95 \u5bff|Sakai Hisashi}}\n* {{nihongo|Master Kaku|\u9053\u58eb\u5609\u6327|D\u014dshi Kaku}}: {{Nihongo|Koji Naka|\u4e2d\u5eb7\u6cbb|Naka Koji}}\n* {{nihongo|Grandmaster Yufang|\u8001\u9053\u58eb\u865e\u7ffb|R\u014dd\u014dshi Guhon}}: {{Nihongo|Takeshi Kuwabara|\u6851\u539f \u6bc5|Kuwabara Takeshi}}\n* {{nihongo|Kujaku|\u30af\u30b8\u30e3\u30af|Kujaku}}: {{Nihongo|Masako Morishita|\u68ee\u4e0b \u96c5\u5b50|Morishita Masako}}\n* {{nihongo|Kou's Mother|\u30b3\u30a6\u306e\u6bcd|K\u014d no Haha}}: {{Nihongo|[[Mikiko Miki]]|\u4e09\u8f1d \u307f\u304d\u3053|Miki Mikiko}}\n* Kameo: {{Nihongo|Sugisaku Imagawa|\u4eca\u5ddd \u6749\u4f5c|Imagawa Sugisaku}}\n* {{nihongo|Gorma XV|\u30b4\u30fc\u30de\u5341\u4e94\u4e16|G\u014dma J\u016bg\u014dsei}}: {{Nihongo|Munemaru K\u014dda|\u5e78\u7530 \u5b97\u4e38|K\u014dda Munemaru}}\n* {{nihongo|Commander Gara|\u30ac\u30e9\u4e2d\u4f50|Gara Ch\u016bsa}}: {{Nihongo|Akiko Amamatsuri|\u5929\u796d \u63da\u5b50|Amamatsuri Akiko}}\n* {{nihongo|Lieutenant Commander Zydos|\u30b6\u30a4\u30c9\u30b9\u5c11\u4f50|Zaidosu Sh\u014dsa}}: {{Nihongo|Maroshi Tamura|\u7530\u6751 \u5186|Tamura Maroshi}}\n* {{nihongo|Commander Shadam|\u30b7\u30e3\u30c0\u30e0\u4e2d\u4f50|Shadamu Ch\u016bsa}}: {{Nihongo|[[Rintar\u014d Nishi]]|\u897f \u51dc\u592a\u6717|Nishi Rintar\u014d}}\n* {{nihongo|General Tenpou|\u7530\u8c4a\u5c06\u8ecd|Tenp\u014d Sh\u014dgun}}: {{Nihongo|Ch\u016bk\u014d Ueda|\u4e0a\u7530 \u5fe0\u597d|Ueda Ch\u016bk\u014d}}\n* {{nihongo|Akomaru|\u963f\u53e4\u4e38|Akomaru}}: {{Nihongo|Shohei Shibata|\u67f4\u7530 \u7fd4\u5e73|Shibata Shohei}}\n* Jin Matoba: {{Nihongo|[[Yutaka Hirose]]|\u5e83\u702c \u88d5|Hirose Yutaka|credited as Takumi Hirose}}\n\n===Voice actors===\n* Narrator: {{Nihongo|[[Hironori Miyata]]|\u5bae\u7530 \u6d69\u5fb3|Miyata Hironori}}\n* {{nihongo|Byakkoshinken|\u767d\u864e\u771f\u5263|Byakkoshinken}}: Wataru Abe\n* Daimugen: {{Nihongo|Ikko Tadano|\u305f\u3060\u306e \u3044\u3063\u3053|Tadano Ikko}} credited as {{Nihongo|Tomihisa Naruse|\u6210\u702c \u5bcc\u4e45|Naruse Tomihisa}}\n* {{nihongo|General Kamikaze|\u795e\u98a8\u5927\u5c06|Kamikaze Taish\u014d}}: {{Nihongo|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|\u6a9c\u5c71 \u4fee\u4e4b|Hiyama Nobuyuki}}\n* {{nihongo|Master Phone|\u96fb\u8a71\u5148\u751f|Denwa Sensei}}: {{Nihongo|Akiko Muta|\u3080\u305f \u3042\u304d\u3053}}\n* {{nihongo|Chief Tombstone|\u5893\u77f3\u793e\u9577|Hakaishi Shach\u014d}}: {{Nihongo|Takuzou Kamiyama|\u795e\u5c71 \u5353\u4e09}}\n* {{nihongo|Kabuki Novice|\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e\u5c0f\u50e7|Kabuki Koz\u014d}}: {{Nihongo|[[Shigeru Chiba]]|\u5343\u8449 \u7e41|Chiba Shigeru|13 & 14}}\n\n===Guest actors===\n* Kazu's clone: {{Nihongo|Daisuke Tsuchiya|\u571f\u5c4b \u5927\u8f14|Tsuchiya Daisuke|25}}\n* Sh\u014dichir\u014d Takamura (human form of Media Magician): {{Nihongo|Ryosuke Kaizu|\u6d77\u6d25 \u4eae\u4ecb|Kaizu Ry\u014dsuke|33}}\n\n==Songs==\n;Opening theme\n* {{Nihongo|\"Gosei Sentai Dairanger\"|\u4e94\u661f\u6226\u968a\u30c0\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|Gosei Sentai Dairenj\u0101}}\n** Lyrics: [[Saburo Yatsude]]\n** Composition: Katsuo Ohno\n** Arrangement: [[Kenji Yamamoto (composer born 1958)|Kenji Yamamoto]]\n** Artist: New JACK Takur\u014d\n\n;Ending theme\n* {{Nihongo|\"Oretachi Muteki Sa!!

Factory]] announced that they would release \"''Gosei Sentai Dairanger'': The Complete Series\" on DVD in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herotaku.com/blog/2015/07/11/27920/sdcc-2015-shout-factory-announces-gosei-sentai-dairanger-dvd-release/#.VaCbdkmBWak.facebook|title=SDCC 2015: Shout Factory Announces Gosei Sentai Dairanger DVD Release|last=Amand|first=Ginji|work=Herotaku.com|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711193208/http://herotaku.com/blog/2015/07/11/27920/sdcc-2015-shout-factory-announces-gosei-sentai-dairanger-dvd-release/#.VaCbdkmBWak.facebook|archivedate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=November 2017}} On November 10, 2015, ''Dairanger'' was released on DVD in North America.

The civilization consisted of three separate tribes: the Dai, the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Shura]] (the ancestors of today's humanity) and the Gorma (the military tribe); which lived in harmony. However, one day, the Gorma Tribe decided to take over the Daos civilization and the world, beginning the war between the Gorma and Dai tribes. The war between the Gorma, led by the Gorma Triumvarate, and the Dai continued for 5,000 years until the Mythical Qi Beasts appeared to oppose the Gorma, whose [[Qi]]{{r|group=Note|Qi}} powers had increased to the point that they could turn themselves into monsters. Five Dai warriors' Qi powers had increased to the point where they could control the Mythical Qi Beasts. The war ended with the disappearance of both the Dai and Gorma tribes and the Shura scattered around the world. In the present day, the Gorma Tribe, one of the Daos' two missing branches, arose to take over the world. To counter them, Master Kaku assembled a team of five youths with high levels of Qi, who became the Dairangers.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Dairangers===\n[[Image:Dairanger.jpg|thumb|The core five Dairangers: (from left to right) [[#Kazu|Qilin Ranger]], [[#Rin|Houou Ranger]], [[#Ryo|Ryu Ranger]], [[#Shoji|Tenma Ranger]], and [[#Daigo|Shishi Ranger]].]]\nThe descendants of the Dai Tribe who battle the Gorma.\n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Dairangers#Ryo|Ryo of the Heavenly Fire Star/Ryu Ranger]]|\u5929\u706b\u661f\u30fb\u4eae/\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|Tenkasei Ry\u014d/Ry\u016b Renj\u0101}}: The son of [[Zhang Liao]] who became a Dairanger against his will.\n;{{Nihongo|[[Dairangers#Daigo|Daigo of the Heavenly Illusion Star/Shishi Ranger]]|\u5929\u5e7b\u661f\u30fb\u5927\u4e94/\u30b7\u30b7\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc|Tengensei Daigo/Shishi Renj\u0101}}: The gentle member of the team and the most skilled fighter after Ryo.

A somewhat perverted boy, he often grabs Rin's breasts and looks up her skirt at times, and wishes to marry her. New to fighting, he is not particularly strong. While Kou is of Dai blood, he is also part Gorma on his father's side.\n\n===The Gorma Tribe===\n{{empty section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Daijinryuu===\n{{Nihongo|Daijinryuu|\u5927\u795e\u9f8d|Daijinry\u016b, Great God Dragon|37, 38, 42-44, 49 & 50}} is a colossal god-like entity who preserves the natural balance of the world, referred to as the \"Great King of Fear that will destroy the Earth\" by Kameo/Daimugen. He appears whenever battles have gone too far, like the ones between the Dairangers and the Gorma. Daijinryuu is a neutral being, but has no tolerance for whoever threatens to disrupt the natural order of things. Daijinryuu arrived on the planet in {{Nihongo|Rising Dragon Mode|\u6607\u7adc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Sh\u014dry\u016b M\u014ddo}}, only to transform into the bipedal {{Nihongo|Dragon God Mode|\u7adc\u795e\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Ry\u016bjin M\u014ddo}}, his feet as big as Daimugen's shell.\n\nHe is also capable of firing lightning bolts with immense destructive power. During his first appearance, he attacks the Great Famous Pachinko Player and Ryuuseioh. The universe's will that he obeyed told him that the two warring factions had to agree a [[cease-fire]], so Daijinryuu would spare the lives of everyone on Earth and the planet itself, but he gave a warning to both the Dairangers and the Gorma not to incur his wrath by destroying most of [[Tokyo]].\n\nThe annoyed dragon crushed the monster to death under his massive foot, then turned and disassembled Dairen'oh with a lightning bolt. He then attempted to crush Ryuuseioh (the only Mythical Chi Beast left standing). Ryuuseioh was saved by Daimugen, who hid Ryuuseioh inside of his shell, but was nearly crushed by Daijinryuu. Daijinryuu let them live because of the universe's will and the truce between the Dairangers and the Gorma.\n\nWhen the Dairangers dealt with Ikazuchi, Daijinryuu seemingly put many civilians in Tokyo under his control, lining them up on top of buildings to fall to their deaths, before Jiaxu counter-acted the spell. Daijinryuu made his final appearance to destroy the Gorma Palace, seeing that Shadam and the Gorma were the cause of all the trouble. To calm him down, the Lailai Balls and the Great Earth Shaking Jewel scattered to the four winds on their own will.\n\n==Episodes==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid Red;\"\n! style=\"width:1%;\"  | No.\n!

Directed by Sh\u014dhei T\u014dj\u014d and written by [[Noboru Sugimura]], the movie was originally shown as a triple feature alongside ''[[Kamen Rider ZO]]'' and the film version of ''[[Tokusou Robo Janperson]]''.

They spend much of their time soaring. They will take live vertebrate prey, but mostly feed on [[insect]]s or even carrion.\n* The [[Accipitrinae|true hawk]]s are medium-sized birds of prey that usually belong to the genus ''[[Accipiter]]'' (see below). They are mainly woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch. They usually have long tails for tight steering.\n* [[Buzzards]] are medium-large raptors with robust bodies and broad wings, or, alternatively, any bird of the genus ''[[Buteo]]'' (also commonly known as \"hawks\" in North America, while \"buzzard\" is colloquially used for vultures).\n* [[Harrier (bird)|Harriers]] are large, slender hawk-like birds with long tails and long thin legs. Most use a combination of keen eyesight and hearing to hunt small vertebrates, gliding on their long broad wings and circling low over [[grassland]]s and [[marsh]]es.\n* [[Vulture]]s are carrion-eating raptors of two distinct biological families: the ''[[Accipitridae]]'', which occurs only in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]; and the ''[[Cathartidae]]'', which occurs only in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Members of both groups have heads either partly or fully devoid of feathers.\n* [[Falcon]]s are medium-size birds of prey with long pointed wings. They belong to the ''[[Falconidae]]'' family, rather than the ''[[Accipitridae]]'' (accipiters). Many are particularly swift flyers.\n* [[Caracara (subfamily)|Caracara]]s are a distinct subgroup of the ''Falconidae'' unique to the [[New World]], and most common in the [[Neotropics]] \u2013 their broad wings, naked faces and appetites of a generalist suggest some level of convergence with either the ''Buteo''s or the [[Vulturine Parrot|vulturine]] birds, or both.\n* [[Owls]] are variable-sized, typically night-specialized hunting birds. They fly almost silently due to their special feather structure that reduces turbulence. They have particularly acute hearing.\n\nMany of these [[English language]] group names originally referred to particular species encountered in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. As English-speaking people travelled further, the familiar names were applied to new birds with similar characteristics. Names that have generalised this way include: kite (''[[red kite|Milvus milvus]]''), sparrow-hawk or sparhawk (''[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Accipiter nisus]]''), goshawk (''[[northern goshawk|Accipiter gentilis]]''), kestrel (''[[common kestrel|Falco tinninculus]]''), hobby  (''[[Eurasian hobby|Falco subbuteo]]''), harrier (simplified from \"hen-harrier\", ''[[hen harrier|Circus cyaneus]]''), buzzard (''[[common buzzard|Buteo buteo]]'').\n\nSome names have not generalised, and refer to single species (or groups of closely related (sub)species): [[merlin (bird)|merlin]] (''Falco columbarius''), [[osprey]] (''Pandion haliaetus'').\n\n==Systematics==\n===Historical classifications===\nThe taxonomy of [[Carl Linnaeus]] grouped birds (class Aves) into orders, genera, and species, with no formal ranks between genus and order. He placed all birds of prey into a single order, ''Accipitres'', subdividing this into four genera: ''[[Vulture|Vultur]]'' (vultures), ''[[Falco (bird)|Falco]]'' (eagles, hawks, falcons, etc.), ''[[Strix (genus)|Strix]]'' (owls), and ''[[Lanius]]'' (shrikes). This approach was followed by subsequent authors such as Gmelin, Latham, and Turnton.\n\n[[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot|Louis Pierre Veillot]] used additional ranks: order, tribe, family, genus, species. Birds of prey (order Accipitres) were divided into diurnal and nocturnal tribes; the owls remained monogeneric (family \u00c6golii, genus ''Strix''), whilst the diurnal raptors were divided into three families: Vulturini, Gypa\u00ebti, and Accipitrini.<ref name=Veillot1816>{{cite book|last1=Veillot|first1=Louis Pierre|editor1-last=Saunders|editor1-first=Howard|title=Analyse d'une nouvelle ornithologie \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire.|year=1816|edition=London 1883|language=French|publisher=Willughby Society|url=https://archive.org/details/vieillotsanalyse00viei}}</ref>\n\nThus Veillot's families were similar to the Linnaean genera, with the difference that shrikes were no longer included amongst the birds of prey. In addition to the original ''Vultur'' and ''Falco'' (now reduced in scope), Veillot adopted four genera from Savigny: ''Phene'', ''Hali\u00e6etus'', ''Pandion'', and ''Elanus''. He also introduced five new genera of vultures (''Gypagus'', ''Catharista'', ''Daptrius'', ''Ibycter'', ''Polyborus''){{NoteTag|Veillot included the caracaras (''Daptrius'', ''Ibycter'', and ''Polyborus'') in Vulturini, though it is now known that they are related to falcons.}} and eleven new genera of accipitrines (''Aquila'', ''Circa\u00ebtus'', ''Circus'', ''Buteo'', ''Milvus'', ''Ictinia'', ''Physeta'', ''Harpia'', ''Spiza\u00ebtus'', ''Asturina'', ''Sparvius'').\n\n===Modern systematics===\n[[File:bald.eagle.closeup.arp-sh.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Bald eagle]]]]\n\nThe order Accipitriformes is believed to have originated 44 million years ago when it split from the common ancestor of the [[secretarybird]] (''Sagittarius serpentarius'') and the accipitrid species.<ref name=phy>{{cite journal|last1=Nagy|first1=J.|last2=T\u00f6k\u00f6lyi|first2=J.|title=Phylogeny, historical biogeography and the evolution of migration in accipitrid birds of prey (Aves: Accipitriformes)|journal=Ornis Hungarica|year=2014|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15\u201335|doi=10.2478/orhu-2014-0008|url=http://ornis.hu/articles/OrnisHungarica_vol22%281%29_p15-35.pdf}}</ref> The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel.

Based on some comparative analyses, diet breadth also has an effect on the evolution of migratory behaviour in this group,<ref name=\"phy\"/> but its relevance needs further investigation. The evolution of migration in animals seems to be a complex and difficult topic with many unanswered questions.\n\nA recent study discovered new connections between migration and the ecology, life history of raptors. A brief overview from abstract of the published paper shows that \"clutch size and hunting strategies have been proved to be the most important variables in shaping distribution areas, and also the geographic dissimilarities may mask important relationships between life history traits and migratory behaviours. The West Palearctic-Afrotropical and the North-South American migratory systems are fundamentally different from the East Palearctic-Indomalayan system, owing to the presence versus absence of ecological barriers.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Nagy|first=Jen\u0151|last2=V\u00e9gv\u00e1ri|first2=Zsolt|last3=Varga|first3=Zolt\u00e1n|year=2016|title=Life history traits, bioclimate, and migratory systems of accipitrid birds of prey (Aves: Accipitriformes)|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=121|pages=63\u201371|doi=10.1093/biolinnean/blw021|doi-access=free}}</ref> Maximum entropy modelling can help in answering the question: why species winters at one location while the others are elsewhere. Temperature and precipitation related factors differ in the limitation of species distributions. \"This suggests that the migratory behaviours differ among the three main migratory routes for these species\"<ref name=\":0\" /> which may have important conservational consequences in the protection of migratory raptors.\n\n==Sexual dimorphism==\n[[File:Falco vespertinus 3 (Martin Mecnarowski).jpg|thumb|left|Male (left) and female (right) [[Red-footed falcon|red-footed falcons]]]]\n[[File:Shikra 3.jpg|thumb|Shikra females have yellow eyes]]\nRaptors are known to display patterns of [[sexual dimorphism]]. It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause for sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimonious]], meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the [[sexual selection]]  model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=H.C.|title=The Evolution of Reversed Sexual Dimorphism in Owls: An Empirical Analysis of Possible Selective Factors|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=98|issue=3|pages=387\u2013406}}</ref>\n\nDimorphisms can also be the product of [[intrasexual selection]] between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males competing with other males for adequate hunting ground so they appear as the most healthy mate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wiehn|first1=J.|last2=Korpimakki|first2=E.|last3=Massemin|first3=S.|title=Reversed sexual size dimorphism in raptors: evaluation of the hypotheses in kestrels breeding in a temporally changing environment|journal=Oecologia|year=2000|volume=124|issue=1|pages=26\u201332|doi=10.1007/s004420050021|pmid=28308409|bibcode=2000Oecol.124...26M}}</ref>\nIt has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of [[disruptive selection]], and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. Sexual dimorphism can be viewed as something that can accelerate the rate of speciation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=BOLNICK|first1=David|last2=DOEBEL|first2=Michael|title=SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND ADAPTIVE SPECIATION: TWO SIDES OF THE SAME ECOLOGICAL COIN|journal=The Society of Evolution|date=November 2003|volume=57|issue=11}}</ref>\n\nIn non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case. For instance, the [[kestrel]] is a type of falcon in which males are the primary providers, and the females are responsible for nurturing the young. In this species, the smaller the kestrels are, the less food is needed and thus, they can survive in environments that are harsher. This is particularly true in the male kestrels. It has become more energetically favorable for male kestrels to remain smaller than their female counterparts because smaller males have an agility advantage when it comes to defending the nest and hunting. Larger females are favored because they can incubate larger numbers of offspring, while also being able to breed a larger clutch size.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sonerud|first1=G|last2=Steen|first2=R|last3=Low|first3=L|last4=Roed|first4=L.|last5=Skar|first5=K.|last6=Selas|first6=V|last7=Slagsvold|first7=T|title=Size-biased allocation of prey from male to offspring via female: family conflicts, prey selection, and evolution of sexual size dimorphism in raptors|journal=Oceologa|date=2013|volume=172|issue=1|pages=93\u2013107|doi=10.1007/s00442-012-2491-9|pmid=23073637|bibcode=2013Oecol.172...93S}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Birds}}\n* [[Origin of birds]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |title=British birds of prey : a study of Britain's 24 diurnal raptors |last=Brown |first=Leslie |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2013 |isbn=9780007406487 |location=Hammersmith, London }}\n*{{cite book |title=Birds of Prey Hawks, Eagles, Falcons, and Vultures of North America |last1=Dunne |first1=Pete |last2=Karlson |first2=Kevin |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2017 |isbn=9780544018440 |oclc=953709935 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Raptor : a journey through birds |last=Macdonald Lockhart |first=James |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=2017 |isbn=9780226470580  |location=Chicago |oclc=959200538 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Birds of prey |last=Mackenzie |first=John P.

They spend much of their time soaring. They will take live vertebrate prey, but mostly feed on [[insect]]s or even carrion.\n* The [[Accipitrinae|true hawk]]s are medium-sized birds of prey that usually belong to the genus ''[[Accipiter]]'' (see below). They are mainly woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch. They usually have long tails for tight steering.\n* [[Buzzards]] are medium-large raptors with robust bodies and broad wings, or, alternatively, any bird of the genus ''[[Buteo]]'' (also commonly known as \"hawks\" in North America, while \"buzzard\" is colloquially used for vultures).\n* [[Harrier (bird)|Harriers]] are large, slender hawk-like birds with long tails and long thin legs. Most use a combination of keen eyesight and hearing to hunt small vertebrates, gliding on their long broad wings and circling low over [[grassland]]s and [[marsh]]es.\n* [[Vulture]]s are carrion-eating raptors of two distinct biological families: the ''[[Accipitridae]]'', which occurs only in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]; and the ''[[Cathartidae]]'', which occurs only in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Members of both groups have heads either partly or fully devoid of feathers.\n* [[Falcon]]s are medium-size birds of prey with long pointed wings. They belong to the ''[[Falconidae]]'' family, rather than the ''[[Accipitridae]]'' (accipiters). Many are particularly swift flyers.\n* [[Caracara (subfamily)|Caracara]]s are a distinct subgroup of the ''Falconidae'' unique to the [[New World]], and most common in the [[Neotropics]] \u2013 their broad wings, naked faces and appetites of a generalist suggest some level of convergence with either the ''Buteo''s or the [[Vulturine Parrot|vulturine]] birds, or both.\n* [[Owls]] are variable-sized, typically night-specialized hunting birds. They fly almost silently due to their special feather structure that reduces turbulence. They have particularly acute hearing.\n\nMany of these [[English language]] group names originally referred to particular species encountered in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. As English-speaking people travelled further, the familiar names were applied to new birds with similar characteristics. Names that have generalised this way include: kite (''[[red kite|Milvus milvus]]''), sparrow-hawk or sparhawk (''[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Accipiter nisus]]''), goshawk (''[[northern goshawk|Accipiter gentilis]]''), kestrel (''[[common kestrel|Falco tinninculus]]''), hobby  (''[[Eurasian hobby|Falco subbuteo]]''), harrier (simplified from \"hen-harrier\", ''[[hen harrier|Circus cyaneus]]''), buzzard (''[[common buzzard|Buteo buteo]]'').\n\nSome names have not generalised, and refer to single species (or groups of closely related (sub)species): [[merlin (bird)|merlin]] (''Falco columbarius''), [[osprey]] (''Pandion haliaetus'').\n\n==Systematics==\n===Historical classifications===\nThe taxonomy of [[Carl Linnaeus]] grouped birds (class Aves) into orders, genera, and species, with no formal ranks between genus and order. He placed all birds of prey into a single order, ''Accipitres'', subdividing this into four genera: ''[[Vulture|Vultur]]'' (vultures), ''[[Falco (bird)|Falco]]'' (eagles, hawks, falcons, etc.), ''[[Strix (genus)|Strix]]'' (owls), and ''[[Lanius]]'' (shrikes). This approach was followed by subsequent authors such as Gmelin, Latham, and Turnton.\n\n[[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot|Louis Pierre Veillot]] used additional ranks: order, tribe, family, genus, species.

A brief overview from abstract of the published paper shows that \"clutch size and hunting strategies have been proved to be the most important variables in shaping distribution areas, and also the geographic dissimilarities may mask important relationships between life history traits and migratory behaviours.

It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause for sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimonious]], meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the [[sexual selection]]  model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=H.C.|title=The Evolution of Reversed Sexual Dimorphism in Owls: An Empirical Analysis of Possible Selective Factors|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=98|issue=3|pages=387\u2013406}}</ref>\n\nDimorphisms can also be the product of [[intrasexual selection]] between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males competing with other males for adequate hunting ground so they appear as the most healthy mate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wiehn|first1=J.|last2=Korpimakki|first2=E.|last3=Massemin|first3=S.|title=Reversed sexual size dimorphism in raptors: evaluation of the hypotheses in kestrels breeding in a temporally changing environment|journal=Oecologia|year=2000|volume=124|issue=1|pages=26\u201332|doi=10.1007/s004420050021|pmid=28308409|bibcode=2000Oecol.124...26M}}</ref>\nIt has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of [[disruptive selection]], and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. Sexual dimorphism can be viewed as something that can accelerate the rate of speciation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=BOLNICK|first1=David|last2=DOEBEL|first2=Michael|title=SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND ADAPTIVE SPECIATION: TWO SIDES OF THE SAME ECOLOGICAL COIN|journal=The Society of Evolution|date=November 2003|volume=57|issue=11}}</ref>\n\nIn non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case. For instance, the [[kestrel]] is a type of falcon in which males are the primary providers, and the females are responsible for nurturing the young. In this species, the smaller the kestrels are, the less food is needed and thus, they can survive in environments that are harsher. This is particularly true in the male kestrels. It has become more energetically favorable for male kestrels to remain smaller than their female counterparts because smaller males have an agility advantage when it comes to defending the nest and hunting. Larger females are favored because they can incubate larger numbers of offspring, while also being able to breed a larger clutch size.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sonerud|first1=G|last2=Steen|first2=R|last3=Low|first3=L|last4=Roed|first4=L.|last5=Skar|first5=K.|last6=Selas|first6=V|last7=Slagsvold|first7=T|title=Size-biased allocation of prey from male to offspring via female: family conflicts, prey selection, and evolution of sexual size dimorphism in raptors|journal=Oceologa|date=2013|volume=172|issue=1|pages=93\u2013107|doi=10.1007/s00442-012-2491-9|pmid=23073637|bibcode=2013Oecol.172...93S}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Birds}}\n* [[Origin of birds]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |title=British birds of prey : a study of Britain's 24 diurnal raptors |last=Brown |first=Leslie |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2013 |isbn=9780007406487 |location=Hammersmith, London }}\n*{{cite book |title=Birds of Prey Hawks, Eagles, Falcons, and Vultures of North America |last1=Dunne |first1=Pete |last2=Karlson |first2=Kevin |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2017 |isbn=9780544018440 |oclc=953709935 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Raptor : a journey through birds |last=Macdonald Lockhart |first=James |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=2017 |isbn=9780226470580  |location=Chicago |oclc=959200538 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Birds of prey |last=Mackenzie |first=John P.

The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system. For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is commonly used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response. For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.

They were soon renamed the \"Rifle Corps\". In January 1803, they became an established regular regiment and were titled the 95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles). In 1816, at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], they were again renamed, this time as the \"Rifle Brigade\".\n\nThe unit was distinguished by its use of green uniforms in place of the traditional redcoat as well as by being armed with the [[Baker rifle]], which was the first British-made rifle accepted by the British Army in place of smooth-bore muskets.  The 95th was the first regular infantry corps in the British Army to be so armed. They performed distinguished service in both the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. Post war, in 1958 the regiment formed part of the Green Jackets Brigade as 3rd Green Jackets and was amalgamated with the [[1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd)]] and the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|2nd Green Jackets (King's Royal Rifle Corps)]] to form the [[Royal Green Jackets]] on 1 January 1966.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nIn 1800, an \"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\", was raised by Colonel [[Coote Manningham]] and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. [[William Stewart (British Army officer, born 1774)|William Stewart]], drawn from officers and other ranks from drafts of a variety of British regiments.

In 1816, at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], they were again renamed, this time as the \"Rifle Brigade\".\n\nThe unit was distinguished by its use of green uniforms in place of the traditional redcoat as well as by being armed with the [[Baker rifle]], which was the first British-made rifle accepted by the British Army in place of smooth-bore muskets.  The 95th was the first regular infantry corps in the British Army to be so armed. They performed distinguished service in both the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. Post war, in 1958 the regiment formed part of the Green Jackets Brigade as 3rd Green Jackets and was amalgamated with the [[1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd)]] and the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|2nd Green Jackets (King's Royal Rifle Corps)]] to form the [[Royal Green Jackets]] on 1 January 1966.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nIn 1800, an \"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\", was raised by Colonel [[Coote Manningham]] and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. [[William Stewart (British Army officer, born 1774)|William Stewart]], drawn from officers and other ranks from drafts of a variety of British regiments. The Corps differed in several regards from the line infantry of the British Army and most significantly were armed with the formidable [[Baker rifle]].<ref name=forming>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/rb/forming.htm|title=1800 The Forming of the Regiment|publisher=Green Jackets|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> The rifle was remarkably accurate in an era when it was generally considered impractical for individual soldiers to aim at specific targets.<ref>Nosworthy, Brent (1997), \"Battle tactics of Napoleon and his enemies\", Constable</ref> Riflemen wore dark green jackets rather than the bright red coats of the British line infantry regiments of that time, close-fitting pantaloons rather than breeches, black [[Facing colour|facings]] and black belts rather than white and a green plume on their \"stovepipe [[shako]]es\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/Britain/Infantry/Rifles/c_rifles.html |title=What a British Rifleman Carried in 1809 |publisher=Napoleon Series |accessdate=18 June 2016 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200203/http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/Britain/Infantry/Rifles/c_rifles.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===As the Rifle Corps===\nFour months after its formation, the Rifle Corps was judged ready for its first operation.

Despite this, the expedition was defeated and withdrew on 26 August 1800.<ref name=forming/> In April 1801, one company of the Experimental Corps of Riflemen, under the command of Captain Sidney Beckwith, took part in the British victory at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]], as marksmen aboard Royal Navy ships that were under the overall command of Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]].

Despite the terrifying pictures drawn by the ''[[Morning Post]]'' and the [[British Empire Union]], we in the party know to our cost, and do not conceal it...that our party numbers only some thousands of members, of whom perhaps half are \"active,\" i.e., propagandists, agitators, organizers, literature-sellers, writers, etc. The party has not a great many more members than those organisations which were represented at the first and second unity congresses in August 1920 and January 1921.... We have some members active in the trade unions, less in the trades councils, and very few in the workshops.... The masses do not attend branch meetings. We shall find them where they are to be found daily \u2014 at the 'point of production': the workshop, pit, depot, stores, or office....<br /><br />\n\"How can we extend our influence in the workshops? By means of the ''Workers' Weekly:'' by making it interesting to those in the workshops; by reflecting in it the daily life of the workshops; by building it up, in short, around letters from the workships, because the constitute the first link in the chain, the first like that we must take hold of and hold on to with all our might, knowing that only in that way we shall arrive at what we desire.\"<ref>\"C.M.

The first issue of the new paper was dated 10 February 1923.<ref name=\"Klugmann, pg. 215\"/> The change of name was to reflect a parallel change in the publication's approach, emphasizing the daily life and shop concerns of the working class as well as noteworthy events in the [[Labour Movement]]. In his article in the monthly theoretical magazine of the CPGB announcing the switch, [[Andrew Rothstein]] declared that the revamped publication was to mark a move away from being \"a weekly journal for the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Communist household\" and towards becoming \"a live reporter and interpreter of the working class life and struggle.\"<ref>\"Roebuck\" [Rothstein], \"The Party Organ,\" pg. 571.</ref>\n\n[[Rajani Palme Dutt|R. Palme Dutt]] was editor of the revamped publication.<ref>Ure-Smith, \"The Bolshevik Press in Britain,\" pg. 51.</ref> Following the [[Communist International|Comintern's]] emphasis of the day, the new paper attached particular importance to letters from [[worker-correspondent]]s, publishing over 2,500 letters and reports submitted from the [[grassroots]] in its first year.<ref>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain,'' vol. 1, pg. 216.</ref>\n\nOn February 17, 1923, the paper explicitly stated the change in direction:\n<blockquote>\n\"We want a paper made by the workers for the workers. Our news is working class news supplied by the workers on the spot. It may not be very wonderful news yet, but you can improve that for us by seeing that we get the news that you won't get in other papers. It is the news of the workers.\"<ref>Quoted in Ure-Smith, \"The Bolshevik Press in Britain,\" pg. 52.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCirculation once again began to rise. The first issue of ''The Workers' Weekly'' had a press run of 19,000 and sold out within 24 hours of publication.<ref>''Workers' Weekly,'' 17 February 1924.

Despite the terrifying pictures drawn by the ''[[Morning Post]]'' and the [[British Empire Union]], we in the party know to our cost, and do not conceal it...that our party numbers only some thousands of members, of whom perhaps half are \"active,\" i.e., propagandists, agitators, organizers, literature-sellers, writers, etc. The party has not a great many more members than those organisations which were represented at the first and second unity congresses in August 1920 and January 1921.... We have some members active in the trade unions, less in the trades councils, and very few in the workshops.... The masses do not attend branch meetings. We shall find them where they are to be found daily \u2014 at the 'point of production': the workshop, pit, depot, stores, or office....<br /><br />\n\"How can we extend our influence in the workshops? By means of the ''Workers' Weekly:'' by making it interesting to those in the workshops; by reflecting in it the daily life of the workshops; by building it up, in short, around letters from the workships, because the constitute the first link in the chain, the first like that we must take hold of and hold on to with all our might, knowing that only in that way we shall arrive at what we desire.\"<ref>\"C.M. Roebuck\" [Andrew Rothstein], \"The Party Organ: What It Can Do for the Movement,\" ''Communist Review,'' vol. 3, no. 12 (April 1923), pp. 579-580.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe governing Executive Committee of the CPGB had decided to replace ''The Communist'' with a new publication called the ''Workers' Weekly.'' The first issue of the new paper was dated 10 February 1923.<ref name=\"Klugmann, pg. 215\"/> The change of name was to reflect a parallel change in the publication's approach, emphasizing the daily life and shop concerns of the working class as well as noteworthy events in the [[Labour Movement]]. In his article in the monthly theoretical magazine of the CPGB announcing the switch, [[Andrew Rothstein]] declared that the revamped publication was to mark a move away from being \"a weekly journal for the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Communist household\" and towards becoming \"a live reporter and interpreter of the working class life and struggle.\"<ref>\"Roebuck\" [Rothstein], \"The Party Organ,\" pg. 571.</ref>\n\n[[Rajani Palme Dutt|R. Palme Dutt]] was editor of the revamped publication.<ref>Ure-Smith, \"The Bolshevik Press in Britain,\" pg. 51.</ref> Following the [[Communist International|Comintern's]] emphasis of the day, the new paper attached particular importance to letters from [[worker-correspondent]]s, publishing over 2,500 letters and reports submitted from the [[grassroots]] in its first year.<ref>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain,'' vol. 1, pg. 216.</ref>\n\nOn February 17, 1923, the paper explicitly stated the change in direction:\n<blockquote>\n\"We want a paper made by the workers for the workers. Our news is working class news supplied by the workers on the spot. It may not be very wonderful news yet, but you can improve that for us by seeing that we get the news that you won't get in other papers. It is the news of the workers.\"<ref>Quoted in Ure-Smith, \"The Bolshevik Press in Britain,\" pg. 52.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCirculation once again began to rise. The first issue of ''The Workers' Weekly'' had a press run of 19,000 and sold out within 24 hours of publication.<ref>''Workers' Weekly,'' 17 February 1924. Cited in Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain,'' vol. 1, pg. 216.</ref> By the end of March, the press run had increased considerably, to over 50,000 copies.<ref>''Workers' Weekly,'' 31 March 1924. Cited in Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain,'' vol. 1, pg. 216.</ref>\n\n===Dissolution===\n\nCirculation peaked at 80,000 copies in August 1926, in the aftermath of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].<ref name=Macfarlane178>L.J.

In many countries of the world, [[government funding|funding]] comes from governments, especially via annual [[Broadcasting license fee | fee]]s charged on receivers. In the [[United States]], public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and [[business]]es (ranging from small shops to corporations), along with audience contributions via [[pledge drive]]s. The great majority operate as private [[not-for-profit corporation]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nPublic broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated, depending on the country and the station. In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting. Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages. Historically, public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries (with the notable exception of the United States). [[Commercial broadcasting]] now also exists in most of these countries; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date= August 2011}}\n\n==Definition==\nThe primary mission of public broadcasting is that of public service, speaking to and engaging as a citizen.<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting \u2013 Why, How?|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001240/124058eo.pdf|publisher=UNESCO & World Radio and Television Council|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> The British model has been widely accepted as a universal definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nosuch-research.co.uk/pppp.html|title=BRU definition of public service broadcasting|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=raboy>{{cite book|last=Raboy|first=Marc|title=Public broadcasting for the 21st century|year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=1-86020-006-0|pages=6\u201310}}</ref><ref name=psbGlobal>{{cite book|last=Banerjee|first=Indrajit|title=Public service broadcasting in the age of globalization|year=2006|publisher=Asian Media Information and Communication Centre (AMIC)|isbn=981-4136-01-8}}</ref> The model embodies the following principles:\n\n* Universal geographic accessibility\n* Universal appeal\n* Attention to minorities\n* Contribution to national identity and sense of community\n* Distance from vested interests\n* Direct funding and universality of payment\n* Competition in good programming rather than numbers\n* Guidelines that liberate rather than restrict\n\nWhile application of certain principles may be straightforward, as in the case of accessibility, some of the principles may be poorly defined or difficult to implement. In the context of a shifting national identity, the role of public broadcasting may be unclear. Likewise, the subjective nature of good programming may raise the question of individual or public taste.<ref name=raboy/>\n\nWithin public broadcasting there are two different views regarding commercial activity. One is that public broadcasting is incompatible with commercial objectives. The other is that public broadcasting can and should compete in the marketplace with commercial broadcasters. This dichotomy is highlighted by the public service aspects of traditional commercial broadcasters.<ref name=raboy/>\n\nPublic broadcasters in each jurisdiction may or may not be synonymous with government controlled broadcasters. In some countries like the UK public broadcasters are not sanctioned by government departments and have independent means of funding, and thus enjoy editorial independence.\n\n==Technology==\nPublic broadcasting utilizes [[radio]], [[television]], and [[internet]] technologies.\n===Radio===\n[[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio are used for public broadcasting.\n\n==Economics==\nPublic broadcasters may receive their funding from an obligatory [[television licence]] fee, individual contributions, government funding or commercial sources. Public broadcasters do not rely on advertising to the same degree as commercial broadcasters, or at all; this allows public broadcasters to transmit programmes that are not commercially viable to the [[mass market]], such as [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] shows, [[radio documentary|radio]] and [[documentary film|television documentaries]], and [[educational programme]]s.\n\nOne of the principles of public broadcasting is to provide coverage of interests for which there are missing or small markets. Public broadcasting attempts to supply topics of social benefit that are otherwise not provided by commercial broadcasters. Typically, such underprovision is argued to exist when the benefits to viewers are relatively high in comparison to the benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers.<ref name=andcoate /> This frequently is the case in undeveloped countries that normally have low benefits to advertising.<ref name=andcoate>{{cite journal|author1=Simon P. Anderson|author2=Stephen Coate|title=Market Provision of Broadcasting: A Welfare Analysis|journal=[[The Review of Economic Studies]]|date=October 2005|volume=72|issue=4|pages=947\u2013972 |doi=10.1111/0034-6527.00357 }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural policy==\nAdditionally, public broadcasting may facilitate the implementation of a [[cultural policy]] (an [[industrial policy]] and [[investment policy]] for culture). Examples include:\n\n*The Canadian government is committed to [[Canadian official bilingualism|official bilingualism]] (English and French). As a result, the public broadcaster, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] employs translators and journalists who speak both official languages and it encourages production of cross-cultural material.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} \n*In the UK, the [[BBC]] supports multiculturalism and diversity, in part by using on-screen commentators and hosts of different ethnic origins. There are also [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Irish and Scottish Gaelic language programmes for the home nations, an Asian Network broadcasting in English and five major languages of South Asia, and the BBC World Service broadcasts in 31 international languages, also funded independently of government.\n*In New Zealand, the public broadcasting system provides support to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] broadcasting, with the stated intention of improving their opportunities, maintaining their cultural heritage and promoting their language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n*In Australia, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] is legally required to 'encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia' and 'broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity' with specific emphasis on regional and rural Australia'.<ref>Charter of the Corporation (ABC). [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/ABCcharter.htm Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983: Section 6].</ref> Furthermore, the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) is intended to reflect the spirit and sense of multicultural richness and the unique international cultural values within Australian society.\n\n==Worldwide==\nThe model, established in the 1920s, of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]\u2014an organization widely trusted, even by citizens of the [[Axis Powers]]{{according to whom|date=March 2020}} during World War II\u2014was widely emulated throughout Europe, the [[British Empire]], and later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The public broadcasters in a number of countries are basically an application of the model used in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nModern public broadcasting is often a mixed commercial model. For example, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] is funded by advertising revenue supplemented by a government subsidy to support its television service.\n\n===Americas===\n\n====Argentina====\nState presence in television had a strong history, not in the way of European style public service radio or television.\nThe private sector has taken an active role in the development of television in Buenos Aires. In opposition, state broadcasters tend to be federal and technical innovative, such as the\n[[Televisi\u00f3n P\u00fablica Argentina]], the first national TV station, 68 years old.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn Brazil, the two main national public broadcasters are EBC ([[Empresa Brasil de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o]], Brazil Communication Company) and the [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta]] (Padre Anchieta Foundation). The EBC was created in 2007 to manage the Brazilian federal government's radio and television stations. EBC owns broadcast networks such as [[TV Brasil]] (launched in 2007, being the merger of [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s TV Educativa (1975\u20132007) and [[Bras\u00edlia]]'s TV Nacional (1960\u20132007), and the stations [[R\u00e1dio Nacional|Nacional]] and Radio MEC in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro. The Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta was created by the government of the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1967 and includes a television station ([[TV Cultura]], launched in 1969 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]), and two radio stations (R\u00e1dio Cultura FM and R\u00e1dio Cultura Brasil). The Padre Anchieta Foundation is a privately held company which maintains autonomy. \n\nMany Brazilian states also have regional public radio and television stations, all of them members of the Brazilian Association of Public, Educational and Cultural Broadcasters (ABEPEC). This is the case of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], which has the ''Empresa Mineira de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o'' (EMC, Minas Gerais Communication Company), a public company created in 2016, formed by [[Rede Minas]], the public television channel and the two stations of [[R\u00e1dio Inconfid\u00eancia]] (which also broadcasts in [[shortwave]]). The state of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] also has its own public radio (''R\u00e1dio Esp\u00edrito Santo'') and television (''Televis\u00e3o Educativa do Esp\u00edrito Santo - TVE-ES'', Educational Television of Esp\u00edrito Santo). In [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the public television station is the TVE-RS (Televis\u00e3o Educativa do Rio Grande do Sul, Educational Television of Rio Grande do Sul) and a radio station (FM Cultura). The regional public television channels in Brazil are affiliates and broadcast part of TV Brasil or TV Cultura programming.\n\nCurrently, EBC undergoes several critics by some conservative politicians for having a supposed left-leaning bias. The current president of Brazil, [[Jair Bolsonaro]], intends to extinguish the EBC.<ref>https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/promessa-de-campanha-ebc-sera-extinta-afirma-bolsonaro-23708282</ref><ref>https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/2019-05-31/em-entrevista-bolsonaro-diz-que-extincao-da-ebc-esta-decidida.html</ref>\n\n====Canada====\n{{see also|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}\nIn Canada, the main public broadcaster is the national [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC; {{lang-fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada}}), a [[state-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] \u2013 which originated as a radio network in November 1936. It is the successor to the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC), which was established by the administration of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R.B. Bennett]] in 1932, modeled on recommendations made in 1929 by the [[Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting]] and stemming from lobbying efforts by the [[Canadian Radio League]]. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation took over operation of the CRBC's nine radio stations (which were largely concentrated in major cities across Canada, including [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]]). The CBC eventually expanded to television in September 1952 with the sign-on of [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]] in Montreal, the first television station in Canada to initiate full-time broadcasts, which initially served as a primary affiliate of the French language T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada and a secondary affiliate of the [[Canadian English|English language]] CBC Television service.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Birth and Death of The Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (1932-1936)|url=https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/birth-and-death-canadian-radio-broadcasting-commission-1932-1936|website=[[Canadian Communications Foundation]]|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCBC operates two national television networks ([[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]]), four radio networks ([[CBC Radio One]], [[CBC Radio 2]], [[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]] and [[Ici Musique]]) and several cable television channels including two 24-hour news channels ([[CBC News Network]] and [[Ici RDI]]) in both of Canada's official languages \u2013 English and French \u2013 and the French-language channels [[Ici Explora]] and [[Ici ARTV]], dedicated to science and culture respectively. CBC's national television operations and some radio operations are funded partly by advertisements, in addition to the subsidy provided by the federal government. The cable channels are commercial entities owned and operated by the CBC and do not receive any direct public funds, however, they do benefit from synergies with resources from the other CBC operations. The CBC has frequently dealt with budget cuts and labour disputes, often resulting in a debate about whether the service has the resources necessary to properly fulfill its mandate.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, all of CBC Television's terrestrial stations are [[owned-and-operated station|owned and operated]] by the CBC directly. The number of privately owned CBC Television affiliates has gradually declined in recent years, as the network has moved its programming to stations opened by the corporation or has purchased certain affiliates from private broadcasting groups; budgetary issues led the CBC to choose not to launch new rebroadcast transmitters in markets where the network disaffiliated from a private station after 2006; the network dropped its remaining private affiliates in 2016, when [[CJDC-TV]]/[[Dawson Creek]] and [[CFTK-TV]]/[[Terrace, British Columbia]] defected from CBC Television that February and [[Lloydminster]]-based [[CKSA-DT]] disaffiliated in August of that year (to become affiliates of [[CTV Two]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]], respectively). The CBC's decision to disaffiliate from these and other privately owned stations, as well as the corporation decommissioning its network of rebroadcasters following [[Digital terrestrial television in Canada|Canada's transition to digital television]] in August 2011 have significantly reduced the terrestrial coverage of both CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9; the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) does require cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry CBC and Radio-Canada stations as part of their basic tier, regardless of terrestrial availability in an individual market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadcast Distribution Regulations (ss. 17(d) and 17(f))|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-97-555/FullText.html#s-17|website=Justice Laws Website|publisher=[[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]]|date=February 28, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Of the three major French-language television networks in Canada, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9 is the only one that maintains terrestrial owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in all ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], although it maintains only one station ([[Moncton, New Brunswick]]-based [[CBAFT-DT]]) that serves the four provinces comprising [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nIn recent years, the CBC has also expanded into [[new media]] ventures including the online radio service [[CBC Radio 3]], [[music streaming]] service [[CBC Music]], and the launch of online news services, such as [[CBC Hamilton]], in some markets which are not directly served by their own CBC television or radio stations.\n\nIn addition, several provinces operate public broadcasters; these are not CBC subentities, but distinct networks in their own right. Most of the provincial services maintain an educational programming format, differing from the primarily entertainment-based CBC/Radio-Canada operations, but more closely formatted to (and carrying many of the same programs as) the U.S.-based [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), which itself is available terrestrially and \u2013 under a CRTC rule that requires Canadian cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry affiliates of the four major U.S. commercial networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) and a PBS member station<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian cablecos to do the FOX trot.|newspaper=Alberta Report / Newsmagazine|page=43|date=September 12, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Canada-U.S. cross-border station shake-up|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canada-cross-border-station-shake-87165|author=Etan Vlessing|agency=Associated Press|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Holdings|The Nielsen Company]]|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> \u2013 through pay television providers in Canada via member stations located near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Canada border]]. These educational public broadcasters include the English-language [[TVOntario]] (TVO) and the French-language [[TFO]] in [[Ontario]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]] in [[Quebec]], and [[Knowledge Network]] in [[British Columbia]]. TVO and T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec operate through conventional transmitters and cable, while TFO and Knowledge Network are cable-only channels. Beyond these and other provincial services, Canada does not have a national public educational network.\n\n[[File:CJAI-islandradio-summer2010.jpg|thumb|right|Amherst Island public radio]]\nCanada is also home to a number of former public broadcasting entities that have gone private. [[CTV Two Alberta]], which is licensed as an educational television station in Alberta, was once owned by the [[Government of Alberta|Alberta government]] as the public broadcaster Access. In 1993, the provincial government agreed to cease to direct funding of Access after the 1994 fiscal year; the channel was sold to [[CHUM Limited]] in 1995, which initially acquired the channel through a majority-owned subsidiary, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Limited (LSTA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1995/DB95-472.HTM|title=Decision CRTC 95-472|publisher=CRTC|date=1995-07-20|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> To fulfill its license conditions as an educational station, it broadcasts educational and children's programming during the [[daytime television|daytime]] hours, while airing entertainment programming favoured by advertisers and viewers in prime time. The service discontinued its broadcast transmitters in [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] in August 2011, due to the expense of transitioning the two stations to [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]], and the fact that the service had mandatory carriage on television providers serving Alberta regardless of whether it ran over-the-air transmitters. The service has since operated as part of [[Bell Media]]'s [[CTV Two]] chain of stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201012616|title=Applicant response dated 6 December 2010|accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref>\n\nPublic radio station [[CKUA Radio Network|CKUA]] in Alberta was also formerly operated by Access, before being sold to the [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] CKUA Radio Foundation which continues to operate it as a community-funded radio network. [[CJRT-FM]] in Toronto also operated as a public government-owned radio station for many years; while no longer funded by the provincial government, it still solicits most of its budget from listener and corporate donations and is permitted to air only a very small amount of commercial advertising.\n\n[[City Saskatchewan]] originated as the Saskatchewan Communications Network, a cable-only educational and cultural public broadcaster owned by the [[government of Saskatchewan]]. SCN was sold to Bluepoint Investment Corporation in 2010, and like CTV Two Alberta did when it became privatized, incorporated a limited schedule of entertainment programming during the late afternoon and nighttime hours, while retaining educational and children's programs during the morning until mid-afternoon to fulfill its licensing conditions; Bluepoint later sold the channel to [[Rogers Media]] in 2012, expanding a relationship it began with SCN in January of that year, when Rogers began supplying entertainment programming to the channel through an affiliation agreement with its English-language broadcast network, [[City (TV network)|Citytv]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2010/06/21/sk-scn-sale-1006.html Sask.

In addition, cable companies are required to produce a local [[Community channel (Canada)|community channel]] in each licensed market. Such channels have traditionally aired community talk shows, city council meetings and other locally oriented programming, although it is becoming increasingly common for them to adopt the format and branding of a local news channel.\n\nCanada also has a large number of [[campus radio]] and [[community radio]] stations.\n\n====Colombia====\n[[Colombia]] had between 1955 and 1998 a public television system very similar to that adopted by the NPO in the Netherlands, where private television producers called \"''[[programadora]]s''\" were given hours on the country's two public television channels ([[Canal 1 (Colombia)|Cadena Uno]] and [[Canal A]]). In 1998, when the Colombian government allowed the opening of television to the private market by granting two broadcast licenses to the ''programadoras'' Caracol Televisi\u00f3n and RCN Televisi\u00f3n, these television producers went into crisis, causing many to end their activities or produce content for the private television channels. Currently, Colombia has three public channels (one is operated by a private company formed by the shares of four former ''programadoras'') and eight public radio stations (three stations are regional broadcasters).\n\n====Chile====\nChilean television was founded through universities, in an attempt to bring public television without the state having to pay directly and control content. The University of Chile (owner of the former Channels&nbsp;9 and 11 until 1993), the Catholic University of Chile on channels 2 and 13 until 2010, and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso]] on channels&nbsp;8 and 4. Channel&nbsp;8, in [[Valpara\u00edso]], is the first and oldest station on Chile, transmitting since October 5, 1957. As soon as 1961 universities began transmitting advertisements between their programs, the first of them being the channel&nbsp;9, showing a Motorola TV set. This kind of disguised advertising took the name of \"Payola\". This situation, added to the fact that TV was only reaching [[Santiago]] and [[Valpara\u00edso]], led to the creation of a state network that should serve the whole country. This network, created in 1964 and in operation since October 24, 1969, is known as \"[[Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile]]\". After the military government of [[Augusto Pinochet]], television was mostly deregulated. Thus, two new commercial channels were born: Megavisi\u00f3n (Channel&nbsp;9, on October 23, 1990) and La Red (Channel&nbsp;4, on May 12, 1991). The University of Chile's channel&nbsp;11 also was rented to a private operator on October 1, 1993 and is today known today as \"Chilevisi\u00f3n\".\n\nTelevisi\u00f3n Nacional, popularly known as channel 7 because of its [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] frequency, is governed by a seven-member board appointed by both the [[President of Chile|President]] and [[Chilean Senate|the Senate]]. It is meant to be independent of political pressures, although accusations of bias have been made, especially during election campaigns.\n\n====Ecuador====\n[[Ecuador TV]] is the public service channel of Ecuador, established in October 2007. The channel was established at the same time as the installation of the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] so that the sessions could be transmitted live to all the country.\n\n==== El Salvador ====\nSalvadoran broadcasting has a public service radio and television channel. On March 1, 1926 began the operation as the first Central American broadcasting network called \"[[Radio Nacional de El Salvador]]\" with a frequency of 96.9 FM MHz founded by the president of that era, [[Alfonso Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez Molina]]. On November 4, 1964 the Government of El Salvador founded [[TVES (El Salvador)|Televisi\u00f3n de El Salvador]] as an educational television with the channels 8 and 10. And since 1989, Channel 10 turned as the channel of \"Televisi\u00f3n de El Salvador\" as the only public television service in El Salvador.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nIn Mexico, public stations were operated by state governments, universities and agencies of the state government, and five national public channels were founded. [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Canal Once]] was owned, and operated by a Mexican institution of higher education since March 2, 1959 as the first public broadcasting television in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canalonce.mx/sobre-canal-once/|title=El Once y su historia|access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> The [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|government of Mexico]] implemented [[Telesecundaria]] in 1968 to provide [[secondary education]] to students in rural areas through broadcast television channels, such as [[XHGC-TV]] in Mexico City. With the launching of the [[Morelos II]] satellite, Telesecundaria began transmitting on one of its analog channels in 1988; in 1994 it began broadcasting in digital format with the advent of the Solidaridad I satellite, and [[Televisi\u00f3n Educativa (Mexico)|Edusat]] was born and began transmitting in Mexico, [[Central America]] and certain regions of the [[United States]]. In 1982, [[XEIMT-TDT|Canal 22]] was founded and began operations eleven years later by the [[Secretariat of Culture]] as part of the \"[[RED M\u00e9xico]]\". In 2005 the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM in Spanish) began transmissions as the sister channel of [[XEUN-AM]] and [[XEUN-FM]] (both radio stations founded in 1959), [[TV UNAM]] which is part of the university and cultural diffusion. [[Canal Catorce]] was operated by the [[Sistema P\u00fablico de Radiodifusi\u00f3n del Estado Mexicano]] (SPR) in 2012 as a part of \"[[La Red de Radiodifusoras y Televisoras Educativas y Culturales de M\u00e9xico|RED M\u00e9xico]]\".\n\n====United States====\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n{{main|Public broadcasting in the United States}}\n{{See also|Corporation for Public Broadcasting}}\n\n[[File:UIUC Gregory Hall 200511.jpg|thumb|upright|The Gregory Hall on the campus of [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] hosted an important meeting of the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] in the 1940s, that spawned both [[PBS]] and [[NPR]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}]]\n\nEarly public stations were operated by state colleges and universities, and were often run as part of the schools' [[cooperative extension service]]s.

From the beginning, the network has refused corporate funding of any kind, and has relied mainly on listener support. KPFA gave away free FM radios to build a listener base and to encourage listeners to \"subscribe\" (support the station directly with donations). It is the world's oldest listener-supported radio network.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Future Active: Media Activism and the Internet|last=Meikle|first=Graham|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-94322-2|location=|pages=71}}</ref> Since the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Pacifica has sometimes received CPB support. Pacifica runs other stations in [[KPFK|Los Angeles]], [[WBAI|New York City]], [[WPFW|Washington, DC.]] and [[KPFT|Houston]], as well as repeater stations and a large network of affiliates.\n\nA national public radio network, National Public Radio (NPR), was created in February 1970, as byproduct of the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. This network replaced the Ford Foundation-backed [[National Educational Radio Network]]. Some independent local public radio stations buy their programming from distributors such as NPR; [[Public Radio International]] (PRI); [[American Public Media]] (APM); [[Public Radio Exchange]] (PRX); and [[Pacifica Radio]], most often distributed through the Public Radio Satellite System.<ref>George H.

When it launched in October 1970, PBS assumed many of the functions of its predecessor, [[National Educational Television]] (NET).

In addition, the Radiodifusi\u00f3n Nacional de Uruguay is a network of radios with 4 different stations in AM and FM that cover the whole country.\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Afghanistan====\n[[Radio Television Afghanistan]] (RTA) is the public broadcaster of Afghanistan and dates back to 1925.\n\n====Bangladesh====\nThe Bengali primary state television broadcaster is [[Bangladesh Television]] which also broadcasts worldwide through its satellite based branch, [[BTV World]]. There are also terrestrial state run TV channels: [[Sangsad TV]] owned and operated by [[Bengali parliament]] that covers the proceedings of the Parliament.\nThe [[Bangladesh Betar]] (BB) is the country's sole state radio broadcaster. Radio transmission in the region now forming Bangladesh started in Dhaka on December 16, 1939. The [[Ministry of Information (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Information]] is responsible for the administration of all government TV channels and Radio.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:RTHK.jpg|thumb|Broadcasting House, the longtime headquarters of RTHK]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Radio Television Hong Kong ([[RTHK]]) is the sole public service broadcaster. Although a government department under administrative hierarchy, it enjoys [[editorial independence]]. It operates seven radio channels, and produces television programmes and broadcast on commercial television channels, as these channels are required by law to provide time slot for RTHK television programmes. RTHK would be assigned a digital terrestrial television channel within 2013 to 2015.\n\n====India====\nIn India, [[Prasar Bharati]] is India's public broadcaster. However it does have commercial advertising on it. It is an autonomous corporation of the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)]], Government of India and comprises the [[Doordarshan]] television network and [[All India Radio]]. Prasar Bharati was established on 23 November 1997, following a demand that the government owned broadcasters in India should be given autonomy like those in many other countries. The Parliament of India passed an Act to grant this autonomy in 1990, but it was not enacted until 15 September 1997.\n\n==== Israel ====\nIn Israel, the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|Israeli Broadcasting Authority]] was the country's main public broadcasting service until 2017.\n\nAs of May 15, 2017, it was replaced by '''[[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|KAN]]''' (Hebrew for \"here\"), the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nIn Arabic, the IPBC is known by the name '''MAKAN''' (Arabic for \"place\").\n\nKAN has inherited the two main public TV channels in Israel:\n* [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]], as of 2017 \"'''[[KAN 11]]'''\" - Main TV channel\n* [[Channel 33 (Israel)]], as of 2017 \"'''MAKAN 33'''\" - Arabic language TV channel\nKAN also includes the following 8 public radio stations, taken from IBA:\n* Reshet Alef (Network A), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Tarbut'''\" - Podcasts and talk programs related to culture\n* Reshet Bet (Network B), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Bet'''\" - News and current affairs\n* Reshet Gimel (Network C), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Gimel'''\" - Israeli music\n* Reshet Dalet (Network D), as of 2017 \"'''MAKAN Radio'''\" - Arabic language station\n* Reshet Hey (Network E), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Farsi'''\" - Persian language station, internet only\n* 88FM, as of 2017 \"'''KAN 88'''\" - Alternative music\n* Kol Hamusika (\"The Sound of Music\"), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Kol Hamusika'''\" - Classical music, jazz\n* REKA - Reshet Klitat [[Aliyah]] (Aliyah integration network), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Reka'''\" - Multilingual, mostly Russian language station\n* Reshet Moreshet, as of 2017 \"'''KAN Moreshet'''\" - Jewish-related news and programming\n\nThe [[Israeli Defense Forces]] owns its own broadcasting network known as IDF Waves which includes 2 radio stations: \n* IDF Waves ([[Galey Tzahal]]) - broadcasting news and current affairs\n* [[Galgalatz]] - broadcasting music and traffic reports\nIn addition, the ministry of education owns the [[Israeli Educational Television]], known as '''Hinuchit''', the first Israeli television channel. It was created by the Rothschild fund to aid the ministry's work in teaching children from kindergarten to high school and to promote the television's use in Israel at a time the government considered the device a \"cultural decadence\". It is funded and operated by the ministry, and since the 1980s it has widened its orientation to adults as well as children. In August 2018, the Educational Television will be shut down and replaced by '''KAN Hinuchit'''.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, the main public broadcaster is the [[NHK]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). The broadcaster was set up in 1926 and was modelled on the [[British Broadcasting Company]], the precursor to the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] created in 1927. Much like the BBC, NHK is funded by a \"receiving fee\" from every Japanese household, with no commercial advertising and the maintenance of a position of strict political impartiality. However, rampant non-payment by a large amount of households has led the receiving fee to become something of a political issue. NHK runs two national terrestrial TV stations (NHK General and NHK Educational) and two [[satellite]] only services (NHK BS1 and NHK BS Premium services). NHK also runs 3 national radio services and a number of international radio and television services, akin to the [[BBC World Service]]. NHK has also been an innovator in television, developing the world's first [[High definition TV|high definition television]] technology in 1964 and launching high definition services in Japan in 1981.\n\n====Macau====\nIn [[Macau]], Teledifus\u00e3o de Macau [[Teledifus\u00e3o de Macau|TDM]] is the public service broadcasting company. The firm was established in January 1982 and was modelled on R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]]. TDM has two independent editorial arms: the Chinese news channel and the Portuguese news channel, each of which may have different information sources, points of view, and priorities of news. TDM runs both television and radio services.\n\n====Malaysia====\nThe public broadcaster in Malaysia is the state-owned [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] (RTM). RTM was previously funded publicly through money obtained from [[Television licence|television licensing]], however it is currently state-subsidised, as television licences have been abolished.\n\n{{As of|2017}} RTM operates 8 national, 16 state and 7 district radio stations as well as 2 national terrestrial television channels called [[TV1 (Malaysia)|TV1]] and [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]]. RTM has also done test transmissions on a new digital television channel called [[RTMi]]. Tests involving 2000 residential homes in the [[Klang Valley]] began in September 2006 and ended in March 2007.\n\n====Nepal====\nHistory of public broadcasting in Nepal started from 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AS_RFm-BmeZtZGc2ejdwbWJfNGdycmNjemdt&hl=en|title= Public Service Broadcasting in Nepal|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn Pakistan, the public broadcasters are the state-owned [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] (PBC), also known as Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television. In the past Radio Pakistan was partly funded  through money obtained from License fees. In 1999, the Nawaz Sharif government abolished license fees for Radio Pakistan and also abolished its tax exempt status protected under PBC Act 1973. The license fees for Pakistan Television continued. The license fees collection for PTV was given to WAPDA during Musharraf government. Currently WAPDA collects Rs. 35 per house hold on electricity bills as PTV license fees. Television Broadcasting started in Pakistan with a small pilot TV Station established at Lahore Radio from where transmission was first beamed in Black & White with effect from 26 November 1964. Television centres were established in Dhaka, Karachi and Rawalpindi/Islamabad in 1967 and in Peshawar and Quetta in 1974. PTV has various channels transmitting throughout the world including PTV National, PTV World, PTV 2, PTV Global, PTV Bolan etc. Radio Pakistan has stations covering all the major cities, it covers 80% of the country serving 95.5 Million listeners. It has world service in eleven languages daily.\n\n====Philippines====\nThe Philippines' primary state television broadcaster is [[People's Television Network]] (PTV). Created in 1974 as Government Television (GTV), PTV is no longer state subsidised except for a one-time equity funding for capital outlay in 1992. Aside from PTV, the other public broadcaster is the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC), which the government has already put up for sale. The government no longer holds a [[controlling interest]] in the former state broadcaster, [[Radio Philippines Network]] (RPN).\n\nThe [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) is the country's sole state radio broadcaster. Established in 1933 as KZFM by the American colonial [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Insular Government]], the radio station was passed to the Philippine government after the country [[Republic Day (Philippines)|became independent]] in 1946. Currently, PBS broadcasts its flagship network [[Radyo Pilipinas]] (formerly Radyo ng Bayan) through its 32 stations and selected affiliates nationwide.\n\nThe government is currently planning to propose the creation of a law that will merge and integrate PTV and PBS into a single entity, to be called the People's Broadcasting Corporation (PBC).\n\n====Qatar====\nQatar's public service broadcasting includes Qatar Television which focuses on local affairs, and [[Al Jazeera]] which appeals to a pan-Arab audience in its Arabic broadcasting and to a wider international audience with its English Channel broadcast.  \n\n====Singapore====\n[[Mediacorp]] is the only public broadcasting in Singapore.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea's representative public broadcasting television network is said to be [[Korean Broadcasting System]], or KBS. Originally a government-controlled channel, it is now an independent broadcasting system. KBS began broadcasting radio in 1947 and opened up to television industry in 1961, and officially founded its own identity by 1973. Another public broadcasting channel is the [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], or MBC. Known to be the second channel of the country, it also shares the roles of being national television with the KBS.\n\nSouth Korea also has another public broadcasting channel called [[Educational Broadcasting System]], or EBS. Originally considered to be an extension channel of the KBS, it was spun-off as an educational channel but retained its public broadcasting tasks. KBS and EBS mainly are funded by the commercials that they provide in their channels, but due to growing competitions, this is becoming a problem for them as well.\n\n====Taiwan====\n[[Public Television Service]], also called Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation, is the first independent public broadcasting institution in Taiwan, which broadcasts the Public Television Service Taiwan. Since its creation in 1998, PTS has produced several critically acclaimed dramatic programs and mini-series despite experiencing funding difficulties. PTS is bound up in speaking for the minorities, including the promotion of Hakka Chinese and Formosan-language programming, an effort that has contributed much to the \"Taiwanization\" movement.\n\n===Europe===\n{{see also|European Broadcasting Union}}\n\nIn most countries in Europe, state broadcasters are funded through a mix of advertising and public finance, either through a licence fee or directly from the government.\n\n====Albania====\n[[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar]] (RTSH) is the public broadcaster in [[Albania]].\n\n''Analogue TV''\n* ''Televizioni Shqiptar'' (TVSH) is the name of the first public channel of Albania. The domestic TV program is distributed analogically throughout the country and digitally in Tirana through RTSH HD.\n* ''TVSH 2'' is the second public TV channel dedicated mainly to sports and live events launched in 2003.\n\n''Digital TV''\n* ''RTSH HD'' a digital channel launched in 2012 broadcasts TVSH shows in high-definition quality.\n* ''RTSH Sport''\n* ''RTSH Muzik\u00eb''\n* ''RTSH Art'' \n* ''TVSH Sat'', is the international version of the domestic program broadcast to Europe free to air via [[satellite]].\n\n''Radio''\n*''Radio Tirana'' (also, Radio Tirana 1) is the name of Albania's first radio program, concentrating on news, talk, and features\n*''Radio Tirana 2'' is the name of the second radio program, broadcasting chiefly music and targeted at youth\n*''Radio Tirana 3 (Programi i Tret\u00eb, Radio Tirana International)'' is the name of the third program, broadcasting the international service on short wave radio in Albanian, English, French. Greek, German, Italian, Serbian, and Turkish\n\n''Regional''\n*''Radio Televizioni Gjirokastra'' is the local version of RTSH in [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]]\n*''Radio Televizioni Kor\u00e7a'' is the local version of RTSH in [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]]\n*''Radio Kuk\u00ebsi'' is the local version of RT in [[Kuk\u00ebs]]\n*''Radio Shkodra'' is the local version of RT in [[Shkod\u00ebr]]\n\n====Austria====\n{{Main|ORF (broadcaster)}}\n[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] (''\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk'') is the public broadcaster in Austria. Despite the fact that private broadcasting companies were allowed in Austria in the late 1990s, ORF is still ''the'' key player in the field. It has three nationwide radio channels ([[\u00d61]], [[\u00d63]], [[FM4]]), nine regional ones (one for each [[Bundesland (Austria)|Bundesland]]). Its TV portfolio includes two general interest channels ([[ORF 1]] and [[ORF 2]]), one cultural-instructional channel ([[ORF III]]), one Europe-wide version of ORF 2 and a sports channel ([[ORF Sport +]]). ORF also takes part in the German-language satellite TV network [[3sat]].\n\n====Belgium====\nBelgium has three networks, one for each linguistic community:\n* [[RTBF]], French-language, with 4 TV channels ([[La Une]], [[La Deux]], [[La Trois]] and [[Arte Belgique]]) and 6 radios.\n* [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], Dutch-language, with 3 TV channels and 10 radios.\n* [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]], German-language, with 1 TV channel and 2 radios.\n\nOriginally named INR\u2014''Institut national belge de radiodiffusion'' ({{lang-nl|NIR\u2014Belgisch Nationaal Instituut voor de Radio-omroep|links=no}})\u2014the state-owned broadcasting organization was established by law on 18 June 1930. Television broadcasting from Brussels began in 1953, with two hours of programming each day. In 1960 the INR was subsumed into RTB ({{lang-fr|Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge}}) and BRT ({{lang-nl|Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep}}).\n\nOn 1 October 1945 INR-NIR began to broadcast some programmes in German. In 1961 RTB-BRT began a German-language radio channel, broadcasting from [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nIn 1977, following Belgian [[federalism|federalization]] and the establishment of separate [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language communities]], the French-language section of RTB-BRT became RTBF ({{lang-fr|Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise|links=no}}), German-language section became [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] ({{lang-de|Belgischer Rundfunk|links=no}}) and Dutch-language stays BRT.\n\nBRT was renamed in 1991 to BRTN ({{lang-nl|Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep Nederlandstalige Uitzendingen|links=no}}) and again in 1998 to VRT ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie}}).\n\n====Bulgaria====\nThere are two public media in Bulgaria - the [[Bulgarian National Television]] (BNT) and the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] (BNR). [[Bulgarian National Television]] was founded in 1959 and the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] was founded in 1935. BNT broadcasts 4 national programs (BNT 1, BNT 2, BNT HD, BNT World).

The organisation was founded in 1925, on principles similar to those of the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. DR runs six nationwide television channels and eight radio channels. Financing comes primarily from a yearly licence fee, that everyone who owns either a television set, a computer or other devices that can access the internet, has to pay. A part of collected fees is also used to finance the network of [[TV 2 (Denmark)#Regions|regional public service stations]] operating under the brand of TV 2. [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] itself, however, is a commercial government-owned television funded by subscriptions and advertising, with particular public service duties such as allowing regional stations to air their newscasts within specific timeslots of the main TV 2 channel.\n\n====Faroe Islands====\n[[Kringvarp F\u00f8roya]] is the organisation in Faroe Islands with public service obligations. Formed in 1957 as a radio broadcaster [[\u00datvarp F\u00f8roya]]. Merged with Sj\u00f3nvarp F\u00f8roya TV station on 1 January 2007 to form [[Kringvarp F\u00f8roya]].

A fourth radio network was added in 1954 and a second television channel in 1963.\n\nRTF was transformed into the [[Office de radiodiffusion t\u00e9l\u00e9vision fran\u00e7aise]] (ORTF), a more independent structure, in 1964. ORTF oversaw the birth of a third television channel in 1972, two years before the dissolution of the structure in 1974. Between this date and 2000, each channel had its own direction structure. The first channel ([[TF1]]) was sold to the private sector in 1987. (At the time, the channel with the largest audience was the other public channel [[Antenne 2]]).\n\nIn 1986 a French/German public channel was created, [[Arte|ARTE]], originally broadcast on cable and satellite. Later, the fall of the private channel [[La Cinq]] freed some frequencies that it had used each day after 19.00. In 1994 a new public channel, [[France5|La cinqui\u00e8me]] was created to use the remaining time on the same frequencies. La cinqui\u00e8me and ARTE subsequently shared the same channels with the exception of satellite, cable, and internet channels where both could be broadcast all day long. In 2000 all the public channels were united into one structure, [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]].\n\n====Germany====\n{{See also|Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], when regional broadcasters had been merged into one national network by the [[Nazis]] to create a powerful means of [[propaganda]], [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] insisted on a de-centralised, independent structure for German public broadcasting and created regional public broadcasting agencies that, by and large, still exist today.\n[[File:ARD Karte.svg|thumb|Map of ARD-members]]\n\n* [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] ([[Lower Saxony]], [[Hamburg]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]), split from former NWDR\n* [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|RBB]] ([[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]]), merged from SFB and ORB\n* [[S\u00fcdwestrundfunk|SWR]] ([[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] and  [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), merged from SDR and SWF\n* [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] ([[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]]), established in 1991\n* [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]]), split from former NWDR\n* [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] ([[Bavaria]])\n* [[Hessischer Rundfunk|hr]] ([[Hesse]])\n* [[Saarl\u00e4ndischer Rundfunk|SR]] ([[Saarland]])\n* [[Radio Bremen|RB]] ([[Bremen (state)|Bremen]])\n\nIn addition to these nine regional radio and TV broadcasters, which cooperate within [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], a second national television service\u2014actually called Second German Television ({{lang-de|[[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]]}}, ZDF)\u2014was later created in 1961 and a national radio service with two networks ([[Deutschlandradio]]) emerged from the remains of [[Cold War]] propaganda stations in 1994.

The system is intended to reflect the diversity of all the groups composing the nation.\n\n====Nordic countries====\nNational public broadcasters in The Nordic countries were modeled after the BBC and established a decade later: Radioordningen (now [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]) in Denmark, Kringkastingselskapet (now [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]]) in Norway, and Radiotj\u00e4nst (now [[Sveriges Radio]] and [[Sveriges Television]]) in Sweden (all in 1925). In 1926 Yleisradio (Swedish: Rundradion) now [[Yle]] was founded in Finland. All four are funded from television licence fees costing (in 2007) around {{\u20ac|230}} ({{USD|300}}) per household per year.<!--Add Iceland here? Faroe Islands?-->\n\n====Poland====\nThe public broadcasters are [[Telewizja Polska]] (TVP) television and [[Polskie Radio]]. TVP operates three main channels: [[TVP 1]], [[TVP 2]] and [[TVP Regionalna]]. It also broadcasts several digital channels (including TVP&nbsp;1, TVP1 HD, TVP 2, TVP2 HD, [[TVP Info]], [[TVP Kultura]], [[TVP Historia]], [[TVP HD]], [[TVP Polonia]], [[TVP Sport]], [[TVP Seriale]]) via satellite and digital terrestrial television system, and 16 regional affiliates (known as TVP Regionalna, regional channels cooperate when creating most of materials). TVP also runs services with news, a video streaming (video on demand) service as well as live streaming of all its channels. [[Polskie Radio]] operates four nationwide radio channels (which are also available via the broadcaster's website). There are also 17 state-owned radio stations broadcasting in particular regions. TVP and Polish Radio are funded from several sources: state funding, advertising, obligatory tax on all TV and radio receivers, and money from authors/copyright associations. The public broadcasters offer a mix of commercial shows and programmes they are, by law, required to broadcast (i.e., [[non-commercial]], niche programmes; programmes for children; programmes promoting different points of view and diversity; programmes for different religious and national groups; live coverage of the parliament's session on its dedicated channel: TVP Parlament; etc.). It has to be politically neutral, although in the past there have been cases of political pressure on TVP and Polskie Radio from the governing party. Recently, a new law has been passed by the ruling Law & Justice party, that in public perception allowed the party to take a much larger control over the media that has been possible before. The party states this law to be the first step to a complete public media overdo. Many worry no such improvements are actually coming and that these recent laws are only another step in taking control over the whole country by the Law & Justice party.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate in Poland about the semi-commercial nature of TVP and PR. Many people fear that making them into totally non-commercial broadcasters would result in the licence fee payable by households being increased, and fewer people being interested in programmes they offer; others say that TVP in particular is too profit-driven and should concentrate on programming that benefits the society.\n\n====Portugal====\n{{Main|R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal}}\n[[File:R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal.svg|thumb|RTP brand]]\nIn Portugal, the national public broadcaster is [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal]] (RTP), which in 1957 began regular broadcasts of its first channel, now [[RTP1]]. In 1968 its second channel appeared, then called \"''segundo programa''\", now [[RTP2]]. In the 1970s, TV arrived in the Portuguese islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], with the creation of two regional channels: [[RTP Madeira]] in 1972 and [[RTP A\u00e7ores]] in 1976.\n\nUntil the 1990s the state had a monopoly on TV broadcasting, so RTP1 and RTP2 were the only Portuguese channels, both with similar [[generalist channel|generalist programmes]]. In 1990, RTP1 was renamed \"Canal&nbsp;1\", and in 1992 RTP2 was renamed \"TV2\". With the creation of the two private channels, [[Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o|SIC]] in 1992 and [[Televis\u00e3o Independente]] in 1993, the philosophy of the public service changed: in 1995, ''TV2'' was again renamed RTP2 and became an alternative channel dedicated to culture, science, arts, documentaries, sports (except football), minorities and children. Since then, RTP2 has carried no advertising. Canal&nbsp;1, renamed back RTP1 also in 1995, remained the commercial channel of RTP group, focused on entertainment, information and major sport competitions. In 2004, after a great restructuring period, RTP started its current branding. That year the two thematic channels of the group were also created\u2014RTPN, a 24 hour-news channel which became RTP Informa\u00e7\u00e3o in 2011 and [[RTP3]] in 2015; and [[RTP Mem\u00f3ria]], dedicated to classic RTP programming. In 2014 the headquarters of RTP2 were transferred from [[Lisbon]] to [[Porto]].\n\nThe group also has two international channels: [[RTP Internacional]], founded in 1992 and dedicated to Europe, Asia and Americas, and [[RTP \u00c1frica]], founded in 1998 focused on Africa, mainly the [[CPLP]] countries of [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]] and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]].\n\nThe RTP group is financed by the advertising revenues from RTP1, RTP Informa\u00e7\u00e3o, RTP Mem\u00f3ria, RTP \u00c1frica, and RTP Internacional, and also by the ''taxa de contribui\u00e7\u00e3o audiovisual'' (broadcasting contribution tax), which is incorporated in electricity bills. Funding from the government budget ceased in 2014, during the [[2010\u201314 Portuguese financial crisis|Portuguese financial crisis]].\n\n====Romania====\n[[Romanian Television]] (TVR) is the national public TV broadcaster in Romania. It operates five channels: [[TVR1]], [[TVR2]], [[TVR3]], [[TVRi]], and [[TVR HD]], along with six regional studios in [[TVR Bucure\u0219ti|Bucharest]], [[TVR Cluj|Cluj-Napoca]], [[TVR Ia\u0219i|Ia\u0219i]], [[TVR Timi\u0219oara|Timi\u0219oara]], [[TVR Craiova|Craiova]], and [[TVR T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219|T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]].\n\nThe public radio broadcaster is [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]] (Radio Romania). It operates [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[AM broadcasting|AM]], and [[webcast|internet]] national, regional, and local radio channels. The regional and local stations are branded as [[Radio Rom\u00e2nia Regional]]. Broadcasting in 12 languages, [[Radio Romania International]] is the company's international radio station.\n\nTVR and Radio Romania are funded through a hybrid financing system, drawing from the state budget, a special tax (incorporated in electricity bills), and advertising too.\n\n====Serbia====\n[[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) is the national public broadcaster in [[Serbia]]. It operates a total of five television channels (RTS1, RTS2, RTS Digital, RTS HD and RTS SAT) and five radio stations (Radio Belgrade&nbsp;1, Radio Belgrade&nbsp;2, Radio Belgrade&nbsp;3, Radio Belgrade 202, and Stereorama). RTS is primarily funded through public television licence fees bundled with electricity bills paid monthly, as well as [[advertising]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=06&dd=25&nav_id=80948|title=Consumer protection group wants TV fees abolished|work=B92|accessdate=October 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083435/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=06&dd=25&nav_id=80948|archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Slovakia====\n\n[[Radio and Television Slovakia]] (RTVS) is the national public broadcaster in [[Slovakia]], with headquarters in [[Bratislava]]. This organisation was created in 2011 by merger of Slovak Television and Slovak Radio. RTVS broadcasts two television channels (STV1, STV2), five FM radio stations (R\u00e1dio Slovensko, R\u00e1dio Dev\u00edn, R\u00e1dio Regina, R\u00e1dio_FM and R\u00e1dio Patria), one satellite radio channel ([[Radio Slovakia International]]) and three digital only radio stations (R\u00e1dio Klasika, R\u00e1dio Litera and R\u00e1dio Junior). RTVS is funded through monthly fee of \u20ac4.64, which every household with electricity connection must pay. The director of RTVS is V\u00e1clav Mika. RTVS is a full member of [[European broadcasting union]].\n\n====Spain====\nIn Spain, being a highly decentralised country, two public broadcasting systems coexist: a national broadcasting television, [[RTVE|Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]] (RTVE), that can be watched all around Spain, and many autonomic TV channels, only broadcast within their respective [[Autonomous Community]]. Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola was founded in 1956, during Franco's dictatorship. It broadcasts two different TV-channels: [[TVE1]] (a.k.a. ''La Primera'' or ''La uno''), that is a wide-range audience general channel; and [[TVE2]], (a.k.a. ''La dos''), that tends to offer cultural programing, as well as sport competitions. Till 2008, RTVE was funded both from public sources and private advertising; however, the Spanish government has recently decreed that, starting in September 2009, RTVE's channels shall be funded with taxpayer's money and with private founding raised from the rest of Spain's private TV stations, thus removing advertising from the broadcaster. A TV licence fee has been suggested, but with little popular success.\n\nMoreover, each of the [[autonomous communities]] of Spain have their own public broadcaster, all of them members of [[FORTA]], usually consisting in either one or two public channels that tend to reproduce the model set up by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola: a general channel and a more cultural related one. In the Autonomous Communities that have their own official language besides Spanish, those channels may broadcast not in Spanish, but in the other co-official language. For example, this occurs in [[Catalonia]], where [[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]] broadcasts mainly in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. In the [[Valencian Community]], [[CVMC]] broadcasts a TV channnel and a radio network, both branded as \u00c0 Punt<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apuntmedia.es|title=\u00c0 Punt M\u00e8dia|last=|first=|date=|website=\u00c0 Punt M\u00e8dia, the public valencian media|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and mainly broadcast on [[Valencian]]. In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Euskal Telebista]] (ETB) has three channels, two of which broadcast only in [[Basque language|basque]] ([[ETB 1]] and [[ETB 3]]), whereas the other ([[ETB 2]]) broadcasts in Spanish. In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Television de Galicia]] and the [[Television de Galicia|G2]]. All the autonomic networks are publicly funded, and also admit private advertising.\n\n====Sweden====\n[[File:SVT 2016.svg|upright|thumb|The logo of SVT]]\n[[File:Sveriges-Radio-Logo.svg|thumb|The logo of Sveriges Radio]]\nSweden has three public service broadcasters, namely [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT), [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] (UR), and [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), having previously had government monopoly. SVT is the national public television broadcaster with 4 channels (SVT 1, SVT 2, SVT Barnkanalen, and SVT 24). The aim is to make programs for everybody. For example, Sweden has the historic [[Sami people|Sami]] minority and SVT make programs in their language for them to watch. There are also a Finnish minority in Sweden, thus SVT show news in Finnish on [[SVT Uutiset]]. SR is the radio equivalent of SVT, with channels P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and the Finnish channel SR Sisuradio.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{main|Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom}}\nThe United Kingdom has a strong tradition of public service broadcasting. In addition to the [[BBC]], established in 1922, there is also [[Channel 4]], a publicly owned, commercially funded public service broadcaster, and [[S4C]], a Welsh-language broadcaster in Wales. Furthermore, the two commercial broadcasters [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also have significant public service obligations imposed as part of their licence to broadcast.\n\nIn the UK there are also small community broadcasters. There are now 228 stations with FM broadcast licences (licensed by [[Ofcom]]). Community radio stations typically cover a small geographical area with a coverage radius of up to 5&nbsp;km and run on a nonprofit basis. They can cater for whole communities or for different areas of interest\u2014such as a particular ethnic group, age group or interest group. Community radio stations reflect a diverse mix of cultures and interests. For example, you can listen to stations catering to urban or experimental music, while others are aimed at younger people, religious communities or the armed forces and their families.\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nIn Australia, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) is owned by the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] and is 100% taxpayer funded. The multicultural [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS), another public broadcaster, now accepts limited sponsorship and advertising.\n\nIn addition, there is a large Australian [[community radio]] sector, funded in part by federal grants via the Community Broadcasting Foundation, but largely sustained via subscriptions, donations and business sponsorship. As of February 2020, there are 450+ fully licensed community radio stations <ref>https://www.cbaa.org.au/about/about-community-broadcasting</ref> and a number of [[community television]] stations (most operating as [[Channel 31 (Australia)|Channel 31]] despite being unrelated across different states). They are organised similarly to PBS and NPR stations in the United States, and take on the role that [[public access television]] stations have in the US.\n\n====New Zealand====\nIn New Zealand all broadcasters are given a small slice of public broadcasting responsibility, because of the state-funded agency [[NZ On Air]]. This is because of NZ On Air's requirement for public-service programmes across all channels and stations, instead of being put into one single network. The former public broadcaster BCNZ (formerly NZBC \u2013 [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]]) was broken up into separate state-owned corporations, [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ) and [[Radio New Zealand]] (RNZ). While RNZ remains commercial-free, about 90% of funding for TVNZ comes from selling advertising during programmes on their two stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/823782|title=The TVNZ Charter|accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref><ref name=\"Te Ara\">{{cite web |last1=McMillan |first1=Kate |title=Media and politics - Ownership and Regulation |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/media-and-politics/page-2 |publisher=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref> TVNZ continues to be a public broadcaster; however like [[CBC Television]] in Canada it is essentially a fully commercial network in continuous ratings battles with other stations, which continues to be a [[TVNZ#Controversies|controversial issue]] within New Zealand. With the shutdown of TVNZ&nbsp;7, the only fully non-commercial public-service network in New Zealand is [[Radio New Zealand]].\n\nAside from television, New Zealand has a rich public radio culture, [[Radio New Zealand]] being the main provider, with a varied network ([[Radio New Zealand National]]) and a classical musical network ([[Radio New Zealand Concert]]). RNZ also provides the Pacific with its [[Radio New Zealand International]]. Aside from RNZ almost all of [[Regions of New Zealand|New Zealand's 16 regions]] has an \"[[Association of Community Access Broadcasters|access radio]]\" network. All these networks are commercial-free.<ref name=\"Te Ara\" />\n\nIn late January 2020, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]] announced that they were planning

English musical duo|Public Service Broadcasting (band)|the American television channel|PBS}}\n'''Public broadcasting''' involves [[radio]], [[television]] and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is [[public service]]. In many countries of the world, [[government funding|funding]] comes from governments, especially via annual [[Broadcasting license fee | fee]]s charged on receivers. In the [[United States]], public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and [[business]]es (ranging from small shops to corporations), along with audience contributions via [[pledge drive]]s. The great majority operate as private [[not-for-profit corporation]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nPublic broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated, depending on the country and the station. In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting. Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages. Historically, public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries (with the notable exception of the United States). [[Commercial broadcasting]] now also exists in most of these countries; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date= August 2011}}\n\n==Definition==\nThe primary mission of public broadcasting is that of public service, speaking to and engaging as a citizen.<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting \u2013 Why, How?|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001240/124058eo.pdf|publisher=UNESCO & World Radio and Television Council|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> The British model has been widely accepted as a universal definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nosuch-research.co.uk/pppp.html|title=BRU definition of public service broadcasting|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=raboy>{{cite book|last=Raboy|first=Marc|title=Public broadcasting for the 21st century|year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=1-86020-006-0|pages=6\u201310}}</ref><ref name=psbGlobal>{{cite book|last=Banerjee|first=Indrajit|title=Public service broadcasting in the age of globalization|year=2006|publisher=Asian Media Information and Communication Centre (AMIC)|isbn=981-4136-01-8}}</ref> The model embodies the following principles:\n\n* Universal geographic accessibility\n* Universal appeal\n* Attention to minorities\n* Contribution to national identity and sense of community\n* Distance from vested interests\n* Direct funding and universality of payment\n* Competition in good programming rather than numbers\n* Guidelines that liberate rather than restrict\n\nWhile application of certain principles may be straightforward, as in the case of accessibility, some of the principles may be poorly defined or difficult to implement. In the context of a shifting national identity, the role of public broadcasting may be unclear. Likewise, the subjective nature of good programming may raise the question of individual or public taste.<ref name=raboy/>\n\nWithin public broadcasting there are two different views regarding commercial activity. One is that public broadcasting is incompatible with commercial objectives. The other is that public broadcasting can and should compete in the marketplace with commercial broadcasters. This dichotomy is highlighted by the public service aspects of traditional commercial broadcasters.<ref name=raboy/>\n\nPublic broadcasters in each jurisdiction may or may not be synonymous with government controlled broadcasters. In some countries like the UK public broadcasters are not sanctioned by government departments and have independent means of funding, and thus enjoy editorial independence.\n\n==Technology==\nPublic broadcasting utilizes [[radio]], [[television]], and [[internet]] technologies.\n===Radio===\n[[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio are used for public broadcasting.\n\n==Economics==\nPublic broadcasters may receive their funding from an obligatory [[television licence]] fee, individual contributions, government funding or commercial sources. Public broadcasters do not rely on advertising to the same degree as commercial broadcasters, or at all; this allows public broadcasters to transmit programmes that are not commercially viable to the [[mass market]], such as [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] shows, [[radio documentary|radio]] and [[documentary film|television documentaries]], and [[educational programme]]s.\n\nOne of the principles of public broadcasting is to provide coverage of interests for which there are missing or small markets. Public broadcasting attempts to supply topics of social benefit that are otherwise not provided by commercial broadcasters. Typically, such underprovision is argued to exist when the benefits to viewers are relatively high in comparison to the benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers.<ref name=andcoate /> This frequently is the case in undeveloped countries that normally have low benefits to advertising.<ref name=andcoate>{{cite journal|author1=Simon P. Anderson|author2=Stephen Coate|title=Market Provision of Broadcasting: A Welfare Analysis|journal=[[The Review of Economic Studies]]|date=October 2005|volume=72|issue=4|pages=947\u2013972 |doi=10.1111/0034-6527.00357 }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural policy==\nAdditionally, public broadcasting may facilitate the implementation of a [[cultural policy]] (an [[industrial policy]] and [[investment policy]] for culture). Examples include:\n\n*The Canadian government is committed to [[Canadian official bilingualism|official bilingualism]] (English and French). As a result, the public broadcaster, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] employs translators and journalists who speak both official languages and it encourages production of cross-cultural material.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} \n*In the UK, the [[BBC]] supports multiculturalism and diversity, in part by using on-screen commentators and hosts of different ethnic origins. There are also [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Irish and Scottish Gaelic language programmes for the home nations, an Asian Network broadcasting in English and five major languages of South Asia, and the BBC World Service broadcasts in 31 international languages, also funded independently of government.\n*In New Zealand, the public broadcasting system provides support to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] broadcasting, with the stated intention of improving their opportunities, maintaining their cultural heritage and promoting their language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n*In Australia, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] is legally required to 'encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia' and 'broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity' with specific emphasis on regional and rural Australia'.<ref>Charter of the Corporation (ABC). [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/ABCcharter.htm Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983: Section 6].</ref> Furthermore, the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) is intended to reflect the spirit and sense of multicultural richness and the unique international cultural values within Australian society.\n\n==Worldwide==\nThe model, established in the 1920s, of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]\u2014an organization widely trusted, even by citizens of the [[Axis Powers]]{{according to whom|date=March 2020}} during World War II\u2014was widely emulated throughout Europe, the [[British Empire]], and later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The public broadcasters in a number of countries are basically an application of the model used in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nModern public broadcasting is often a mixed commercial model. For example, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] is funded by advertising revenue supplemented by a government subsidy to support its television service.\n\n===Americas===\n\n====Argentina====\nState presence in television had a strong history, not in the way of European style public service radio or television.\nThe private sector has taken an active role in the development of television in Buenos Aires. In opposition, state broadcasters tend to be federal and technical innovative, such as the\n[[Televisi\u00f3n P\u00fablica Argentina]], the first national TV station, 68 years old.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn Brazil, the two main national public broadcasters are EBC ([[Empresa Brasil de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o]], Brazil Communication Company) and the [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta]] (Padre Anchieta Foundation). The EBC was created in 2007 to manage the Brazilian federal government's radio and television stations. EBC owns broadcast networks such as [[TV Brasil]] (launched in 2007, being the merger of [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s TV Educativa (1975\u20132007) and [[Bras\u00edlia]]'s TV Nacional (1960\u20132007), and the stations [[R\u00e1dio Nacional|Nacional]] and Radio MEC in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro. The Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta was created by the government of the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1967 and includes a television station ([[TV Cultura]], launched in 1969 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]), and two radio stations (R\u00e1dio Cultura FM and R\u00e1dio Cultura Brasil). The Padre Anchieta Foundation is a privately held company which maintains autonomy. \n\nMany Brazilian states also have regional public radio and television stations, all of them members of the Brazilian Association of Public, Educational and Cultural Broadcasters (ABEPEC). This is the case of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], which has the ''Empresa Mineira de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o'' (EMC, Minas Gerais Communication Company), a public company created in 2016, formed by [[Rede Minas]], the public television channel and the two stations of [[R\u00e1dio Inconfid\u00eancia]] (which also broadcasts in [[shortwave]]). The state of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] also has its own public radio (''R\u00e1dio Esp\u00edrito Santo'') and television (''Televis\u00e3o Educativa do Esp\u00edrito Santo - TVE-ES'', Educational Television of Esp\u00edrito Santo). In [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the public television station is the TVE-RS (Televis\u00e3o Educativa do Rio Grande do Sul, Educational Television of Rio Grande do Sul) and a radio station (FM Cultura). The regional public television channels in Brazil are affiliates and broadcast part of TV Brasil or TV Cultura programming.\n\nCurrently, EBC undergoes several critics by some conservative politicians for having a supposed left-leaning bias. The current president of Brazil, [[Jair Bolsonaro]], intends to extinguish the EBC.<ref>https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/promessa-de-campanha-ebc-sera-extinta-afirma-bolsonaro-23708282</ref><ref>https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/2019-05-31/em-entrevista-bolsonaro-diz-que-extincao-da-ebc-esta-decidida.html</ref>\n\n====Canada====\n{{see also|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}\nIn Canada, the main public broadcaster is the national [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC; {{lang-fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada}}), a [[state-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] \u2013 which originated as a radio network in November 1936. It is the successor to the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC), which was established by the administration of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R.B. Bennett]] in 1932, modeled on recommendations made in 1929 by the [[Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting]] and stemming from lobbying efforts by the [[Canadian Radio League]]. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation took over operation of the CRBC's nine radio stations (which were largely concentrated in major cities across Canada, including [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]]). The CBC eventually expanded to television in September 1952 with the sign-on of [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]] in Montreal, the first television station in Canada to initiate full-time broadcasts, which initially served as a primary affiliate of the French language T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada and a secondary affiliate of the [[Canadian English|English language]] CBC Television service.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Birth and Death of The Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (1932-1936)|url=https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/birth-and-death-canadian-radio-broadcasting-commission-1932-1936|website=[[Canadian Communications Foundation]]|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCBC operates two national television networks ([[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]]), four radio networks ([[CBC Radio One]], [[CBC Radio 2]], [[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]] and [[Ici Musique]]) and several cable television channels including two 24-hour news channels ([[CBC News Network]] and [[Ici RDI]]) in both of Canada's official languages \u2013 English and French \u2013 and the French-language channels [[Ici Explora]] and [[Ici ARTV]], dedicated to science and culture respectively. CBC's national television operations and some radio operations are funded partly by advertisements, in addition to the subsidy provided by the federal government. The cable channels are commercial entities owned and operated by the CBC and do not receive any direct public funds, however, they do benefit from synergies with resources from the other CBC operations. The CBC has frequently dealt with budget cuts and labour disputes, often resulting in a debate about whether the service has the resources necessary to properly fulfill its mandate.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, all of CBC Television's terrestrial stations are [[owned-and-operated station|owned and operated]] by the CBC directly. The number of privately owned CBC Television affiliates has gradually declined in recent years, as the network has moved its programming to stations opened by the corporation or has purchased certain affiliates from private broadcasting groups; budgetary issues led the CBC to choose not to launch new rebroadcast transmitters in markets where the network disaffiliated from a private station after 2006; the network dropped its remaining private affiliates in 2016, when [[CJDC-TV]]/[[Dawson Creek]] and [[CFTK-TV]]/[[Terrace, British Columbia]] defected from CBC Television that February and [[Lloydminster]]-based [[CKSA-DT]] disaffiliated in August of that year (to become affiliates of [[CTV Two]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]], respectively). The CBC's decision to disaffiliate from these and other privately owned stations, as well as the corporation decommissioning its network of rebroadcasters following [[Digital terrestrial television in Canada|Canada's transition to digital television]] in August 2011 have significantly reduced the terrestrial coverage of both CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9; the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) does require cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry CBC and Radio-Canada stations as part of their basic tier, regardless of terrestrial availability in an individual market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadcast Distribution Regulations (ss. 17(d) and 17(f))|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-97-555/FullText.html#s-17|website=Justice Laws Website|publisher=[[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]]|date=February 28, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Of the three major French-language television networks in Canada, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9 is the only one that maintains terrestrial owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in all ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], although it maintains only one station ([[Moncton, New Brunswick]]-based [[CBAFT-DT]]) that serves the four provinces comprising [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nIn recent years, the CBC has also expanded into [[new media]] ventures including the online radio service [[CBC Radio 3]], [[music streaming]] service [[CBC Music]], and the launch of online news services, such as [[CBC Hamilton]], in some markets which are not directly served by their own CBC television or radio stations.\n\nIn addition, several provinces operate public broadcasters; these are not CBC subentities, but distinct networks in their own right. Most of the provincial services maintain an educational programming format, differing from the primarily entertainment-based CBC/Radio-Canada operations, but more closely formatted to (and carrying many of the same programs as) the U.S.-based [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), which itself is available terrestrially and \u2013 under a CRTC rule that requires Canadian cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry affiliates of the four major U.S. commercial networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) and a PBS member station<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian cablecos to do the FOX trot.|newspaper=Alberta Report / Newsmagazine|page=43|date=September 12, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Canada-U.S. cross-border station shake-up|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canada-cross-border-station-shake-87165|author=Etan Vlessing|agency=Associated Press|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Holdings|The Nielsen Company]]|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> \u2013 through pay television providers in Canada via member stations located near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Canada border]]. These educational public broadcasters include the English-language [[TVOntario]] (TVO) and the French-language [[TFO]] in [[Ontario]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]] in [[Quebec]], and [[Knowledge Network]] in [[British Columbia]]. TVO and T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec operate through conventional transmitters and cable, while TFO and Knowledge Network are cable-only channels. Beyond these and other provincial services, Canada does not have a national public educational network.\n\n[[File:CJAI-islandradio-summer2010.jpg|thumb|right|Amherst Island public radio]]\nCanada is also home to a number of former public broadcasting entities that have gone private. [[CTV Two Alberta]], which is licensed as an educational television station in Alberta, was once owned by the [[Government of Alberta|Alberta government]] as the public broadcaster Access. In 1993, the provincial government agreed to cease to direct funding of Access after the 1994 fiscal year; the channel was sold to [[CHUM Limited]] in 1995, which initially acquired the channel through a majority-owned subsidiary, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Limited (LSTA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1995/DB95-472.HTM|title=Decision CRTC 95-472|publisher=CRTC|date=1995-07-20|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> To fulfill its license conditions as an educational station, it broadcasts educational and children's programming during the [[daytime television|daytime]] hours, while airing entertainment programming favoured by advertisers and viewers in prime time. The service discontinued its broadcast transmitters in [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] in August 2011, due to the expense of transitioning the two stations to [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]], and the fact that the service had mandatory carriage on television providers serving Alberta regardless of whether it ran over-the-air transmitters. The service has since operated as part of [[Bell Media]]'s [[CTV Two]] chain of stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201012616|title=Applicant response dated 6 December 2010|accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref>\n\nPublic radio station [[CKUA Radio Network|CKUA]] in Alberta was also formerly operated by Access, before being sold to the [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] CKUA Radio Foundation which continues to operate it as a community-funded radio network. [[CJRT-FM]] in Toronto also operated as a public government-owned radio station for many years; while no longer funded by the provincial government, it still solicits most of its budget from listener and corporate donations and is permitted to air only a very small amount of commercial advertising.\n\n[[City Saskatchewan]] originated as the Saskatchewan Communications Network, a cable-only educational and cultural public broadcaster owned by the [[government of Saskatchewan]]. SCN was sold to Bluepoint Investment Corporation in 2010, and like CTV Two Alberta did when it became privatized, incorporated a limited schedule of entertainment programming during the late afternoon and nighttime hours, while retaining educational and children's programs during the morning until mid-afternoon to fulfill its licensing conditions; Bluepoint later sold the channel to [[Rogers Media]] in 2012, expanding a relationship it began with SCN in January of that year, when Rogers began supplying entertainment programming to the channel through an affiliation agreement with its English-language broadcast network, [[City (TV network)|Citytv]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2010/06/21/sk-scn-sale-1006.html Sask.

In addition, cable companies are required to produce a local [[Community channel (Canada)|community channel]] in each licensed market. Such channels have traditionally aired community talk shows, city council meetings and other locally oriented programming, although it is becoming increasingly common for them to adopt the format and branding of a local news channel.\n\nCanada also has a large number of [[campus radio]] and [[community radio]] stations.\n\n====Colombia====\n[[Colombia]] had between 1955 and 1998 a public television system very similar to that adopted by the NPO in the Netherlands, where private television producers called \"''[[programadora]]s''\" were given hours on the country's two public television channels ([[Canal 1 (Colombia)|Cadena Uno]] and [[Canal A]]). In 1998, when the Colombian government allowed the opening of television to the private market by granting two broadcast licenses to the ''programadoras'' Caracol Televisi\u00f3n and RCN Televisi\u00f3n, these television producers went into crisis, causing many to end their activities or produce content for the private television channels. Currently, Colombia has three public channels (one is operated by a private company formed by the shares of four former ''programadoras'') and eight public radio stations (three stations are regional broadcasters).\n\n====Chile====\nChilean television was founded through universities, in an attempt to bring public television without the state having to pay directly and control content. The University of Chile (owner of the former Channels&nbsp;9 and 11 until 1993), the Catholic University of Chile on channels 2 and 13 until 2010, and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso]] on channels&nbsp;8 and 4. Channel&nbsp;8, in [[Valpara\u00edso]], is the first and oldest station on Chile, transmitting since October 5, 1957. As soon as 1961 universities began transmitting advertisements between their programs, the first of them being the channel&nbsp;9, showing a Motorola TV set. This kind of disguised advertising took the name of \"Payola\". This situation, added to the fact that TV was only reaching [[Santiago]] and [[Valpara\u00edso]], led to the creation of a state network that should serve the whole country. This network, created in 1964 and in operation since October 24, 1969, is known as \"[[Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile]]\". After the military government of [[Augusto Pinochet]], television was mostly deregulated. Thus, two new commercial channels were born: Megavisi\u00f3n (Channel&nbsp;9, on October 23, 1990) and La Red (Channel&nbsp;4, on May 12, 1991). The University of Chile's channel&nbsp;11 also was rented to a private operator on October 1, 1993 and is today known today as \"Chilevisi\u00f3n\".\n\nTelevisi\u00f3n Nacional, popularly known as channel 7 because of its [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] frequency, is governed by a seven-member board appointed by both the [[President of Chile|President]] and [[Chilean Senate|the Senate]]. It is meant to be independent of political pressures, although accusations of bias have been made, especially during election campaigns.\n\n====Ecuador====\n[[Ecuador TV]] is the public service channel of Ecuador, established in October 2007. The channel was established at the same time as the installation of the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] so that the sessions could be transmitted live to all the country.\n\n==== El Salvador ====\nSalvadoran broadcasting has a public service radio and television channel. On March 1, 1926 began the operation as the first Central American broadcasting network called \"[[Radio Nacional de El Salvador]]\" with a frequency of 96.9 FM MHz founded by the president of that era, [[Alfonso Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez Molina]]. On November 4, 1964 the Government of El Salvador founded [[TVES (El Salvador)|Televisi\u00f3n de El Salvador]] as an educational television with the channels 8 and 10. And since 1989, Channel 10 turned as the channel of \"Televisi\u00f3n de El Salvador\" as the only public television service in El Salvador.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nIn Mexico, public stations were operated by state governments, universities and agencies of the state government, and five national public channels were founded. [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Canal Once]] was owned, and operated by a Mexican institution of higher education since March 2, 1959 as the first public broadcasting television in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canalonce.mx/sobre-canal-once/|title=El Once y su historia|access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> The [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|government of Mexico]] implemented [[Telesecundaria]] in 1968 to provide [[secondary education]] to students in rural areas through broadcast television channels, such as [[XHGC-TV]] in Mexico City. With the launching of the [[Morelos II]] satellite, Telesecundaria began transmitting on one of its analog channels in 1988; in 1994 it began broadcasting in digital format with the advent of the Solidaridad I satellite, and [[Televisi\u00f3n Educativa (Mexico)|Edusat]] was born and began transmitting in Mexico, [[Central America]] and certain regions of the [[United States]]. In 1982, [[XEIMT-TDT|Canal 22]] was founded and began operations eleven years later by the [[Secretariat of Culture]] as part of the \"[[RED M\u00e9xico]]\". In 2005 the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM in Spanish) began transmissions as the sister channel of [[XEUN-AM]] and [[XEUN-FM]] (both radio stations founded in 1959), [[TV UNAM]] which is part of the university and cultural diffusion. [[Canal Catorce]] was operated by the [[Sistema P\u00fablico de Radiodifusi\u00f3n del Estado Mexicano]] (SPR) in 2012 as a part of \"[[La Red de Radiodifusoras y Televisoras Educativas y Culturales de M\u00e9xico|RED M\u00e9xico]]\".\n\n====United States====\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n{{main|Public broadcasting in the United States}}\n{{See also|Corporation for Public Broadcasting}}\n\n[[File:UIUC Gregory Hall 200511.jpg|thumb|upright|The Gregory Hall on the campus of [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] hosted an important meeting of the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] in the 1940s, that spawned both [[PBS]] and [[NPR]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}]]\n\nEarly public stations were operated by state colleges and universities, and were often run as part of the schools' [[cooperative extension service]]s.

This network replaced the Ford Foundation-backed [[National Educational Radio Network]].

In addition, the Radiodifusi\u00f3n Nacional de Uruguay is a network of radios with 4 different stations in AM and FM that cover the whole country.\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Afghanistan====\n[[Radio Television Afghanistan]] (RTA) is the public broadcaster of Afghanistan and dates back to 1925.\n\n====Bangladesh====\nThe Bengali primary state television broadcaster is [[Bangladesh Television]] which also broadcasts worldwide through its satellite based branch, [[BTV World]]. There are also terrestrial state run TV channels: [[Sangsad TV]] owned and operated by [[Bengali parliament]] that covers the proceedings of the Parliament.\nThe [[Bangladesh Betar]] (BB) is the country's sole state radio broadcaster. Radio transmission in the region now forming Bangladesh started in Dhaka on December 16, 1939. The [[Ministry of Information (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Information]] is responsible for the administration of all government TV channels and Radio.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:RTHK.jpg|thumb|Broadcasting House, the longtime headquarters of RTHK]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Radio Television Hong Kong ([[RTHK]]) is the sole public service broadcaster. Although a government department under administrative hierarchy, it enjoys [[editorial independence]]. It operates seven radio channels, and produces television programmes and broadcast on commercial television channels, as these channels are required by law to provide time slot for RTHK television programmes. RTHK would be assigned a digital terrestrial television channel within 2013 to 2015.\n\n====India====\nIn India, [[Prasar Bharati]] is India's public broadcaster. However it does have commercial advertising on it. It is an autonomous corporation of the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)]], Government of India and comprises the [[Doordarshan]] television network and [[All India Radio]]. Prasar Bharati was established on 23 November 1997, following a demand that the government owned broadcasters in India should be given autonomy like those in many other countries. The Parliament of India passed an Act to grant this autonomy in 1990, but it was not enacted until 15 September 1997.\n\n==== Israel ====\nIn Israel, the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|Israeli Broadcasting Authority]] was the country's main public broadcasting service until 2017.\n\nAs of May 15, 2017, it was replaced by '''[[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|KAN]]''' (Hebrew for \"here\"), the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nIn Arabic, the IPBC is known by the name '''MAKAN''' (Arabic for \"place\").\n\nKAN has inherited the two main public TV channels in Israel:\n* [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]], as of 2017 \"'''[[KAN 11]]'''\" - Main TV channel\n* [[Channel 33 (Israel)]], as of 2017 \"'''MAKAN 33'''\" - Arabic language TV channel\nKAN also includes the following 8 public radio stations, taken from IBA:\n* Reshet Alef (Network A), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Tarbut'''\" - Podcasts and talk programs related to culture\n* Reshet Bet (Network B), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Bet'''\" - News and current affairs\n* Reshet Gimel (Network C), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Gimel'''\" - Israeli music\n* Reshet Dalet (Network D), as of 2017 \"'''MAKAN Radio'''\" - Arabic language station\n* Reshet Hey (Network E), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Farsi'''\" - Persian language station, internet only\n* 88FM, as of 2017 \"'''KAN 88'''\" - Alternative music\n* Kol Hamusika (\"The Sound of Music\"), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Kol Hamusika'''\" - Classical music, jazz\n* REKA - Reshet Klitat [[Aliyah]] (Aliyah integration network), as of 2017 \"'''KAN Reka'''\" - Multilingual, mostly Russian language station\n* Reshet Moreshet, as of 2017 \"'''KAN Moreshet'''\" - Jewish-related news and programming\n\nThe [[Israeli Defense Forces]] owns its own broadcasting network known as IDF Waves which includes 2 radio stations: \n* IDF Waves ([[Galey Tzahal]]) - broadcasting news and current affairs\n* [[Galgalatz]] - broadcasting music and traffic reports\nIn addition, the ministry of education owns the [[Israeli Educational Television]], known as '''Hinuchit''', the first Israeli television channel. It was created by the Rothschild fund to aid the ministry's work in teaching children from kindergarten to high school and to promote the television's use in Israel at a time the government considered the device a \"cultural decadence\". It is funded and operated by the ministry, and since the 1980s it has widened its orientation to adults as well as children. In August 2018, the Educational Television will be shut down and replaced by '''KAN Hinuchit'''.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, the main public broadcaster is the [[NHK]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). The broadcaster was set up in 1926 and was modelled on the [[British Broadcasting Company]], the precursor to the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] created in 1927. Much like the BBC, NHK is funded by a \"receiving fee\" from every Japanese household, with no commercial advertising and the maintenance of a position of strict political impartiality. However, rampant non-payment by a large amount of households has led the receiving fee to become something of a political issue. NHK runs two national terrestrial TV stations (NHK General and NHK Educational) and two [[satellite]] only services (NHK BS1 and NHK BS Premium services). NHK also runs 3 national radio services and a number of international radio and television services, akin to the [[BBC World Service]]. NHK has also been an innovator in television, developing the world's first [[High definition TV|high definition television]] technology in 1964 and launching high definition services in Japan in 1981.\n\n====Macau====\nIn [[Macau]], Teledifus\u00e3o de Macau [[Teledifus\u00e3o de Macau|TDM]] is the public service broadcasting company. The firm was established in January 1982 and was modelled on R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]]. TDM has two independent editorial arms: the Chinese news channel and the Portuguese news channel, each of which may have different information sources, points of view, and priorities of news. TDM runs both television and radio services.\n\n====Malaysia====\nThe public broadcaster in Malaysia is the state-owned [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] (RTM). RTM was previously funded publicly through money obtained from [[Television licence|television licensing]], however it is currently state-subsidised, as television licences have been abolished.\n\n{{As of|2017}} RTM operates 8 national, 16 state and 7 district radio stations as well as 2 national terrestrial television channels called [[TV1 (Malaysia)|TV1]] and [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]]. RTM has also done test transmissions on a new digital television channel called [[RTMi]]. Tests involving 2000 residential homes in the [[Klang Valley]] began in September 2006 and ended in March 2007.\n\n====Nepal====\nHistory of public broadcasting in Nepal started from 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AS_RFm-BmeZtZGc2ejdwbWJfNGdycmNjemdt&hl=en|title= Public Service Broadcasting in Nepal|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn Pakistan, the public broadcasters are the state-owned [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] (PBC), also known as Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television. In the past Radio Pakistan was partly funded  through money obtained from License fees. In 1999, the Nawaz Sharif government abolished license fees for Radio Pakistan and also abolished its tax exempt status protected under PBC Act 1973. The license fees for Pakistan Television continued. The license fees collection for PTV was given to WAPDA during Musharraf government. Currently WAPDA collects Rs. 35 per house hold on electricity bills as PTV license fees. Television Broadcasting started in Pakistan with a small pilot TV Station established at Lahore Radio from where transmission was first beamed in Black & White with effect from 26 November 1964. Television centres were established in Dhaka, Karachi and Rawalpindi/Islamabad in 1967 and in Peshawar and Quetta in 1974. PTV has various channels transmitting throughout the world including PTV National, PTV World, PTV 2, PTV Global, PTV Bolan etc. Radio Pakistan has stations covering all the major cities, it covers 80% of the country serving 95.5 Million listeners. It has world service in eleven languages daily.\n\n====Philippines====\nThe Philippines' primary state television broadcaster is [[People's Television Network]] (PTV). Created in 1974 as Government Television (GTV), PTV is no longer state subsidised except for a one-time equity funding for capital outlay in 1992. Aside from PTV, the other public broadcaster is the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC), which the government has already put up for sale. The government no longer holds a [[controlling interest]] in the former state broadcaster, [[Radio Philippines Network]] (RPN).\n\nThe [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) is the country's sole state radio broadcaster. Established in 1933 as KZFM by the American colonial [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Insular Government]], the radio station was passed to the Philippine government after the country [[Republic Day (Philippines)|became independent]] in 1946. Currently, PBS broadcasts its flagship network [[Radyo Pilipinas]] (formerly Radyo ng Bayan) through its 32 stations and selected affiliates nationwide.\n\nThe government is currently planning to propose the creation of a law that will merge and integrate PTV and PBS into a single entity, to be called the People's Broadcasting Corporation (PBC).\n\n====Qatar====\nQatar's public service broadcasting includes Qatar Television which focuses on local affairs, and [[Al Jazeera]] which appeals to a pan-Arab audience in its Arabic broadcasting and to a wider international audience with its English Channel broadcast.  \n\n====Singapore====\n[[Mediacorp]] is the only public broadcasting in Singapore.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea's representative public broadcasting television network is said to be [[Korean Broadcasting System]], or KBS. Originally a government-controlled channel, it is now an independent broadcasting system. KBS began broadcasting radio in 1947 and opened up to television industry in 1961, and officially founded its own identity by 1973. Another public broadcasting channel is the [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], or MBC. Known to be the second channel of the country, it also shares the roles of being national television with the KBS.\n\nSouth Korea also has another public broadcasting channel called [[Educational Broadcasting System]], or EBS. Originally considered to be an extension channel of the KBS, it was spun-off as an educational channel but retained its public broadcasting tasks. KBS and EBS mainly are funded by the commercials that they provide in their channels, but due to growing competitions, this is becoming a problem for them as well.\n\n====Taiwan====\n[[Public Television Service]], also called Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation, is the first independent public broadcasting institution in Taiwan, which broadcasts the Public Television Service Taiwan. Since its creation in 1998, PTS has produced several critically acclaimed dramatic programs and mini-series despite experiencing funding difficulties. PTS is bound up in speaking for the minorities, including the promotion of Hakka Chinese and Formosan-language programming, an effort that has contributed much to the \"Taiwanization\" movement.\n\n===Europe===\n{{see also|European Broadcasting Union}}\n\nIn most countries in Europe, state broadcasters are funded through a mix of advertising and public finance, either through a licence fee or directly from the government.\n\n====Albania====\n[[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar]] (RTSH) is the public broadcaster in [[Albania]].\n\n''Analogue TV''\n* ''Televizioni Shqiptar'' (TVSH) is the name of the first public channel of Albania.

Despite the fact that private broadcasting companies were allowed in Austria in the late 1990s, ORF is still ''the'' key player in the field. It has three nationwide radio channels ([[\u00d61]], [[\u00d63]], [[FM4]]), nine regional ones (one for each [[Bundesland (Austria)|Bundesland]]). Its TV portfolio includes two general interest channels ([[ORF 1]] and [[ORF 2]]), one cultural-instructional channel ([[ORF III]]), one Europe-wide version of ORF 2 and a sports channel ([[ORF Sport +]]). ORF also takes part in the German-language satellite TV network [[3sat]].\n\n====Belgium====\nBelgium has three networks, one for each linguistic community:\n* [[RTBF]], French-language, with 4 TV channels ([[La Une]], [[La Deux]], [[La Trois]] and [[Arte Belgique]]) and 6 radios.\n* [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], Dutch-language, with 3 TV channels and 10 radios.\n* [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]], German-language, with 1 TV channel and 2 radios.\n\nOriginally named INR\u2014''Institut national belge de radiodiffusion'' ({{lang-nl|NIR\u2014Belgisch Nationaal Instituut voor de Radio-omroep|links=no}})\u2014the state-owned broadcasting organization was established by law on 18 June 1930. Television broadcasting from Brussels began in 1953, with two hours of programming each day. In 1960 the INR was subsumed into RTB ({{lang-fr|Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge}}) and BRT ({{lang-nl|Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep}}).\n\nOn 1 October 1945 INR-NIR began to broadcast some programmes in German. In 1961 RTB-BRT began a German-language radio channel, broadcasting from [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nIn 1977, following Belgian [[federalism|federalization]] and the establishment of separate [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language communities]], the French-language section of RTB-BRT became RTBF ({{lang-fr|Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise|links=no}}), German-language section became [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] ({{lang-de|Belgischer Rundfunk|links=no}}) and Dutch-language stays BRT.\n\nBRT was renamed in 1991 to BRTN ({{lang-nl|Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep Nederlandstalige Uitzendingen|links=no}}) and again in 1998 to VRT ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie}}).\n\n====Bulgaria====\nThere are two public media in Bulgaria - the [[Bulgarian National Television]] (BNT) and the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] (BNR). [[Bulgarian National Television]] was founded in 1959 and the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] was founded in 1935. BNT broadcasts 4 national programs (BNT 1, BNT 2, BNT HD, BNT World).

The organisation was founded in 1925, on principles similar to those of the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. DR runs six nationwide television channels and eight radio channels. Financing comes primarily from a yearly licence fee, that everyone who owns either a television set, a computer or other devices that can access the internet, has to pay. A part of collected fees is also used to finance the network of [[TV 2 (Denmark)#Regions|regional public service stations]] operating under the brand of TV 2.

A fourth radio network was added in 1954 and a second television channel in 1963.\n\nRTF was transformed into the [[Office de radiodiffusion t\u00e9l\u00e9vision fran\u00e7aise]] (ORTF), a more independent structure, in 1964. ORTF oversaw the birth of a third television channel in 1972, two years before the dissolution of the structure in 1974. Between this date and 2000, each channel had its own direction structure. The first channel ([[TF1]]) was sold to the private sector in 1987. (At the time, the channel with the largest audience was the other public channel [[Antenne 2]]).\n\nIn 1986 a French/German public channel was created, [[Arte|ARTE]], originally broadcast on cable and satellite. Later, the fall of the private channel [[La Cinq]] freed some frequencies that it had used each day after 19.00. In 1994 a new public channel, [[France5|La cinqui\u00e8me]] was created to use the remaining time on the same frequencies.

R\u00daV is funded by a [[television licence]] fee collected from every income taxpayer, as well as advertising revenue. R\u00daV has been a full active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] since 1956.\n\nR\u00daV\u2014which by the terms of its charter is obliged to \"promote the Icelandic language, Icelandic history, and Iceland's cultural heritage\" and \"honour basic democratic rules, [[human rights]], and the freedom of speech and opinion\"<ref>[http://www.ruv.is/heim/english/english/ R\u00daV's official website (English-language version)] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20060522223149/www.ruv.is/heim/english/english/ |date=2006-05-22 }}</ref>\u2014carries a substantial amount of arts, media, and current affairs programming, in addition to which it also supplies general entertainment in the form of feature films and such internationally popular television drama series as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. R\u00daV's lineup also includes sports coverage, documentaries, domestically produced entertainment shows, and children's programming.\n\n====Ireland====\nIn Ireland there are two state owned public service broadcasters, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] and [[TG4]]. [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] was established in 1960 with the merger of ''Raidi\u00f3 \u00c9ireann'' (1926) and ''Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann'' (1960). TG4 was formed as a subsidiary of ''RT\u00c9'' in 1996 as ''Teilif\u00eds na Gaeilge (TnaG)'', it was re-branded as ''TG4'' in 1999, and was made independent of ''RT\u00c9'' in 2007.\n\nBoth Irish public service broadcasters receive part of the licence fee, with RT\u00c9 taking the lion's share of the funding. Advertising makes up 50% of RT\u00c9's income and just 6% of TG4's income. 7% of the licence fee is provided to the ''[[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]'' since 2006.  Up to 2006 the licence fee was given entirely to ''RT\u00c9''.\n\nRT\u00c9 offers a range of free to air services on television; [[RT\u00c9 1]], [[RT\u00c9 2]], [[RT\u00c9jr]], and [[RT\u00c9 News Now]]. On radio; [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]], [[RT\u00c9 2FM]], [[RT\u00c9 Lyric FM]], and [[RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta]], as well as a number of channels on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]].\n\nThe Sound and Vision Fund is operated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]], this fund receives 7% of the licence fee. The fund is used to assist broadcasters to commission public service broadcast programming. It is open to all independent producers provided they get a free to air or community broadcaster's backing, including [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], [[Today FM]], [[BBC]] Northern Ireland, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]], [[Channel 4]], [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] etc. Pay TV broadcaster [[Setanta Sports]] have also received funding for programming through the sound and vision fund provided they provide those shows on a [[free-to-view]] basis.\n\n[[TG4]] is an independent [[Irish language]] public service broadcaster that is funded by the government through subsidy, the licence fee and through advertising revenue.\n\n''TV3'' is the only independent broadcaster that has public service commitments.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:Rai - Logo 2016.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|RAI brand]]\nThe Italian national broadcasting company is [[RAI]] \u2013 Radiotelevisione Italiana, founded as URI in 1924. RAI transmits thirteen channels: [[Rai 1]], [[Rai 2]], [[Rai 3]], [[Rai 4]], [[Rai 5]], [[Rai News24|Rai News 24]], [[Rai Premium]], [[Rai Movie]], [[Rai Sport]], [[Rai Storia]], [[Rai Gulp]], [[Rai YoYo|Rai Yoyo]], [[Rai Scuola]] (all available also in high definition). RAI also broadcasts via satellite and is involved in radio, publishing and cinema. RAI has the largest audience share (45%) of any Italian television network. Proceeds derive from a periodical standing charge (90 euros for each household in 2017<ref>{{in lang|it}}[http://www.pmi.it/impresa/contabilita-e-fisco/news/134877/canone-rai-90-euro-dal-2017.html Canone RAI a 90 euro dal 2017], PMI.it</ref>) and from advertising. The main competitors of RAI are [[Mediaset]], the biggest national private broadcaster, divided in twelve channels (two of which are both SD and HD), [[La7]] and [[La7d]], owned by Cairo Editore; other competitors are Sky Italia (with three FTA channels) and Discovery Italia (with seven FTA channels).\n\n====Lithuania====\n[[Lithuanian National Radio and Television]] (LRT) is the national broadcaster of Lithuania. It was founded in 1926 as radio broadcaster, and opened a television broadcasting subdivision in 1957. LRT broadcasts three radio stations ([[LRT Radijas]], [[LRT Klasika]] and LRT Opus), and four TV channels ([[LRT televizija]], [[LRT Kult\u016bra]], [[LRT Lituanica]] and LRT HD).\n\n====Malta====\n[[Public Broadcasting Services]] (PBS) is the national broadcaster of Malta. It operates three television services ([[Television Malta|TVM]], [[TVM2]], and [[Parliament TV (Malta)|Parliament TV]]) and three radio services ([[Radio Malta|Radju Malta]], [[Radju Malta 2]], and [[Magic Malta]]).\n\n====Moldova====\n[[Teleradio-Moldova]] (TRM) is the public funded radio-TV broadcaster in Moldova. It owns the TV channels [[Moldova 1]] and [[TV Moldova Interna\u0163ional|TVMI]], and the radio channels [[Radio Moldova]] and [[Radio Moldova Interna\u0163ional]].\n\n====Montenegro====\n[[RTCG]] (Radio Television of Montenegro) is the public broadcaster in Montenegro.\n\n====Netherlands====\n{{Main|Dutch public broadcasting system}}\nThe Netherlands uses a rather unusual system of public broadcasting. Public-broadcasting associations are allocated money and time to broadcast their programmes on the publicly owned television and radio channels, collectively known under the [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep|NPO]] name. The time and money is allocated in proportion to their membership numbers. The system is intended to reflect the diversity of all the groups composing the nation.\n\n====Nordic countries====\nNational public broadcasters in The Nordic countries were modeled after the BBC and established a decade later: Radioordningen (now [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]) in Denmark, Kringkastingselskapet (now [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]]) in Norway, and Radiotj\u00e4nst (now [[Sveriges Radio]] and [[Sveriges Television]]) in Sweden (all in 1925). In 1926 Yleisradio (Swedish: Rundradion) now [[Yle]] was founded in Finland. All four are funded from television licence fees costing (in 2007) around {{\u20ac|230}} ({{USD|300}}) per household per year.<!--Add Iceland here? Faroe Islands?-->\n\n====Poland====\nThe public broadcasters are [[Telewizja Polska]] (TVP) television and [[Polskie Radio]]. TVP operates three main channels: [[TVP 1]], [[TVP 2]] and [[TVP Regionalna]]. It also broadcasts several digital channels (including TVP&nbsp;1, TVP1 HD, TVP 2, TVP2 HD, [[TVP Info]], [[TVP Kultura]], [[TVP Historia]], [[TVP HD]], [[TVP Polonia]], [[TVP Sport]], [[TVP Seriale]]) via satellite and digital terrestrial television system, and 16 regional affiliates (known as TVP Regionalna, regional channels cooperate when creating most of materials). TVP also runs services with news, a video streaming (video on demand) service as well as live streaming of all its channels. [[Polskie Radio]] operates four nationwide radio channels (which are also available via the broadcaster's website). There are also 17 state-owned radio stations broadcasting in particular regions. TVP and Polish Radio are funded from several sources: state funding, advertising, obligatory tax on all TV and radio receivers, and money from authors/copyright associations. The public broadcasters offer a mix of commercial shows and programmes they are, by law, required to broadcast (i.e., [[non-commercial]], niche programmes; programmes for children; programmes promoting different points of view and diversity; programmes for different religious and national groups; live coverage of the parliament's session on its dedicated channel: TVP Parlament; etc.). It has to be politically neutral, although in the past there have been cases of political pressure on TVP and Polskie Radio from the governing party. Recently, a new law has been passed by the ruling Law & Justice party, that in public perception allowed the party to take a much larger control over the media that has been possible before. The party states this law to be the first step to a complete public media overdo. Many worry no such improvements are actually coming and that these recent laws are only another step in taking control over the whole country by the Law & Justice party.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate in Poland about the semi-commercial nature of TVP and PR. Many people fear that making them into totally non-commercial broadcasters would result in the licence fee payable by households being increased, and fewer people being interested in programmes they offer; others say that TVP in particular is too profit-driven and should concentrate on programming that benefits the society.\n\n====Portugal====\n{{Main|R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal}}\n[[File:R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal.svg|thumb|RTP brand]]\nIn Portugal, the national public broadcaster is [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal]] (RTP), which in 1957 began regular broadcasts of its first channel, now [[RTP1]]. In 1968 its second channel appeared, then called \"''segundo programa''\", now [[RTP2]]. In the 1970s, TV arrived in the Portuguese islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], with the creation of two regional channels: [[RTP Madeira]] in 1972 and [[RTP A\u00e7ores]] in 1976.\n\nUntil the 1990s the state had a monopoly on TV broadcasting, so RTP1 and RTP2 were the only Portuguese channels, both with similar [[generalist channel|generalist programmes]]. In 1990, RTP1 was renamed \"Canal&nbsp;1\", and in 1992 RTP2 was renamed \"TV2\". With the creation of the two private channels, [[Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o|SIC]] in 1992 and [[Televis\u00e3o Independente]] in 1993, the philosophy of the public service changed: in 1995, ''TV2'' was again renamed RTP2 and became an alternative channel dedicated to culture, science, arts, documentaries, sports (except football), minorities and children. Since then, RTP2 has carried no advertising. Canal&nbsp;1, renamed back RTP1 also in 1995, remained the commercial channel of RTP group, focused on entertainment, information and major sport competitions. In 2004, after a great restructuring period, RTP started its current branding. That year the two thematic channels of the group were also created\u2014RTPN, a 24 hour-news channel which became RTP Informa\u00e7\u00e3o in 2011 and [[RTP3]] in 2015; and [[RTP Mem\u00f3ria]], dedicated to classic RTP programming. In 2014 the headquarters of RTP2 were transferred from [[Lisbon]] to [[Porto]].\n\nThe group also has two international channels: [[RTP Internacional]], founded in 1992 and dedicated to Europe, Asia and Americas, and [[RTP \u00c1frica]], founded in 1998 focused on Africa, mainly the [[CPLP]] countries of [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]] and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]].\n\nThe RTP group is financed by the advertising revenues from RTP1, RTP Informa\u00e7\u00e3o, RTP Mem\u00f3ria, RTP \u00c1frica, and RTP Internacional, and also by the ''taxa de contribui\u00e7\u00e3o audiovisual'' (broadcasting contribution tax), which is incorporated in electricity bills. Funding from the government budget ceased in 2014, during the [[2010\u201314 Portuguese financial crisis|Portuguese financial crisis]].\n\n====Romania====\n[[Romanian Television]] (TVR) is the national public TV broadcaster in Romania. It operates five channels: [[TVR1]], [[TVR2]], [[TVR3]], [[TVRi]], and [[TVR HD]], along with six regional studios in [[TVR Bucure\u0219ti|Bucharest]], [[TVR Cluj|Cluj-Napoca]], [[TVR Ia\u0219i|Ia\u0219i]], [[TVR Timi\u0219oara|Timi\u0219oara]], [[TVR Craiova|Craiova]], and [[TVR T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219|T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]].\n\nThe public radio broadcaster is [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]] (Radio Romania). It operates [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[AM broadcasting|AM]], and [[webcast|internet]] national, regional, and local radio channels. The regional and local stations are branded as [[Radio Rom\u00e2nia Regional]]. Broadcasting in 12 languages, [[Radio Romania International]] is the company's international radio station.\n\nTVR and Radio Romania are funded through a hybrid financing system, drawing from the state budget, a special tax (incorporated in electricity bills), and advertising too.\n\n====Serbia====\n[[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) is the national public broadcaster in [[Serbia]]. It operates a total of five television channels (RTS1, RTS2, RTS Digital, RTS HD and RTS SAT) and five radio stations (Radio Belgrade&nbsp;1, Radio Belgrade&nbsp;2, Radio Belgrade&nbsp;3, Radio Belgrade 202, and Stereorama). RTS is primarily funded through public television licence fees bundled with electricity bills paid monthly, as well as [[advertising]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=06&dd=25&nav_id=80948|title=Consumer protection group wants TV fees abolished|work=B92|accessdate=October 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083435/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=06&dd=25&nav_id=80948|archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Slovakia====\n\n[[Radio and Television Slovakia]] (RTVS) is the national public broadcaster in [[Slovakia]], with headquarters in [[Bratislava]]. This organisation was created in 2011 by merger of Slovak Television and Slovak Radio. RTVS broadcasts two television channels (STV1, STV2), five FM radio stations (R\u00e1dio Slovensko, R\u00e1dio Dev\u00edn, R\u00e1dio Regina, R\u00e1dio_FM and R\u00e1dio Patria), one satellite radio channel ([[Radio Slovakia International]]) and three digital only radio stations (R\u00e1dio Klasika, R\u00e1dio Litera and R\u00e1dio Junior). RTVS is funded through monthly fee of \u20ac4.64, which every household with electricity connection must pay. The director of RTVS is V\u00e1clav Mika. RTVS is a full member of [[European broadcasting union]].\n\n====Spain====\nIn Spain, being a highly decentralised country, two public broadcasting systems coexist: a national broadcasting television, [[RTVE|Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]] (RTVE), that can be watched all around Spain, and many autonomic TV channels, only broadcast within their respective [[Autonomous Community]]. Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola was founded in 1956, during Franco's dictatorship. It broadcasts two different TV-channels: [[TVE1]] (a.k.a. ''La Primera'' or ''La uno''), that is a wide-range audience general channel; and [[TVE2]], (a.k.a. ''La dos''), that tends to offer cultural programing, as well as sport competitions. Till 2008, RTVE was funded both from public sources and private advertising; however, the Spanish government has recently decreed that, starting in September 2009, RTVE's channels shall be funded with taxpayer's money and with private founding raised from the rest of Spain's private TV stations, thus removing advertising from the broadcaster. A TV licence fee has been suggested, but with little popular success.\n\nMoreover, each of the [[autonomous communities]] of Spain have their own public broadcaster, all of them members of [[FORTA]], usually consisting in either one or two public channels that tend to reproduce the model set up by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola: a general channel and a more cultural related one. In the Autonomous Communities that have their own official language besides Spanish, those channels may broadcast not in Spanish, but in the other co-official language. For example, this occurs in [[Catalonia]], where [[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]] broadcasts mainly in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. In the [[Valencian Community]], [[CVMC]] broadcasts a TV channnel and a radio network, both branded as \u00c0 Punt<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apuntmedia.es|title=\u00c0 Punt M\u00e8dia|last=|first=|date=|website=\u00c0 Punt M\u00e8dia, the public valencian media|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and mainly broadcast on [[Valencian]]. In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Euskal Telebista]] (ETB) has three channels, two of which broadcast only in [[Basque language|basque]] ([[ETB 1]] and [[ETB 3]]), whereas the other ([[ETB 2]]) broadcasts in Spanish. In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Television de Galicia]] and the [[Television de Galicia|G2]]. All the autonomic networks are publicly funded, and also admit private advertising.\n\n====Sweden====\n[[File:SVT 2016.svg|upright|thumb|The logo of SVT]]\n[[File:Sveriges-Radio-Logo.svg|thumb|The logo of Sveriges Radio]]\nSweden has three public service broadcasters, namely [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT), [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] (UR), and [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), having previously had government monopoly. SVT is the national public television broadcaster with 4 channels (SVT 1, SVT 2, SVT Barnkanalen, and SVT 24). The aim is to make programs for everybody. For example, Sweden has the historic [[Sami people|Sami]] minority and SVT make programs in their language for them to watch. There are also a Finnish minority in Sweden, thus SVT show news in Finnish on [[SVT Uutiset]]. SR is the radio equivalent of SVT, with channels P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and the Finnish channel SR Sisuradio.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{main|Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom}}\nThe United Kingdom has a strong tradition of public service broadcasting. In addition to the [[BBC]], established in 1922, there is also [[Channel 4]], a publicly owned, commercially funded public service broadcaster, and [[S4C]], a Welsh-language broadcaster in Wales. Furthermore, the two commercial broadcasters [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also have significant public service obligations imposed as part of their licence to broadcast.\n\nIn the UK there are also small community broadcasters. There are now 228 stations with FM broadcast licences (licensed by [[Ofcom]]). Community radio stations typically cover a small geographical area with a coverage radius of up to 5&nbsp;km and run on a nonprofit basis. They can cater for whole communities or for different areas of interest\u2014such as a particular ethnic group, age group or interest group. Community radio stations reflect a diverse mix of cultures and interests. For example, you can listen to stations catering to urban or experimental music, while others are aimed at younger people, religious communities or the armed forces and their families.\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nIn Australia, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) is owned by the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] and is 100% taxpayer funded. The multicultural [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS), another public broadcaster, now accepts limited sponsorship and advertising.\n\nIn addition, there is a large Australian [[community radio]] sector, funded in part by federal grants via the Community Broadcasting Foundation, but largely sustained via subscriptions, donations and business sponsorship. As of February 2020, there are 450+ fully licensed community radio stations <ref>https://www.cbaa.org.au/about/about-community-broadcasting</ref> and a number of [[community television]] stations (most operating as [[Channel 31 (Australia)|Channel 31]] despite being unrelated across different states). They are organised similarly to PBS and NPR stations in the United States, and take on the role that [[public access television]] stations have in the US.\n\n====New Zealand====\nIn New Zealand all broadcasters are given a small slice of public broadcasting responsibility, because of the state-funded agency [[NZ On Air]]. This is because of NZ On Air's requirement for public-service programmes across all channels and stations, instead of being put into one single network. The former public broadcaster BCNZ (formerly NZBC \u2013 [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]]) was broken up into separate state-owned corporations, [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ) and [[Radio New Zealand]] (RNZ). While RNZ remains commercial-free, about 90% of funding for TVNZ comes from selling advertising during programmes on their two stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/823782|title=The TVNZ Charter|accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref><ref name=\"Te Ara\">{{cite web |last1=McMillan |first1=Kate |title=Media and politics - Ownership and Regulation |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/media-and-politics/page-2 |publisher=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref> TVNZ continues to be a public broadcaster; however like [[CBC Television]] in Canada it is essentially a fully commercial network in continuous ratings battles with other stations, which continues to be a [[TVNZ#Controversies|controversial issue]] within New Zealand. With the shutdown of TVNZ&nbsp;7, the only fully non-commercial public-service network in New Zealand is [[Radio New Zealand]].\n\nAside from television, New Zealand has a rich public radio culture, [[Radio New Zealand]] being the main provider, with a varied network ([[Radio New Zealand National]]) and a classical musical network ([[Radio New Zealand Concert]]). RNZ also provides the Pacific with its [[Radio New Zealand International]]. Aside from RNZ almost all of [[Regions of New Zealand|New Zealand's 16 regions]] has an \"[[Association of Community Access Broadcasters|access radio]]\" network. All these networks are commercial-free.<ref name=\"Te Ara\" />\n\nIn late January 2020, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]] announced that they were planning to merge TVNZ and Radio New Zealand to create a new public broadcasting service.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Jane |title=New details revealed as Cabinet agrees on RNZ, TVNZ public
