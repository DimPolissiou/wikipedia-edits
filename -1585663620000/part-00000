An offshoot of the Mexican stable ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' from the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, the group was formed in November 2015 by Naito, [[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]] and [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]], but has since come to also include [[Seiya Sanada|Sanada]], [[Hiromu Takahashi]], and [[Shingo Takagi]]. Through NJPW's working relationship with other companies, they have also appeared in CMLL and in the American [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) promotion.\n\nDespite being smaller in numbers than full-scale factions such as [[Bullet Club]] or [[Chaos (professional wrestling)|Chaos]], ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'' has established itself as one of the most prominent and most popular stables in NJPW. As part of the stable, Naito has held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]], the top championship of the company, on two occasions, and the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] five times; he is the first (and currently only) wrestler to have held both titles simultaneously. Among the other accomplishments of the stable are two [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] reigns and two [[G1 Tag League]] wins for the [[tag team]] of Evil and Sanada, four [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] reigns divided between Bushi and Takahashi, one [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] reign from Bushi and Takagi, two [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] reigns from Evil and a current reign for Takagi, and a record three [[NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship]] reigns for Bushi, Evil and Sanada, plus a fourth reign for Bushi and Evil with Takagi; overall, twenty title reigns took place within the stable. ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' cited ''L.I.J.''{{'}}s impact on NJPW as one of the main factors in the magazine naming Naito the 2016 [[Tokyo Sports Puroresu Awards#MVP Award|Wrestler of the Year]], a feat he repeated the following year.\n\n==History==\n=== Origins and background (2013\u20132016) ===\n[[File:Tetsuya Nait\u014d 2016.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Tetsuya Naito]], the leader of ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'']]\nIn June 2013, [[Tetsuya Naito]] returned to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) from a legitimate [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]]. Two months later, Naito defeated [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in the finals to win NJPW's premier singles tournament, the [[G1 Climax#2013|G1 Climax]]. Despite being a clean-cut [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], Naito was soundly rejected by NJPW fans and his win over Tanahashi was booed. NJPW had pegged Naito as their next top babyface star, but seeing how the fans were reacting to him, the company changed their course of action and announced a fan vote to decide whether the planned [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] match between Naito and [[Kazuchika Okada]] or an [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] match between [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] and Hiroshi Tanahashi would main event the promotion's biggest event of the year, [[Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome]]. The fans voted Nakamura and Tanahashi to main event the show with Naito and Okada relegated to semi-main event. After failing to capture the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Okada, Naito would remain a step below the top spot in NJPW.<ref name=IngobernableRise>{{cite web | url = http://pwinsider.com/article/101347/ingobernable-tetsuya-naitos-rise-to-the-top-of-new-japan.html?p=1 | title = Ingobernable: Tetsuya Naito's rise to the top of New Japan | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=April 15, 2016 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/710281/ | script-title=ja:\u3010\u65b0\u65e5\uff27\uff11\u3011\u5185\u85e4\u3000\u9ed2\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u5857\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u5149\u308a\u306e\u738b\u8005\u3078 | date=July 19, 2017 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Naito, through a working relationship between NJPW and the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, worked a tour of CMLL, during which he joined the ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528114739/http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u54f2\u4e5f\u304c\u30bd\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30ed\u30b9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b4\u30d9\u30eb\u30ca\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u300d\u306b\u6b63\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165!? \u30105.27\u30a2\u30ec\u30ca\u30e1\u30d2\u30b3\u8a18\u8005\u4f1a\u898b\u3011 | archivedate=May 28, 2015 | date=May 28, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://rotativo.com.mx/deportes/412051-la-sombra-integra-a-japones-naito-a-los-ingobernables/ | title = La Sombra integra a japon\u00e9s Naito a Los Ingobernables | date=May 27, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Diario Rotativo | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/stable-money-how-wwe-playing-catch-rest-wrestling-world-208476 | title = Stable Money: How WWE is playing catch up to the rest of the wrestling world | last=Dominello | first=Zach | date=March 6, 2016 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> Upon his June return to NJPW, Naito continued representing ''Los Ingobernables'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/416110/ | script-title=ja:\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u304b\u3076\u308c\uff1f\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u672c\u968a\u96e2\u8131\u3082 | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> adopting the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] attitude associated with the stable,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pwinsider.com/article/94748/628-new-japan-road-to-dominion-in-tokyo-japan-report.html?p=1 | title = 6/28 New Japan Road to Dominion in Tokyo, Japan report | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref> using the fans' rejection of him as a catalyst for the change.<ref name=IngobernableRise/> In the weeks leading to October's [[King of Pro-Wrestling (2015)|King of Pro-Wrestling]] event, Naito began teasing bringing in a ''pareja'' (\"partner\") to witness his match against [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], contested for Tanahashi's contract for a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at [[Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/453644/ | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u4e0d\u6c17\u5473\u4e88\u544a \u30d1\u30ec\u30cf\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\uff12\u5bfe\uff11\u3067\u68da\u6a4b\u6f70\u3059 | date=October 3, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> At the October 12 event, [[Takaaki Watanabe]], making his NJPW return after a two-year overseas learning excursion, was revealed as Naito's ''pareja'' as he attacked Hiroshi Tanahashi during his match with Naito.

Ungovernables of Japan\"), also shortened to  '''''L.I.J.''''',  is a Japanese [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], based in the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] and led by [[Tetsuya Naito]]. An offshoot of the Mexican stable ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' from the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, the group was formed in November 2015 by Naito, [[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]] and [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]], but has since come to also include [[Seiya Sanada|Sanada]], [[Hiromu Takahashi]], and [[Shingo Takagi]]. Through NJPW's working relationship with other companies, they have also appeared in CMLL and in the American [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) promotion.\n\nDespite being smaller in numbers than full-scale factions such as [[Bullet Club]] or [[Chaos (professional wrestling)|Chaos]], ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'' has established itself as one of the most prominent and most popular stables in NJPW. As part of the stable, Naito has held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]], the top championship of the company, on two occasions, and the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] five times; he is the first (and currently only) wrestler to have held both titles simultaneously. Among the other accomplishments of the stable are two [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] reigns and two [[G1 Tag League]] wins for the [[tag team]] of Evil and Sanada, four [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] reigns divided between Bushi and Takahashi, one [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] reign from Bushi and Takagi, two [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] reigns from Evil and a current reign for Takagi, and a record three [[NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship]] reigns for Bushi, Evil and Sanada, plus a fourth reign for Bushi and Evil with Takagi; overall, twenty title reigns took place within the stable. ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' cited ''L.I.J.''{{'}}s impact on NJPW as one of the main factors in the magazine naming Naito the 2016 [[Tokyo Sports Puroresu Awards#MVP Award|Wrestler of the Year]], a feat he repeated the following year.\n\n==History==\n=== Origins and background (2013\u20132016) ===\n[[File:Tetsuya Nait\u014d 2016.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Tetsuya Naito]], the leader of ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'']]\nIn June 2013, [[Tetsuya Naito]] returned to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) from a legitimate [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]]. Two months later, Naito defeated [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in the finals to win NJPW's premier singles tournament, the [[G1 Climax#2013|G1 Climax]]. Despite being a clean-cut [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], Naito was soundly rejected by NJPW fans and his win over Tanahashi was booed. NJPW had pegged Naito as their next top babyface star, but seeing how the fans were reacting to him, the company changed their course of action and announced a fan vote to decide whether the planned [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] match between Naito and [[Kazuchika Okada]] or an [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] match between [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] and Hiroshi Tanahashi would main event the promotion's biggest event of the year, [[Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome]]. The fans voted Nakamura and Tanahashi to main event the show with Naito and Okada relegated to semi-main event. After failing to capture the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Okada, Naito would remain a step below the top spot in NJPW.<ref name=IngobernableRise>{{cite web | url = http://pwinsider.com/article/101347/ingobernable-tetsuya-naitos-rise-to-the-top-of-new-japan.html?p=1 | title = Ingobernable: Tetsuya Naito's rise to the top of New Japan | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=April 15, 2016 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/710281/ | script-title=ja:\u3010\u65b0\u65e5\uff27\uff11\u3011\u5185\u85e4\u3000\u9ed2\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u5857\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u5149\u308a\u306e\u738b\u8005\u3078 | date=July 19, 2017 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Naito, through a working relationship between NJPW and the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, worked a tour of CMLL, during which he joined the ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528114739/http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u54f2\u4e5f\u304c\u30bd\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30ed\u30b9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b4\u30d9\u30eb\u30ca\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u300d\u306b\u6b63\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165!? \u30105.27\u30a2\u30ec\u30ca\u30e1\u30d2\u30b3\u8a18\u8005\u4f1a\u898b\u3011 | archivedate=May 28, 2015 | date=May 28, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://rotativo.com.mx/deportes/412051-la-sombra-integra-a-japones-naito-a-los-ingobernables/ | title = La Sombra integra a japon\u00e9s Naito a Los Ingobernables | date=May 27, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Diario Rotativo | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/stable-money-how-wwe-playing-catch-rest-wrestling-world-208476 | title = Stable Money: How WWE is playing catch up to the rest of the wrestling world | last=Dominello | first=Zach | date=March 6, 2016 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> Upon his June return to NJPW, Naito continued representing ''Los Ingobernables'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/416110/ | script-title=ja:\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u304b\u3076\u308c\uff1f\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u672c\u968a\u96e2\u8131\u3082 | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> adopting the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] attitude associated with the stable,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pwinsider.com/article/94748/628-new-japan-road-to-dominion-in-tokyo-japan-report.html?p=1 | title = 6/28 New Japan Road to Dominion in Tokyo, Japan report | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref> using the fans' rejection of him as a catalyst for the change.<ref name=IngobernableRise/> In the weeks leading to October's [[King of Pro-Wrestling (2015)|King of Pro-Wrestling]] event, Naito began teasing bringing in a ''pareja'' (\"partner\") to witness his match against [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], contested for Tanahashi's contract for a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at [[Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/453644/ | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u4e0d\u6c17\u5473\u4e88\u544a \u30d1\u30ec\u30cf\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\uff12\u5bfe\uff11\u3067\u68da\u6a4b\u6f70\u3059 | date=October 3, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> At the October 12 event, [[Takaaki Watanabe]], making his NJPW return after a two-year overseas learning excursion, was revealed as Naito's ''pareja'' as he attacked Hiroshi Tanahashi during his match with Naito.

In this model, matter creates defects in spacetime which generate curvature. This curvature reproduces all the effects of [[general relativity]], but leads to different physics than string theory at the scale of the [[Planck length]].

Chervyakov, Kleinert developed an extension of the theory of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] from linear spaces to [[semigroup]]s by defining their products uniquely (in the mathematical theory, only linear combinations are defined). The extension is motivated by the physical requirement that the corresponding [[path integral formulation|path integrals]] must be invariant under coordinate transformations,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title =Rules for integrals over products of distributions from coordinate independence of path integrals\n|author1=Kleinert H. |author2=Chervyakov A. | journal = Eur.

In this model, matter creates defects in spacetime which generate curvature. This curvature reproduces all the effects of [[general relativity]], but leads to different physics than string theory at the scale of the [[Planck length]]. This theory inspired Italian artist [http://www.laurapesce.it/ Laura Pesce] to create glass sculptures entitled [http://www.laurapesce.it/main/exhibitions/DICE2006/DICE2006.html \"world crystal\"] (see also lower left on [http://www.laurapesce.it/main/exhibitions/ArteScienza/ArteScienza.html this page]).\n\n==Current work==\nKleinert is a senior member of the faculty for the International Relativistic Astrophysics Ph.D. [http://www.icra.it/IRAPPhD/2007/Welcome.htm (IRAP)] Project, which forms part of the international network for astrophysics ([[ICRANet]]).
