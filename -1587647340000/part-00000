For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person.

A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to.

He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

It is also recommended that the whole sample be divided into two and cross-validated.<ref name=KL/>\n\n== Ideal reliability level and how to increase reliability ==\n=== Nunnally's recommendations for the level of reliability===\nThe most frequently cited source of how much reliability coefficients should be is Nunnally's book.<ref name=n1>Nunnally, J. C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L. J. (1943). On estimates of test reliability. Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated the unidimensionality of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

Educational and Psychological Measurement, 64(3), 391\u2013418. https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164404266386</ref> encouraged readers to use generalizability theory rather than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory.

Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't understand the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items. That is, <math>\\sigma^2_t=\\overline{\\sigma_{ij}}</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_T=Var(\\sum_{i=1}^k t)=k^2 \\sigma^2_t = k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} </math>\n\nLet <math> \\rho_T </math> denote the reliability when satisfying the above assumptions. <math> \\rho_T</math> is:\n\n</br><math>\\rho_T = {k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} \\over \\sigma^2_X} </math>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/spsstutorial/files/tutorials/cronbachs-alpha.pdf Cronbach's alpha SPSS tutorial]\n* The free web interface and R package cocron [http://comparingcronbachalphas.org] allows to statistically compare two or more dependent or independent cronbach alpha coefficients.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cronbach's Alpha}}\n[[Category:Comparison of assessments]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology research methods]]\n", "name_user": "Eunscho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eKuder and Richardson (1937)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha"}

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Ritter's character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death. New male characters, played by [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]], were later added to the main cast as Ritter's replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by [[Henry Winkler]], the executive producer of the show and very close friend of Ritter's.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Dubb''' (formerly known as B.O.W.; born 2 January 1970) is a semi-retired [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rap music|rapper]] best known as the frontman of the hip-hop group the [[Bomfunk MC's]].\n\n== Early career ==\n\nRaymond was born in [[London]] to a [[Jamaica]]n-[[England|English]] father and a Finnish mother. He began recording music as a teenager in the early 90s as part of the hip hop group \"The Master Brothers\", who often performed over DJ sets at clubs. Whilst no recordings were made, some of their performances were recorded, and have emerged online. Around this time, Raymond performed guest raps on the song Cryin' Out by Rama (1994).\n\n== Soup De Loop ==\n\nIn 1995, Raymond teamed up with longtime producer Jaakko \"[[JS16]]\" Salovaara and singer Mari Vesala to form the pop group Soup De Loop, and signed to the now defunct Blue Bubble Records. Their music was a combination of female sung house and G-Funk hip hop music, with Mari singing and Raymond providing raps. The group released an album, \"Brainspotting\" in 1997, as well as several singles including \"Keep On Doing\", which was a hit in Finland and appeared on several dance compilations around the time. Despite this, the group didn't have any success outside Finland. Mari left the group some time after the album was released, and they broke up rather than look for another singer.\n\n== Bomfunk MCs - 1999-2005 ==\n\nAfter the breakup of Soup De Loop, Ebanks and Salovaara teamed up with DJ Ismo \"DJ Gismo\" Lappalainen to form Bomfunk MCs. The band were signed to Sony Music Finland due to Blue Bubble Records going down under. The band quickly became known for the breakdancing in their videos and the graffiti in their album cover designs, both things which contributed to their popularity. Despite the associations with breakdancing, the band did perform slower paced hip hop songs as well and some more trancey material later on. The group released two albums with DJ Gismo - [[In Stereo (Bomfunk MC's album)|In Stereo]] and [[Burnin' Sneakers]], and released a number of successful singles, the most notable of which being [[Uprocking Beats]] and [[Freestyler (song)|Freestyler]]. Freestyler in particular became the band's signature song, which they are still remembered for to this day.\n\nThe band remained popular in Finland and Europe, but lost popularity elsewhere and their last release in the UK was \"Super Electric\", whose parent album, [[Burnin' Sneakers]] was never released in the UK due to poor sales of the single. However, the band contributed the official World Cup 2002 song for Sweden \"[[I Know There's Something Going On|(Crack It) Something Goin' On]]\", as well as contributed \"Put Your Hands Up\" and \"We R Atomic\" to the PlayStation game [[Firebugs (video game)|Firebugs]], in which they appeared as playable characters. These appearances revived the band's popularity in the UK, but it wasn't enough for the album to be released there. DJ Gismo left Bomfunk MCs in 2002 in order to join the group Stonedeep. He was replaced by Skillsters duo, which consists of Riku Pentti (DJ) and Okke Komulainen (keyboards).\n\nIn 2004, Salovaara guested on a number of songs by [[Beats And Styles]]. These have been erroneously credited as Bomfunk MC's songs, although the only real difference is the producer.\n\nIn 2005, the group signed to Universal/Polydor and recorded the album \"Reverse Psychology\". This album was very different to the previous two, as it had far more of a straightforward hip hop sound, in that respect, more in common with the \"Soup De Loop\" material. The album was half produced by Salovaara, and the other half by Pentti and Komulainen. The band also experimented more with trance inspired songs such as \"Hypnotic\" and \"Turn It Up\", and dance-rock songs such as \"No Way In Hell\" and \"Reverse Psychology\". The album also featured a guest appearance from [[Kurtis Blow]], of [[The Breaks (Kurtis Blow song)|The Breaks]] fame. Whilst the album produced the big European hit \"No Way In Hell\", it quickly became rare and obscure, due to only being released in Scandinavia, Germany and Eastern Europe. DJ Gismo appears on the cover of the album despite not contributing to it, this is likely to be for marketing reasons.\n\nA while after the release of the album, the group quietly split up. It has said this was due to Ebanks desire to retire from the spotlight. Salovaara has continued producing music.\n\n== Post-Bomfunk MCs ==\n\nSince Bomfunk MC's breakup, Ebanks has largely disappeared from the music industry, although he did guest on a few tracks.\n\nIn 2011 a Finnish rap compilation \"{{lang|fi|Rappiotaidetta: Suomir\u00e4pin Vaippaik\u00e4}}\" was released, which features Ebanks performing a song entitled \"{{lang|fi|Keijo Ei Pelaa}}\" under the pseudonym Keijo K from 1990. It is possibly the only released recording of Ebanks rapping in Finnish.\n\nIn 2014 Soup De Loop's album Brainspotting appeared for digital download worldwide, after being an out of print and expensive Finland-only release for years. The masters were owned by Sony-BMG who had taken over the Blue Bubble Label on which the album was originally released.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===with Soup De Loop===\n\n===Albums===\n\"Brainspotting\" (1997)\n\n===Singles===\n*\"Keep On Doing\" (1995)\n*\"Love The Way\" (1996)\n*\"I Gotta Get Away\" (1997)\n*\"What Was Said And Done\" (1997)\n\n===With Bomfunk MC's===\n\n===Albums===\n*1999 - ''[[In Stereo (Bomfunk MC's album)|In Stereo]]'' (Sony Music/Epidrome) (Worldwide)\n*2002 - ''[[Burnin' Sneakers]]'' (Sony Music/Epidrome) (Europe only [not UK])\n*2005 - ''[[Reverse Psychology]]'' (Universal Music/Polydor) (Europe only [not UK])\n\n===Singles===\n*\"Uprocking Beats (1998/1999) (UK, Germany, Sweden, Finland and Australia)\n*\"[[Freestyler (song)|Freestyler]]\" (1999 Finland only) (2000 Worldwide)\n*\"B-Boys & Flygirls\" (1999) (Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Australia)\n*\"Sky's The Limit\" (1999) (Promo only, Finland only) \n*\"Rocking Just To Make Ya Move\" (1999) (Finland only)\n*\"Other Emcees\" (1999) (Finland only) \n*\"Super Electric\" (2001) (UK and Europe - this was the band's last single in the UK)\n*\"Live Your Life\" (feat.

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\".

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* Nick Kobe - songwriter\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|5|year=2020|week=16|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=15&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 15, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|4|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=16?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 16, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|3|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 1\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/16|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 16|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

The Choral Fantasy, Op. 80 (1808), basically a [[piano concerto]] movement, brings in a choir and vocal soloists near the end for the climax. The vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]).\n\nGoing further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song \"Gegenliebe\" (Returned Love) for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.{{sfn|Hopkins|1981|p=249}} According to Robert W.

Italian composers [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were known to have written roles specifically for her voice.<ref>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] and Bourne, Joyce (1996).

However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the tempos. He was turning the pages of his score and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.\n\nThere are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p=22}}</ref> On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph B\u00f6hm]] recalled:\n\n{{quote|Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts.\u2014The actual direction was in [Louis] Duport's{{refn|group=n|Presumably, B\u00f6hm meant the conductor Michael Umlauf}} hands; we musicians followed his baton only.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=22}}</ref>}}\n\nWhen the audience applauded\u2014testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or symphony\u2014Beethoven was several bars off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to the critic for the ''Theater-Zeitung'', \"the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=23}}</ref> The audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, and raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\n===Editions===\nThe first German edition was printed by [[Schott Music|B.

[[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30 in E{{music|flat}} major]], as did [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in three of the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|Haydn Quartets]] and the [[String Quintet No. 4 (Mozart)|G minor String Quintet]].\n\n=== I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso ===\nThe first movement is in [[sonata form]] without an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. It begins with [[open fifth]]s (A and E) played ''[[Dynamics (music)#Dynamic markings|pianissimo]]'' by [[tremolo]] strings, steadily building up until the first main theme in [[D minor]] at m. 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=28}}</ref>\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 88\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #17\n\n        \\partial 32 d32\\ff^\\markup \"First theme\"\n        a4~ a8.. f32\n        d8.. a32 f8. a32( f)\n        d4~ d16 f'-. e-. d-.\n        a'8-. g-. e-. a-.\n        d,8.\\sf\n    }\n</score>\n\nThe opening, with its perfect fifth quietly emerging, resembles the sound of an orchestra [[Musical tuning|tuning up]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/beethovenssympho0000youn|title=Beethoven's Symphonies: A Guided Tour|last=Young|first=John Bell|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1574671698|location=New York|oclc=180757068|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (which repeats the main melodic themes) in m. 301, the theme returns, this time played ''fortissimo'' and in D ''major'', rather than D ''minor''. The movement ends with a massive [[Coda (music)|coda]] that takes up nearly a quarter of the movement, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphonies]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=30}}</ref>\n\nA typical performance lasts about 15 minutes.\n\n=== II. Molto vivace ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe second movement is a [[scherzo|scherzo and trio]]. Like the first movement, the scherzo is in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata]], written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three bars\u2014perhaps because of the fast tempo\u2014with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Normally, a scherzo is in [[Triple metre|triple time]]. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in [[Duple and quadruple metre|quadruple time]].\n\nWhile adhering to the standard [[Ternary form#Compound ternary or trio form|compound ternary design]] (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a [[fugue]] in D minor on the subject below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2. = 116\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 3/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #9\n        \\bar \"\"\n\n        a4.\\pp^\\markup \"First theme\" a,8 a4\n        d4-. e-. f-.\n        e-. f-. g-.\n        f-. e-. d-.\n        f e d\n        c b a\n        gis a b\n        a gis a\n    }\n</score>\n\nFor the second subject, it modulates to the unusual key of [[C major]]. The exposition then repeats before a short [[development section]], where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].\n\nThe contrasting trio section is in [[D major]] and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.\n\nThe duration of the movement is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two (frequently omitted) repeats are played.\n\n=== III. Adagio molto e cantabile ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe third movement is a lyrical, slow movement in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]\u2014a [[minor sixth]] away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a [[Double variation|double variation form]], with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in {{music|time|4|4}} time, the second in {{music|time|12|8}}. The variations are separated by passages in {{music|time|3|4}}, the first in D major, the second in [[G major]], the third in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], and the fourth in [[B major]]. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud [[fanfare]]s from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned to the fourth player.\n\nA performance lasts about 16 minutes.\n\n===IV. Finale===\nThe choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood based on the \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" theme and is in theme and [[Variation (music)|variations]] form.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\\new Score {\n  \\new Staff {\n    \\relative c {\n      \\set Staff.instrumentName = #\"Vc.\"\n      \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"cello\"\n      \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #92\n      \\time 4/4\n      \\key d \\major\n      \\clef bass\n      \\tempo \"Allegro assai\" 2 = 60\n      \\set Score.tempoHideNote=##t\n      \\bar \"\"\n        fis2\\p( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | fis4.( e8) e2 |\n        fis2( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2 | \\break\n        e( fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 e) | d( e a,) fis'~ |\n        fis fis( g a) | a( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2\n    }\n  }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe movement starts with an introduction in which musical material from each of the preceding three movements\u2014though none are literal quotations of previous music<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=36}}</ref>\u2014are successively presented and then dismissed by [[Recitative#Instrumental recitative|instrumental recitatives]] played by the low strings. Following this, the \"Ode to Joy\" theme is finally introduced by the cellos and double basses. After three instrumental variations on this theme, the human voice is presented for the first time in the symphony by the baritone soloist, who sings words written by Beethoven himself: <nowiki>''</nowiki>''O Freunde, nicht diese T\u00f6ne!' Sondern la\u00dft uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere''.<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\"Oh friends, not these sounds!

Indeed, it is longer than some entire symphonies of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Its form has been disputed by musicologists, as [[Nicholas Cook]] explains:\n\n{{Quote|Beethoven had difficulty describing the finale himself; in letters to publishers, he said that it was like his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, only on a much grander scale. We might call it a [[cantata]] constructed round a series of variations on the \"Joy\" theme. But this is rather a loose formulation, at least by comparison with the way in which many twentieth-century critics have tried to codify the movement's form.

The vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]).\n\nGoing further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song \"Gegenliebe\" (Returned Love) for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.{{sfn|Hopkins|1981|p=249}} According to Robert W.

However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the tempos. He was turning the pages of his score and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.\n\nThere are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p=22}}</ref> On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph B\u00f6hm]] recalled:\n\n{{quote|Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts.\u2014The actual direction was in [Louis] Duport's{{refn|group=n|Presumably, B\u00f6hm meant the conductor Michael Umlauf}} hands; we musicians followed his baton only.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=22}}</ref>}}\n\nWhen the audience applauded\u2014testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or symphony\u2014Beethoven was several bars off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to the critic for the ''Theater-Zeitung'', \"the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=23}}</ref> The audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, and raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\n===Editions===\nThe first German edition was printed by [[Schott Music|B.

[[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30 in E{{music|flat}} major]], as did [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in three of the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|Haydn Quartets]] and the [[String Quintet No. 4 (Mozart)|G minor String Quintet]].\n\n=== I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso ===\nThe first movement is in [[sonata form]] without an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. It begins with [[open fifth]]s (A and E) played ''[[Dynamics (music)#Dynamic markings|pianissimo]]'' by [[tremolo]] strings, steadily building up until the first main theme in [[D minor]] at m. 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=28}}</ref>\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 88\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #17\n\n        \\partial 32 d32\\ff^\\markup \"First theme\"\n        a4~ a8.. f32\n        d8.. a32 f8. a32( f)\n        d4~ d16 f'-. e-. d-.\n        a'8-. g-. e-. a-.\n        d,8.\\sf\n    }\n</score>\n\nThe opening, with its perfect fifth quietly emerging, resembles the sound of an orchestra [[Musical tuning|tuning up]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/beethovenssympho0000youn|title=Beethoven's Symphonies: A Guided Tour|last=Young|first=John Bell|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1574671698|location=New York|oclc=180757068|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (which repeats the main melodic themes) in m. 301, the theme returns, this time played ''fortissimo'' and in D ''major'', rather than D ''minor''. The movement ends with a massive [[Coda (music)|coda]] that takes up nearly a quarter of the movement, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphonies]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=30}}</ref>\n\nA typical performance lasts about 15 minutes.\n\n=== II. Molto vivace ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe second movement is a [[scherzo|scherzo and trio]]. Like the first movement, the scherzo is in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata]], written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three bars\u2014perhaps because of the fast tempo\u2014with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Normally, a scherzo is in [[Triple metre|triple time]]. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in [[Duple and quadruple metre|quadruple time]].\n\nWhile adhering to the standard [[Ternary form#Compound ternary or trio form|compound ternary design]] (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a [[fugue]] in D minor on the subject below.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n    \\relative c''' {\n        \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2. = 116\n        \\key d \\minor\n        \\time 3/4\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #9\n        \\bar \"\"\n\n        a4.\\pp^\\markup \"First theme\" a,8 a4\n        d4-. e-. f-.\n        e-. f-. g-.\n        f-. e-. d-.\n        f e d\n        c b a\n        gis a b\n        a gis a\n    }\n</score>\n\nFor the second subject, it modulates to the unusual key of [[C major]]. The exposition then repeats before a short [[development section]], where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].\n\nThe contrasting trio section is in [[D major]] and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.\n\nThe duration of the movement is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two (frequently omitted) repeats are played.\n\n=== III. Adagio molto e cantabile ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe third movement is a lyrical, slow movement in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]\u2014a [[minor sixth]] away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a [[Double variation|double variation form]], with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in {{music|time|4|4}} time, the second in {{music|time|12|8}}. The variations are separated by passages in {{music|time|3|4}}, the first in D major, the second in [[G major]], the third in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], and the fourth in [[B major]]. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud [[fanfare]]s from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned to the fourth player.\n\nA performance lasts about 16 minutes.\n\n===IV. Finale===\nThe choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood based on the \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" theme and is in theme and [[Variation (music)|variations]] form.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\\new Score {\n  \\new Staff {\n    \\relative c {\n      \\set Staff.instrumentName = #\"Vc.\"\n      \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"cello\"\n      \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #92\n      \\time 4/4\n      \\key d \\major\n      \\clef bass\n      \\tempo \"Allegro assai\" 2 = 60\n      \\set Score.tempoHideNote=##t\n      \\bar \"\"\n        fis2\\p( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | fis4.( e8) e2 |\n        fis2( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2 | \\break\n        e( fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 d) | e( fis8 g fis4 e) | d( e a,) fis'~ |\n        fis fis( g a) | a( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2\n    }\n  }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe movement starts with an introduction in which musical material from each of the preceding three movements\u2014though none are literal quotations of previous music<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=36}}</ref>\u2014are successively presented and then dismissed by [[Recitative#Instrumental recitative|instrumental recitatives]] played by the low strings. Following this, the \"Ode to Joy\" theme is finally introduced by the cellos and double basses. After three instrumental variations on this theme, the human voice is presented for the first time in the symphony by the baritone soloist, who sings words written by Beethoven himself: <nowiki>''</nowiki>''O Freunde, nicht diese T\u00f6ne!' Sondern la\u00dft uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere''.<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\"Oh friends, not these sounds!

Indeed, it is longer than some entire symphonies of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Its form has been disputed by musicologists, as [[Nicholas Cook]] explains:\n\n{{Quote|Beethoven had difficulty describing the finale himself; in letters to publishers, he said that it was like his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, only on a much grander scale. We might call it a [[cantata]] constructed round a series of variations on the \"Joy\" theme. But this is rather a loose formulation, at least by comparison with the way in which many twentieth-century critics have tried to codify the movement's form. Thus there have been interminable arguments as to whether it should be seen as a kind of sonata form (with the [[Turkish music (style)|\"Turkish\" music]] of bar 331, which is in B{{music|flat}} major, functioning as a kind of second group), or a kind of [[Concerto|concerto form]] (with bars 1\u2013207 and 208\u2013330 together making up a double exposition), or even a conflation of four symphonic movements into one (with bars 331\u2013594 representing a Scherzo, and bars 595\u2013654 a slow movement). The reason these arguments are interminable is that each interpretation contributes something to the understanding of the movement, but does not represent the whole story.<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=34}}</ref>}}\n\nCook gives the following table describing the form of the movement:<ref>{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=35}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: Silver\"|Bar\n! style=\"background: Silver\" | Key\n! style=\"background: Silver\" | Stanza\n! style=\"background: Silver\" | Description\n|-\n|1\n|1{{refn|group=n|The second column of bar numbers refers to the editions in which the finale is subdivided.

Japanese orchestras, notably the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], began performing the symphony in 1925 and during World War II, the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial government]] promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve. In an effort to capitalize on its popularity, orchestras and choruses undergoing economic hard times during Japan's reconstruction, performed the piece at year's end. In the 1960s, these year-end performances of the symphony became more widespread, and included the participation of local choirs and orchestras, firmly establishing a tradition that continues today.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Curse of the ninth]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* {{Cite book|title=Beethoven: Symphony No. 9|last=Cook|first=Nicholas |author-link=Nicholas Cook|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-521-39039-7|location=Cambridge|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Hopkins|year=1981|title=The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven|location=London|publisher=Heinemann|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|authorlink=David Benjamin Levy|last=Levy|first=David Benjamin|title=Beethoven: the Ninth Symphony|edition=revised|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Makell|first=Talli|chapter=Ludwig van Beethoven|title=Classical Music: The Listener's Companion|editor=Alexander J.

It is known as one of the best schools in Kolkata. It is also known for it's huge playground.\nThe school was started in 1810 in Baithakhana as an elementary school which later came to be known as St. John Chrysostom School. It was re-founded in January 1937 by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Fr. Lawrence Rodriques as St. Lawrence High School. Around 2,300 students were enrolled.\n\n== History ==\nSt.Lawrence High School traces its roots to an elementary school at the Church of Our Lady of Dolours at Baithakkhana, [[Sealdah railway station|Sealdah]], in 1810. In 1855 it was known as St. [[John Chrysostom]]\u2019s School and prepared students for the Lower Primary Examination. In 1902 it became the site of St. Ann\u2019s Orphanage and included Upper Primary School; teaching was in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] but instruction in English was included. In 1913 teaching turned to English and boys were prepared for the [[Senior Cambridge|Junior Cambridge]] Course. In 1920 the [[University of Calcutta]] recognized Chrysostom as a high school, with its first graduation in 1922. At that time the school at 126 Bow Bazar Street occupied one floor of a building that had a printery on the ground floor and the top floor housed boarders; it had no playground. In the 1930s Fr. Lawrence Rodriques S.J. held Sunday raffles to purchase [[St. Xavier's College, Kolkata|St. Xavier's College]] land at [[Ballygunge]]. In January 1937 he was able to open a large new school there, featuring tall eucalyptus trees, a flower garden, and playground. Rodrigues rechristened the school after his namesake, [[Lawrence of Rome]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://stlawrencehighschool.edu.in/historyoftheschool|title=History|website=stlawrencehighschool.edu.in|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s saw the addition of a primary school block and Jesuit residence, and a [[National Cadet Corps (India)|National Cadet Corps]] Air Wing arrived on campus. In 1976 the Higher Secondary Department was opened with majors in commerce and in science. In 1981 the boarding school, formerly on the top floor of the school, was built on the site of the former swimming pool, and the chapel moved to that building. In 1984 the school library was opened and two years later a special computer room. In 2014 Wavreil conference and meeting hall was added.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school maintains as a goal to uplift the poor, to show equal respect for all castes, creeds, and social strata, and to promote unity in diversity.<ref name=\":0\" /> It would implement the Jesuit ideal of forming \"persons for and with others.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onlineministries.creighton.edu/CollaborativeMinistry/men-for-others.html|title=Men for Others|website=onlineministries.creighton.edu|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref>\n\n== Programmes ==\nSt. Lawrence is a private, unaided, primary through higher secondary school for boys, with English as the medium of instruction.

It was re-founded in January 1937 by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Fr. Lawrence Rodriques as St. Lawrence High School. Around 2,300 students were enrolled.\n\n== History ==\nSt.Lawrence High School traces its roots to an elementary school at the Church of Our Lady of Dolours at Baithakkhana, [[Sealdah railway station|Sealdah]], in 1810. In 1855 it was known as St. [[John Chrysostom]]\u2019s School and prepared students for the Lower Primary Examination. In 1902 it became the site of St. Ann\u2019s Orphanage and included Upper Primary School; teaching was in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] but instruction in English was included. In 1913 teaching turned to English and boys were prepared for the [[Senior Cambridge|Junior Cambridge]] Course. In 1920 the [[University of Calcutta]] recognized Chrysostom as a high school, with its first graduation in 1922. At that time the school at 126 Bow Bazar Street occupied one floor of a building that had a printery on the ground floor and the top floor housed boarders; it had no playground. In the 1930s Fr. Lawrence Rodriques S.J. held Sunday raffles to purchase [[St. Xavier's College, Kolkata|St. Xavier's College]] land at [[Ballygunge]]. In January 1937 he was able to open a large new school there, featuring tall eucalyptus trees, a flower garden, and playground. Rodrigues rechristened the school after his namesake, [[Lawrence of Rome]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://stlawrencehighschool.edu.in/historyoftheschool|title=History|website=stlawrencehighschool.edu.in|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s saw the addition of a primary school block and Jesuit residence, and a [[National Cadet Corps (India)|National Cadet Corps]] Air Wing arrived on campus. In 1976 the Higher Secondary Department was opened with majors in commerce and in science. In 1981 the boarding school, formerly on the top floor of the school, was built on the site of the former swimming pool, and the chapel moved to that building. In 1984 the school library was opened and two years later a special computer room. In 2014 Wavreil conference and meeting hall was added.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school maintains as a goal to uplift the poor, to show equal respect for all castes, creeds, and social strata, and to promote unity in diversity.<ref name=\":0\" /> It would implement the Jesuit ideal of forming \"persons for and with others.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onlineministries.creighton.edu/CollaborativeMinistry/men-for-others.html|title=Men for Others|website=onlineministries.creighton.edu|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref>\n\n== Programmes ==\nSt. Lawrence is a private, unaided, primary through higher secondary school for boys, with English as the medium of instruction.
