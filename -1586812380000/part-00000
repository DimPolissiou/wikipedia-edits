In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables.

{"title_page": "Noah Dietrich", "text_new": "{{short description|American business executive and associate of Howard R. Hughes}}\n'''Noah Dietrich''' (February 28, 1889 \u2013 February 15, 1982) was an American businessman, who was the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Howard Hughes]] business empire from 1925 to 1957.<ref name=obit/> (Even though these dates have been recorded as the official period of employment, Noah Dietrich continued to oversee and make executive decisions for the Hughes industries as late as 1970.) According to his own memoirs, he left the Hughes operation over a dispute involving putting more of his income on a [[capital gain]]s basis. The manuscript of his eventual memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', may have been a key, if inadvertent, source of novelist [[Clifford Irving]]'s infamous fake autobiography of Hughes.\n\n==Early life==\nDietrich was born on February 28, 1889 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of German-born evangelical [[Lutheran]] minister John Dietrich, and the former Sarah Peters.<ref>[http://www.noahdietrich.com/bio.html] \"Noah Dietrich was born February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin and was the fourth of six children born to Sarah Peters and German-born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich.\"</ref> He graduated from Janesville High School in 1906, married in 1910, and became a [[bank cashier]] in [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] for the next six months.  They then moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he became an [[auditor]] for the Los Angeles Suburban Land Co., and then the Janass Investment Co.  In 1917, he became an assistant [[comptroller]] for [[Edward L. Doheny]] Oil companies in [[New York City]].  Then Noah, along with his family now consisting of his wife and two daughters, decided to  move back to Los Angeles, where he worked for the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firm of Haskins and Sells. There he passed the [[California Board of Accountancy]] exam in 1923.<ref name=obit/><ref name=\"Noah\">{{cite book |last1=Dietrich |first1=Noah |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |title=Howard, The Amazing Mr. Hughes |date=1972 |publisher=Fawcett Publications, Inc. |location=Greenwich |pages=26-29}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===\"Noah Can Do It\"===\nIn Nov. 1925, at the age of 36, Dietrich met 19-year-old Hughes, who had gained control of [[Hughes Tool Company]] after buying out the other family heirs. Started by his father, [[Howard R. Hughes, Sr.]], Hughes Tool Company&nbsp;\u2013 or Toolco \u2013 manufactured oil drilling equipment, especially the multiple-edge, revolving-teeth roller cutter [[well drilling|drill bits]] the elder Hughes invented.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13-14,22-23,29-30}}\n\nHughes, according to Dietrich, was \"looking for someone with wide general knowledge,\" \"Someone who is resourceful and can solve problems.\"  Questions Hughes asked Dietrich included \"how a battleship finds the range on its target?\", and to \"Explain the principles of the internal combustion engine,\" both of which Dietrich was able to answer satisfactorily.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|23-24}}\n\nDietrich was hired as an executive assistant to explain the production and financial reports issued by Hughes' tool company, eventually becoming Hughes' personal delegate. In his memoir, Dietrich observed that Hughes had little interest in Toolco, other than as a source of revenue. \"The tool company,\" he quoted Hughes as saying, \"was my father's success. And it always will be.\"  The company's earnings, however, allowed Hughes to pursue his interest in Hollywood movies.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|33,76}}\n\nWhen still in his early twenties, Hughes told Dietrich, \"My first objective is to become the world's number one golfer. Second, the top aviator, and third I want to become the world's most famous motion picture producer. Then, I want you to make me the richest man in the world.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|73}} \n\nIn time, Dietrich came to serve as an executive for most of Hughes' enterprises, including [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA),<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|147}} [[RKO Pictures]]<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|237}} and [[Hughes Aircraft]].<ref name=obit/><ref name=Noah/>{{rp|255,257}}\n\nDietrich became Hughes' most indispensable executive&nbsp;\u2013 \"Noah can do it\" was, according to Dietrich's memoir, a frequent Hughes expression whenever difficult, if not impossible, wants or needs needed to be met. Some&nbsp;\u2013 such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home&nbsp;\u2013 were merely difficult.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13}} Others&nbsp;\u2013 such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during [[Prohibition]]&nbsp;\u2013 put him at serious risk.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|90-99}}\n\nDietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus.  Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax.  All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses.  Hughes even said of Dietrich, \"He knows more about my business than I do,\" referring to Noah as a \"genius\".<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|102-104,147,192,254}}\n\nSome of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich&nbsp;\u2013 who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself&nbsp;\u2013 \"of hiding his body and running things\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]] aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|178-181,194-195}}\n\nIn 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco.  Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|190-191}}\n\nDietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of [[Hughes Aircraft]] following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous [[flying boat]], the ''Hercules'', a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]&nbsp;\u2013 whose president, [[Juan Trippe]], had implored Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] to carry it&nbsp;\u2013 pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nDietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him&nbsp;\u2013 and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|207-208}}\n\nBy 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \"immensely onerous\", \"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|253}}\n\n===Falling out with Hughes===\nThough Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder.  Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|22,254,262}}\n\nIn 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership.  At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes.  Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan&nbsp;\u2013 on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit&nbsp;\u2013 stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \"Noah, I can't exist without you!\")<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|15-19,293-294}}\n\nHughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office\u2013 a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships.  Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|295-298}}\n\n===Post-Hughes career and memoirs===\nAfter parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich, as a well-respected financial and executive advisor, served on several corporate and financial boards as well as traveled to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]] (the same illness that killed shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]), did Dietrich finally retire in full.\n\nDietrich wrote of Hughes, \"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him.  He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth.  Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker.  RKO was a heady diversion, an opportunity to pursue his sensual enjoyments.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|290}}\n\n==Personal life==\nBy 1936, he had divorced his first wife, and their two daughters were married.  By 1945, Dietrich had three children with his second wife.  By 1951, Dietrich was separated from his second wife.  After leaving Hughes in 1957, Dietrich married for a third time.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|140,188,257-258,301}}\n\nIn his book ''Howard'', Dietrich wrote, \"I much preferred the more exciting life,\" rather than the sedate life of a CPA.  He wrote the book \"to leave, for my children and grandchildren, a record of the role I played in a colorful subchapter of American history,\" and in part, so \"the American public should be informed on the uses and misuses of great wealth.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|11}}\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905773-1,00.html \"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\"], ''Time''</ref> revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost-written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail. In others, they are substantively the same, although the Irving manuscript has been reworded and otherwise disguised. One curiosity: the writing in the Irving manuscript is much better than that in the hastily drafted Phelan version. It is ironic that Irving may be more convincing as a forger than as an author in his own right&nbsp;\u2013 just as Elmyr de Hory, Irving's [[Ibiza]] friend and the main character in his book Fake!, is much better at doing [[Picasso]]s and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modiglianis]] than he is at doing De Horys.\"  When he later wrote his own memoir, ''The Hoax'', Irving corroborated the hypothesis posited by the ''Time'' article, writing that he indeed obtained and a made a copy of a draft of Dietrich's manuscript, which he then used as source material for his fabricated Hughes autobiography.\n\nDietrich and Phelan eventually settled for $40,000 after Dietrich became dissatisfied with Phelan's work. He then turned the project over to another journalist, [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], who finished the Dietrich memoir within six weeks.\n\n==Death==\nDietrich died of heart failure in hospital on February 15, 1982, in [[Palm Springs, California]].  He was just two weeks short of his ninety-third birthday.<ref name=obit>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/obituaries/noah-dietrich-the-chief-aide-to-howard-hughes-is-dead.html |title=Noah Dietrich, The Chief Aide To Howard Hughes, Is Dead |author=Walter H.

Some&nbsp;\u2013 such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home&nbsp;\u2013 were merely difficult.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13}} Others&nbsp;\u2013 such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during [[Prohibition]]&nbsp;\u2013 put him at serious risk.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|90-99}}\n\nDietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus.  Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax.  All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses.  Hughes even said of Dietrich, \"He knows more about my business than I do,\" referring to Noah as a \"genius\".<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|102-104,147,192,254}}\n\nSome of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich&nbsp;\u2013 who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself&nbsp;\u2013 \"of hiding his body and running things\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]] aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|178-181,194-195}}\n\nIn 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco.  Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|190-191}}\n\nDietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of [[Hughes Aircraft]] following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous [[flying boat]], the ''Hercules'', a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]&nbsp;\u2013 whose president, [[Juan Trippe]], had implored Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] to carry it&nbsp;\u2013 pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nDietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him&nbsp;\u2013 and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|207-208}}\n\nBy 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \"immensely onerous\", \"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|253}}\n\n===Falling out with Hughes===\nThough Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder.  Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|22,254,262}}\n\nIn 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership.  At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes.  Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan&nbsp;\u2013 on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit&nbsp;\u2013 stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \"Noah, I can't exist without you!\")<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|15-19,293-294}}\n\nHughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office\u2013 a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships.  Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|295-298}}\n\n===Post-Hughes career and memoirs===\nAfter parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich, as a well-respected financial and executive advisor, served on several corporate and financial boards as well as traveling to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]] (the same illness that killed shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]), did Dietrich finally retire in full.\n\nDietrich wrote of Hughes, \"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him.  He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth.  Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker.  RKO was a heady diversion, an opportunity to pursue his sensual enjoyments.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|290}}\n\n==Personal life==\nBy 1936, he had divorced his first wife, and their two daughters were married.  By 1945, Dietrich had three children with his second wife.  By 1951, Dietrich was separated from his second wife.  After leaving Hughes in 1957, Dietrich married for a third time.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|140,188,257-258,301}}\n\nIn his book ''Howard'', Dietrich wrote, \"I much preferred the more exciting life,\" rather than the sedate life of a CPA.  He wrote the book \"to leave, for my children and grandchildren, a record of the role I played in a colorful subchapter of American history,\" and in part, so \"the American public should be informed on the uses and misuses of great wealth.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|11}}\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905773-1,00.html \"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\"], ''Time''</ref> revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost-written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail. In others, they are substantively the same, although the Irving manuscript has been reworded and otherwise disguised. One curiosity: the writing in the Irving manuscript is much better than that in the hastily drafted Phelan version. It is ironic that Irving may be more convincing as a forger than as an author in his own right&nbsp;\u2013 just as Elmyr de Hory, Irving's [[Ibiza]] friend and the main character in his book Fake!, is much better at doing [[Picasso]]s and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modiglianis]] than he is at doing De Horys.\"  When he later wrote his own memoir, ''The Hoax'', Irving corroborated the hypothesis posited by the ''Time'' article, writing that he indeed obtained and a made a copy of a draft of Dietrich's manuscript, which he then used as source material for his fabricated Hughes autobiography.\n\nDietrich and Phelan eventually settled for $40,000 after Dietrich became dissatisfied with Phelan's work. He then turned the project over to another journalist, [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], who finished the Dietrich memoir within six weeks.\n\n==Death==\nDietrich died of heart failure in hospital on February 15, 1982, in [[Palm Springs, California]].  He was just two weeks short of his ninety-third birthday.<ref name=obit>{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/obituaries/noah-dietrich-the-chief-aide-to-howard-hughes-is-dead.html |title=Noah Dietrich, The Chief Aide To Howard Hughes, Is Dead |author=Walter H.

He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shah Shuja's step-brother Mahmud Shah had Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=16}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their \"sister\" Wafa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}\n\nShuja allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by France.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=7}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia. According to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], \"The King of Kabul [Shah Shuja] was a handsome man\". He also wrote \"of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely.\" Shuja wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him, but rather undiplomatically described Shuja as having a \"vulgar nose\".{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=6}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja was \"struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe.\"{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be \"about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall\" and his skin colour was \"very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ... The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]].\" He also described Shuja's voice as \"loud and sonorous\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Order of the Durrani Empire]], founded by Shuja Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Mus\u00e9e national de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]\nIn June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811\u20131812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812\u20131813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh .{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}\n\nFrom 1818 onward, Shuja who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}\n\n=== Exile ===\nDuring his time in exile, Shuja indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nIn 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Restoration of power ===\nIn 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be \"dogs\" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of his uncle [[Oosman Khan]] on April 5, 1842{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=304-306}}{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.

The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]].\" He also described Shuja's voice as \"loud and sonorous\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Order of the Durrani Empire]], founded by Shuja Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Mus\u00e9e national de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]\nIn June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811\u20131812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812\u20131813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh .{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}\n\nFrom 1818 onward, Shuja who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}\n\n=== Exile ===\nDuring his time in exile, Shuja indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nIn 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Restoration of power ===\nIn 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be \"dogs\" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of his uncle [[Oosman Khan]] on April 5, 1842{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=304-306}}{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.
