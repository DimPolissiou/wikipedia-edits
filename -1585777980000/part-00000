It played an important role in early [[Islamic history]] and was built in 636. Basra is consistently one of the hottest cities in Iraq, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding {{convert|50|C}}.

In Arabic the word ''ba\u1e63rah'' means \"the overwatcher,\" which might have been an allusion to the city's origin as an Arab military base against the [[Sassanids]]. Others have argued that the name is derived from the [[Aramaic]] word ''basratha'', meaning \"place of huts, settlement.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k1ZQ8LpzOncC&pg=PA9&dq=basra+name&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=tpG9UvONDMXV0QWlsIHoDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBjgK Merchants, Mamluks, and Murder: The Political Economy of Trade in Eighteenth ... \u2013 Thabit Abdullah \u2013 Google Boeken<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Basra}}\n[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q25671.jpg|thumb|Ashar Creek and bazaar, c. 1915]]\n\n===Rashidun Caliphate (632\u2013661)===\nThe city was founded at the beginning of the Islamic era in 636 and began as a garrison encampment for [[Arab]] tribesmen constituting the armies of the [[Rashidun|Rashid Caliph]] [[Umar]]. A [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] a few kilometres south of the present city, still marks the original site which was a military site. While defeating the forces of the [[Sassanid Empire]] there, the Muslim commander [[Utbah ibn Ghazwan]] erected his camp on the site of an old Persian military settlement called ''Vahe\u0161t\u0101b\u0101d Arda\u0161\u012br'', which was destroyed by the Arabs.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'', [[Ehsan Yarshater|E. Yarshater]], [[Columbia University]], p851</ref> The name Al-Basrah, which in Arabic means \"the over watching\" or \"the seeing everything,\" was given to it because of its role as a military base against the [[Sassanid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, other sources claim the name originates from the Persian word Bas-r\u0101h or Bassor\u0101h meaning \"where many ways come together.\"<ref>See Mohammadi Malayeri, M. ''Dil-i Iranshahr''.</ref>\n\nIn 639 Umar established this encampment as a city with five districts, and appointed [[Abu Musa Ashaari|Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]] as its first governor.

In 650, the Rashidun Caliph [[Uthman]] reorganised the Persian frontier, installed \u02bfAbdullah ibn Amir as Basra's governor, and put the military's southern wing under Basra's control. Ibn Amir led his forces to their final victory over [[Yazdegerd III]], the Sassanid [[Shah|King of Kings]].\n\nIn 656, Uthman was murdered and [[Ali]] was appointed Caliph. Ali first installed Uthman ibn Hanif as Basra's governor, who was followed by \u02bfAbdullah ibn \u02bfAbbas. These men held the city for Ali until the latter's death in 661.\n\n===Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750)===\n\n====Sufyanids (661\u2013684)====\nThe [[Sufyanids]] held Basra until [[Yazid I]]'s death in 683. The Sufyanids' first governor was Umayyad \u02bfAbdullah, a renowned military leader, commanding fealty and financial demands from Karballah, but poor governor. In 664, [[Muawiyah I|Mu\u02bfawiyah I]] replaced him with [[Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan]], often called \"ibn Abihi\" (\"son of his own father\"), who became infamous for his draconian rules regarding public order. On Ziyad's death in 673, his son [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad|\u02bfUbaydullah ibn Ziyad]] became governor. In 680, Yazid I ordered \u02bfUbaydullah to keep order in [[Kufa]] as a reaction to [[Hussein ibn Ali]]'s popularity as the grandson of the [[Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. \u02bfUbaydullah took over the control of [[Kufa]]. Hussein sent his cousin as an ambassador to the people of Kufa, but \u02bfUbaydullah executed Hussein's cousin [[Muslim ibn Aqeel]] amid fears of an uprising. \u02bfUbaydullah amassed an army of thousands of soldiers and fought Hussein's army of approximately 70 in a place called [[Karbala]] near Kufa. \u02bfUbaydullah's army was victorious; Hussein and his followers were killed and their heads were sent to Yazid as proof.\n\nIbn al-Harith spent his year in office trying to put down Nafi' ibn al-Azraq's [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] uprising in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]. In 685, Ibn al-Zubayr, requiring a practical ruler, appointed Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar<ref>(Madelung p. 303\u201304)</ref> Finally, Ibn al-Zubayr appointed his own brother Mus'ab. In 686, the revolutionary [[al-Mukhtar]] led an insurrection at Kufa, and put an end to \u02bfUbaydullah ibn Ziyad near [[Mosul]]. In 687, Mus\u02bfab defeated al-Mukhtar with the help of Kufans who Mukhtar exiled.<ref>(Brock p.66)</ref>\n\n====\u02bfAbd al-Malik (685\u2013705)====\n[[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reconquered Basra in 691, and Basra remained loyal to his governor al-Hajjaj during Ibn Ash\u02bfath's mutiny (699\u2013702). However, Basra did support the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against [[Yazid II]] during the 720s.\n\n===Abbasid Caliphate (750\u20131258)===\nIn the 740s, Basra fell to [[as-Saffah]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].  During the time of the Abbasids, Basra became an intellectual centre and home to the elite Basra School of Grammar, the rival and sister school of the Kufa School of Grammar.  Several outstanding intellectuals of the age were Basrans; Arab [[polymath]] [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]], the [[Arabic literature|Arab literary]] giant [[al-Jahiz]], and the [[Sufi]] mystic [[Rabia Basri]]. The [[Zanj Rebellion]] by the agricultural slaves of the lowlands affected the area. In 871, the Zanj sacked Basra.<ref name=AndreWink>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Vol.2, 17. {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> In 923, the [[Qarmatians]], an extremist Muslim sect, invaded and devastated Basra.<ref name=AndreWink />\n\n====Buyid Dynasty (945\u20131055)====\nFrom 945 to 1055, a [[Buyid dynasty]] ruled Baghdad and most of Iraq. Abu al Qasim al-Baridis, who still controlled Basra and [[Wasit]], were defeated and their lands taken by the Buyids in 947. [['Adud al-Dawla|Adud al-Dawla]] and his sons [[Diya' al-Dawla]] and [[Samsam al-Dawla]] were the Buyid rulers of Basra during the 970s, 980s and 990s.  Sanad al-Dawla al-Habashi (ca.921\u2013977), the brother of the Emir of Iraq [[Izz al-Dawla]], was governor of Basra and built a library of 15,000 books.\n\n====Seljuq Dynasty (1055\u20131194)====\nThe Oghuz Turk [[Tughril Beg]] was the leader of the Seljuks, who expelled the [[Shiite]] Buyid dynasty. He was the first Seljuk ruler to style himself Sultan and Protector of the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\n===Islamic Golden Age===\nThe Great Friday Mosque was constructed in Basra. In 1122, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]] received Basra as a fief.<ref>Penny Encyclopedia</ref> In 1126, Zengi suppressed a revolt and in 1129, Dabis looted the Basra state treasury.\nA 1200 map \"on the eve of the Mongol invasions\" shows the Abbasid Caliphate as ruling lower Iraq and, presumably, Basra.\n\nThe [[Order of Assassins|Assassin]] [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan|Rashid-ad-Din-Sinan]] was born in Basra on or between 1131 and 1135.\n\nIn 1258, the Mongols under [[Hulagu Khan|Hulegu Khan]] sacked Baghdad and ended Abbasid rule. By some accounts, Basra capitulated to the Mongols to avoid a massacre. The Mamluk [[Bahri dynasty]] map (1250\u20131382) shows Basra as being under their area of control, and the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Dominions]] map (1300\u20131405) shows Basra as being under ''their'' control.\n\nIn 1290<ref>[[Buscarello de Ghizolfi]]</ref> fighting erupted at the Persian Gulf port of Basra among the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph and the Ghibelline]] factions.\n\n[[Ibn Battuta]] visited Basra in the 14th century, noting it \"was renowned throughout the whole world, spacious in area and elegant in its courts, remarkable for its numerous fruit-gardens and its choice fruits, since it is the meeting place of the two seas, the salt and the fresh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador |location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=60}}</ref> Ibn Battuta also noted that Basra consisted of three quarters: the Hudayl quarter, the Banu Haram quarter, and the Iranian quarter (''mahallat al-Ajam'').<ref name=\"BasraIranica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = BASRA | last = Donner | first = F.M. | authorlink = Fred Donner | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/basra | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. III, Fasc. 8 | pages = 851\u2013855 | location = | year = 1988 | isbn = }}\n</ref> [[Fred Donner]] adds: \"If the first two reveal that Basra was still predominantly an Arab town, the existence of an Iranian quarter clearly reveals the legacy of long centuries of intimate contact between Basra and the Iranian plateau.\"<ref name=\"BasraIranica\"/>\n\n===Period thereafter===\nThe Arab Al-Mughamis tribe established control over Basra in the early fifteenth century, however, they quickly fell under influence of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]], successively.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}{{efn|The Al-Mughamis were a branch of the [[Al-Muntafiq|Banu'l-Muntafiq]] who inhabited the area between [[Kufa]] and Basra.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}}} The Al-Mughamis' control of Basra had become nominal by 1436; ''de facto'' control of Basra from 1436 to 1508 was in the hands of the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Moshasha]].{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}{{efn|The Moshasha were a tribal confederation of radical [[Shia Islam|Shi'ites]] found mainly on the edges of the marshes alongside the Safavid province of Arabestan (present-day [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]).

In 1550, the Portuguese threatened Basra. In 1624, the Portuguese assisted Basra Pasha in repelling a Persian invasion. The Portuguese were granted a share of customs and freedom from tolls.

Following the four days of bombing in December, the Iraqi government commenced challenging the \"no fly zones\" unilaterally imposed on the country by the United States, following the 1991 Persian Gulf war. During the month of January, 1999, there were more than 100 incursions by Iraqi aircraft and 20 instances of Iraqi surface-to-air missiles being filed. The January bombing of Basra occurred in the context of retaliatory attacks by the United States.}}</ref>\n\nA second revolt in 1999 led to mass executions in and around Basra. Subsequently, the Iraqi government deliberately neglected the city, and much commerce was diverted to [[Umm Qasr]]. These alleged abuses are to feature amongst the charges against the former regime to be considered by the [[Iraq Special Tribunal]] set up by the [[Iraq Interim Government]] following the 2003 invasion.\n\nWorkers in Basra's oil industry have been involved in extensive organization and labour conflict. They held a two-day strike in August 2003, and formed the nucleus of the independent [[General Union of Oil Employees]] (GUOE) in June 2004.

British forces, led by the [[British 7th Armoured Brigade|7th Armoured Brigade]], took the city on 6 April 2003.  This city was the first stop for the United States and the United Kingdom during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nOn 21 April 2004, a [[21 April 2004 Basra bombings|series of bomb blasts]] ripped through the city, killing 74 people. The [[Multi-National Division (South-East) (Iraq)|Multi-National Division (South-East)]], under British Command, was engaged in Security and Stabilization missions in [[Basra Governorate]] and surrounding areas during this time.  Political groups centred in Basra were reported to have close links with political parties already in power in the [[government of Iraq|Iraqi government]], despite opposition from Iraqi [[Sunni]]s and the more secular [[Kurd]]s. January 2005 elections saw several radical politicians gain office, supported by religious parties.

The Shatt-Al-Arab and Basra waterways define the eastern and western borders of Basra, respectively. The city is penetrated by a complex network of canals and streams, vital for irrigation and other agricultural use. These canals were once used to transport goods and people throughout the city, but during the last two decades, pollution and a continuous drop in water levels have made river navigation impossible in the canals. Basra is roughly {{convert|110|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from the Persian Gulf.\n\n==Climate==\nBasra has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), like the rest of the surrounding region, though it receives slightly more [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] than inland locations due to its location near the coast. During the summer months, from June to August, Basra is consistently one of the hottest cities on the planet, with temperatures regularly exceeding {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in July and August. In winter Basra experiences mild weather with average high temperatures around {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. On some winter nights, minimum temperatures are below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. High humidity \u2013 sometimes exceeding 90% \u2013 is common due to the proximity to the marshy Persian Gulf.\n\nAn all-time high temperature was recorded on July 22, 2016, when daytime readings soared to {{convert|53.8|\u00b0C|1}}. This is one of the hottest temperatures ever measured on the planet. The following night, the night time low temperature was {{convert|38.8|\u00b0C|1}}, which was one of the highest minimum temperatures on any given day, only outshone by Khasab, Oman and Death Valley, California, USA.  The lowest temperature ever recorded in Basra was {{convert|-4.7|\u00b0C|1}} on January 22, 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iraqi Meteorological Department, 1970|url=ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/docs.lib/htdocs/rescue/cd374_pdf/LSN3407.PDF |publisher=Iraqi Meteorological Department |date=1970}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|location=Basra\n|Jan record high C=34\n|Feb record high C=29\n|Mar record high C=39\n|Apr record high C=42\n|May record high C=48\n|Jun record high C=51\n|Jul record high C=53.8\n|Aug record high C=51\n|Sep record high C=49\n|Oct record high C=46\n|Nov record high C=37\n|Dec record high C=30\n\n|Jan high C=17.7\n|Feb high C=20.0\n|Mar high C=24.5\n|Apr high C=30.6\n|May high C=36.8\n|Jun high C=39.7\n|Jul high C=41.3\n|Aug high C=41.8\n|Sep high C=39.9\n|Oct high C=34.9\n|Nov high C=27.1\n|Dec high C=20.3\n\n|Jan mean C=12.2\n|Feb mean C=14.2\n|Mar mean C=18.3\n|Apr mean C=23.9\n|May mean C=30.2\n|Jun mean C=32.9\n|Jul mean C=34.3\n|Aug mean C=33.9\n|Sep mean C=31.2\n|Oct mean C=26.4\n|Nov mean C=20.4\n|Dec mean C=14.5\n\n|Jan low C=6.8\n|Feb low C=8.4\n|Mar low C=12.2\n|Apr low C=17.2\n|May low C=23.6\n|Jun low C=26.2\n|Jul low C=27.4\n|Aug low C=26.1\n|Sep low C=22.6\n|Oct low C=18.0\n|Nov low C=13.7\n|Dec low C=8.7\n\n|Jan record low C=-4.7\n|Feb record low C=-4\n|Mar record low C=1.9\n|Apr record low C=2.8\n|May record low C=8.2\n|Jun record low C=18.2\n|Jul record low C=22.2\n|Aug record low C=20\n|Sep record low C=13.1\n|Oct record low C=6.1\n|Nov record low C=1\n|Dec record low C=-2.6\n\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=31\n|Feb precipitation mm=21\n|Mar precipitation mm=19\n|Apr precipitation mm=17\n|May precipitation mm=5\n|Jun precipitation mm=0\n|Jul precipitation mm=0\n|Aug precipitation mm=0\n|Sep precipitation mm=0\n|Oct precipitation mm=3\n|Nov precipitation mm=23\n|Dec precipitation mm=33\n\n|Jan rain days=6\n|Feb rain days=5\n|Mar rain days=5\n|Apr rain days=4\n|May rain days=2\n|Jun rain days=0\n|Jul rain days=0\n|Aug rain days=0\n|Sep rain days=0\n|Oct rain days=1\n|Nov rain days=4\n|Dec rain days=5\n\n|Jan sun=186\n|Feb sun=198\n|Mar sun=217\n|Apr sun=248\n|May sun=279\n|Jun sun=330\n|Jul sun=341\n|Aug sun=310\n|Sep sun=300\n|Oct sun=279\n|Nov sun=210\n|Dec sun=186\n\n|Jand sun=6\n|Febd sun=7\n|Mard sun=7\n|Aprd sun=8\n|Mayd sun=9\n|Jund sun=11\n|Juld sun=11\n|Augd sun=10\n|Sepd sun=10\n|Octd sun=9\n|Novd sun=7\n|Decd sun=6\n\n| source 1 = ''Climate-Data.org''<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate: Basra \u2013 Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/4555/ |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n| source 2 = ''Weather2Travel'' for rainy days and sunshine<ref>{{cite web|title=Basra Climate and Weather Averages, Iraq |url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/iraq/basra.php |publisher=Weather2Travel |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Church-In Basra-Iraq \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Chaldean Catholic]] Church in Basra.]]\nIn Basra the vast majority of the population are ethnic [[Arabs]] of the [[Adnanite]] or the [[Qahtanite]] tribes. The tribes located in Basra include Al-Emarah, [[Bani Mansour]], [[Dulaim]], [[Shammar]], [[Jubur]], [[Bani Tamim]], [[Bani Malik (tribe)|Bani Malik]], [[Zubaid]], [[Al-shwelat]], [[Suwa'id]], [[Al-bo Mohammed]], [[Al-Badr (tribe)|Al-Badr]], [[Al-Ubadi]], [[Ruba'ah Sayyid]] tribes (descendants of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammed]]) and other Arab tribes.\n\nIn addition to the Arabs, there is also a community of [[Afro-Iraqi]] peoples, known as [[Zanj]]. The Zanj are a Muslim Ethnic group living in Iraq and are a mix of African peoples taken from the coast of the area of modern-day [[Kenya]] as slaves in the 900s. They now number around 200,000 in [[Iraq]].\n\n===Religion===\nBasra is a major Shia city, with the old [[Akhbari]] Shiism progressively being overwhelmed by the [[Usuli]] Shiism. The Sunni population is tiny and dropping in their percentage as more Iraqi Shias move into Basra for various job or welfare opportunities. The satellite town of [[Az Zubayr]] in the direction of Kuwait was a Sunni town, but the burgeoning population of Basra has spilled over into Zubair, turning it into an extension of Basra with a slight Shia majority as well.\n\n[[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrians]] were recorded in the Ottoman census as early as 1911, and a small number of them live in Basra. However, a significant number of the modern community are refugees fleeing persecution from ISIS in the [[Nineveh Plains]], Mosul, and northern Iraq. But ever since the liberation of ISIS in Iraq many Christians have returned to their Homeland in the Nineveh plains. In 2018 there are about a few thousand Christians in Basra. One of the largest communities of pre-Islamic [[Mandaeans]] live in the city, whose headquarters was in the area formerly called Suk esh-Sheikh.\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Imam Ali Mosque in Basra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Imam Ali Mosque (Basra)|Ali Bin Abi Talib mosque]]]]\n[[File:Basrah corniche.JPG|thumb|right|[[Shatt Al-Arab]]]]\n[[File:Basrah.JPG|thumb|right|Old Basrah]]\n[[File:Bridge of Basra 1.jpg|thumb|right|Muhhmad Baquir Al-Sadr Bridge]]\n\n* The [[Imam Ali Mosque (Basra)|old mosque of Basra]], the first mosque in Islam outside the Arabian peninsula.\n* Sinbad Island is located in the centre of Shatt Al-Arab, near the Miinaalmakl, and extends above the bridge Khaled and is a tourist landmark.\n* The Muhhmad Baquir Al-Sadr Bridge, at the union of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, was completed in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.maegspa.com/en/portfolio/muhhmad-baquir-al-sadr-bridge | title=Maeg - Building ideas}}</ref>\n* Sayab's House Ruins is the site of the most famous home of the poet [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]].

The Southern Fertilizer Company produces ammonia solution, [[urea]] and [[nitrogen]] gas, while the SCPI focus on such products as [[ethylene]], caustic/chlorine, [[vinyl chloride monomer]] (VCM), [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[low-density polyethylene]], and [[high-density polyethylene]].\n\nBasra is in a fertile agricultural region, with major products including rice, [[maize|maize corn]], [[barley]], [[pearl millet]], wheat, [[date (fruit)|dates]], and livestock. For a long time, Basra was known for the superior quality of its dates.<ref name=EB1911/> Basra was known in the 1960s for its sugar market, a fact that figured heavily in the [[English contract law]] remoteness of damages case [[The Heron II]] [1969] 1 AC 350.\n\nShipping, logistics and transport are also major industries in Basra. Basra is home to all of Iraq's six ports; [[Umm Qasr]] is the main deep-water port with 22 platforms, some of which are dedicated to specific goods (such as sulphur, seeds, lubricant oil, etc.) The other five ports are smaller in scale and more narrowly specialized. Fishing was an important business before the oil boom.

It played an important role in early [[Islamic history]] and was built in 636. Basra is consistently one of the hottest cities in Iraq, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding {{convert|50|C}}. In April 2017, the [[Iraqi Parliament]] recognized Basra as Iraq's economic capital.<ref name=\"Iraqi Parliament passes motion\">{{cite web|title=Iraqi parliament recognizes Basra as economic capital|url=https://search4dinar.wordpress.com/2017/04/27/iraqi-parliament-recognizes-basra-as-economic-capital/}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:AMH-5342-NA View of Basra and 'Gordelaan' castle.jpg|thumb|right|View of Basra in circa 1695, by Dutch cartographer [[Isaak de Graaf]]]]\n\nThe city was called by many names throughout its history, Basrah being the most common. In Arabic the word ''ba\u1e63rah'' means \"the overwatcher,\" which might have been an allusion to the city's origin as an Arab military base against the [[Sassanids]]. Others have argued that the name is derived from the [[Aramaic]] word ''basratha'', meaning \"place of huts, settlement.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k1ZQ8LpzOncC&pg=PA9&dq=basra+name&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=tpG9UvONDMXV0QWlsIHoDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBjgK Merchants, Mamluks, and Murder: The Political Economy of Trade in Eighteenth ... \u2013 Thabit Abdullah \u2013 Google Boeken<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Basra}}\n[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q25671.jpg|thumb|Ashar Creek and bazaar, c. 1915]]\n\n===Rashidun Caliphate (632\u2013661)===\nThe city was founded at the beginning of the Islamic era in 636 and began as a garrison encampment for [[Arab]] tribesmen constituting the armies of the [[Rashidun|Rashid Caliph]] [[Umar]]. A [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] a few kilometres south of the present city, still marks the original site which was a military site. While defeating the forces of the [[Sassanid Empire]] there, the Muslim commander [[Utbah ibn Ghazwan]] erected his camp on the site of an old Persian military settlement called ''Vahe\u0161t\u0101b\u0101d Arda\u0161\u012br'', which was destroyed by the Arabs.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'', [[Ehsan Yarshater|E. Yarshater]], [[Columbia University]], p851</ref> The name Al-Basrah, which in Arabic means \"the over watching\" or \"the seeing everything,\" was given to it because of its role as a military base against the [[Sassanid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, other sources claim the name originates from the Persian word Bas-r\u0101h or Bassor\u0101h meaning \"where many ways come together.\"<ref>See Mohammadi Malayeri, M. ''Dil-i Iranshahr''.</ref>\n\nIn 639 Umar established this encampment as a city with five districts, and appointed [[Abu Musa Ashaari|Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]] as its first governor. The city was built in a circular plan according to the [[Sasanian architecture|Partho-Sasanian architecture]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arce |first1=Ignacio |title=Umayyad Building Techniques and the Merging of Roman-Byzantine and Partho-Sassanian Traditions: Continuity and Change |journal=Late Antique Archaeology |date=1 January 2008 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=494\u2013495 |doi=10.1163/22134522-90000099 |language=en |issn=1570-6893}}</ref> Abu Musa led the conquest of [[Khuzestan]] from 639 to 642 and was ordered by Umar to aid [[Uthman ibn Abi al-As]], then fighting Iran from a new, more easterly ''mi\u1e63r'' at [[Tawwaj]].  In 650, the Rashidun Caliph [[Uthman]] reorganised the Persian frontier, installed \u02bfAbdullah ibn Amir as Basra's governor, and put the military's southern wing under Basra's control. Ibn Amir led his forces to their final victory over [[Yazdegerd III]], the Sassanid [[Shah|King of Kings]].\n\nIn 656, Uthman was murdered and [[Ali]] was appointed Caliph. Ali first installed Uthman ibn Hanif as Basra's governor, who was followed by \u02bfAbdullah ibn \u02bfAbbas. These men held the city for Ali until the latter's death in 661.\n\n===Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750)===\n\n====Sufyanids (661\u2013684)====\nThe [[Sufyanids]] held Basra until [[Yazid I]]'s death in 683. The Sufyanids' first governor was Umayyad \u02bfAbdullah, a renowned military leader, commanding fealty and financial demands from Karballah, but poor governor. In 664, [[Muawiyah I|Mu\u02bfawiyah I]] replaced him with [[Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan]], often called \"ibn Abihi\" (\"son of his own father\"), who became infamous for his draconian rules regarding public order. On Ziyad's death in 673, his son [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad|\u02bfUbaydullah ibn Ziyad]] became governor. In 680, Yazid I ordered \u02bfUbaydullah to keep order in [[Kufa]] as a reaction to [[Hussein ibn Ali]]'s popularity as the grandson of the [[Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. \u02bfUbaydullah took over the control of [[Kufa]]. Hussein sent his cousin as an ambassador to the people of Kufa, but \u02bfUbaydullah executed Hussein's cousin [[Muslim ibn Aqeel]] amid fears of an uprising. \u02bfUbaydullah amassed an army of thousands of soldiers and fought Hussein's army of approximately 70 in a place called [[Karbala]] near Kufa. \u02bfUbaydullah's army was victorious; Hussein and his followers were killed and their heads were sent to Yazid as proof.\n\nIbn al-Harith spent his year in office trying to put down Nafi' ibn al-Azraq's [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] uprising in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]. In 685, Ibn al-Zubayr, requiring a practical ruler, appointed Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar<ref>(Madelung p. 303\u201304)</ref> Finally, Ibn al-Zubayr appointed his own brother Mus'ab. In 686, the revolutionary [[al-Mukhtar]] led an insurrection at Kufa, and put an end to \u02bfUbaydullah ibn Ziyad near [[Mosul]]. In 687, Mus\u02bfab defeated al-Mukhtar with the help of Kufans who Mukhtar exiled.<ref>(Brock p.66)</ref>\n\n====\u02bfAbd al-Malik (685\u2013705)====\n[[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reconquered Basra in 691, and Basra remained loyal to his governor al-Hajjaj during Ibn Ash\u02bfath's mutiny (699\u2013702). However, Basra did support the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against [[Yazid II]] during the 720s.\n\n===Abbasid Caliphate (750\u20131258)===\nIn the 740s, Basra fell to [[as-Saffah]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].  During the time of the Abbasids, Basra became an intellectual centre and home to the elite Basra School of Grammar, the rival and sister school of the Kufa School of Grammar.  Several outstanding intellectuals of the age were Basrans; Arab [[polymath]] [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]], the [[Arabic literature|Arab literary]] giant [[al-Jahiz]], and the [[Sufi]] mystic [[Rabia Basri]]. The [[Zanj Rebellion]] by the agricultural slaves of the lowlands affected the area. In 871, the Zanj sacked Basra.<ref name=AndreWink>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Vol.2, 17. {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> In 923, the [[Qarmatians]], an extremist Muslim sect, invaded and devastated Basra.<ref name=AndreWink />\n\n====Buyid Dynasty (945\u20131055)====\nFrom 945 to 1055, a [[Buyid dynasty]] ruled Baghdad and most of Iraq. Abu al Qasim al-Baridis, who still controlled Basra and [[Wasit]], were defeated and their lands taken by the Buyids in 947. [['Adud al-Dawla|Adud al-Dawla]] and his sons [[Diya' al-Dawla]] and [[Samsam al-Dawla]] were the Buyid rulers of Basra during the 970s, 980s and 990s.  Sanad al-Dawla al-Habashi (ca.921\u2013977), the brother of the Emir of Iraq [[Izz al-Dawla]], was governor of Basra and built a library of 15,000 books.\n\n====Seljuq Dynasty (1055\u20131194)====\nThe Oghuz Turk [[Tughril Beg]] was the leader of the Seljuks, who expelled the [[Shiite]] Buyid dynasty. He was the first Seljuk ruler to style himself Sultan and Protector of the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\n===Islamic Golden Age===\nThe Great Friday Mosque was constructed in Basra. In 1122, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]] received Basra as a fief.<ref>Penny Encyclopedia</ref> In 1126, Zengi suppressed a revolt and in 1129, Dabis looted the Basra state treasury.\nA 1200 map \"on the eve of the Mongol invasions\" shows the Abbasid Caliphate as ruling lower Iraq and, presumably, Basra.\n\nThe [[Order of Assassins|Assassin]] [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan|Rashid-ad-Din-Sinan]] was born in Basra on or between 1131 and 1135.\n\nIn 1258, the Mongols under [[Hulagu Khan|Hulegu Khan]] sacked Baghdad and ended Abbasid rule. By some accounts, Basra capitulated to the Mongols to avoid a massacre. The Mamluk [[Bahri dynasty]] map (1250\u20131382) shows Basra as being under their area of control, and the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Dominions]] map (1300\u20131405) shows Basra as being under ''their'' control.\n\nIn 1290<ref>[[Buscarello de Ghizolfi]]</ref> fighting erupted at the Persian Gulf port of Basra among the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph and the Ghibelline]] factions.\n\n[[Ibn Battuta]] visited Basra in the 14th century, noting it \"was renowned throughout the whole world, spacious in area and elegant in its courts, remarkable for its numerous fruit-gardens and its choice fruits, since it is the meeting place of the two seas, the salt and the fresh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador |location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=60}}</ref> Ibn Battuta also noted that Basra consisted of three quarters: the Hudayl quarter, the Banu Haram quarter, and the Iranian quarter (''mahallat al-Ajam'').<ref name=\"BasraIranica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = BASRA | last = Donner | first = F.M. | authorlink = Fred Donner | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/basra | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. III, Fasc. 8 | pages = 851\u2013855 | location = | year = 1988 | isbn = }}\n</ref> [[Fred Donner]] adds: \"If the first two reveal that Basra was still predominantly an Arab town, the existence of an Iranian quarter clearly reveals the legacy of long centuries of intimate contact between Basra and the Iranian plateau.\"<ref name=\"BasraIranica\"/>\n\n===Period thereafter===\nThe Arab Al-Mughamis tribe established control over Basra in the early fifteenth century, however, they quickly fell under influence of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]], successively.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}{{efn|The Al-Mughamis were a branch of the [[Al-Muntafiq|Banu'l-Muntafiq]] who inhabited the area between [[Kufa]] and Basra.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}}} The Al-Mughamis' control of Basra had become nominal by 1436; ''de facto'' control of Basra from 1436 to 1508 was in the hands of the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Moshasha]].{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}{{efn|The Moshasha were a tribal confederation of radical [[Shia Islam|Shi'ites]] found mainly on the edges of the marshes alongside the Safavid province of Arabestan (present-day [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]).

This resulted in tighter (but still, nominal) Ottoman control over Basra.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b|pages=556\u2013560, 561}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=53}}\n\nIn 1523, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] under the command of Ant\u00f3nio Tenreiro crossed from Aleppo to Basra. In 1550, the Portuguese threatened Basra. In 1624, the Portuguese assisted Basra Pasha in repelling a Persian invasion. The Portuguese were granted a share of customs and freedom from tolls. From about 1625 until 1668, Basra and the Delta marshlands were in the hands of local chieftains independent of the Ottoman administration at Baghdad.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n{{see also|Basra Eyalet|Basra Vilayet}}\n[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q25704.jpg|thumb|Iraqi girls, c. 1917]]\nBasra was, for a long time, a flourishing commercial and cultural centre.

General [[Anthony Zinni]], then commander of US forces in the Persian Gulf, acknowledged that it was possible that \"a missile may have been errant.\" While such casualty numbers pale in comparison to later events, the bombing occurred one day after Arab foreign ministers, meeting in Egypt, refused to condemn four days of air strikes against Iraq in December 1998.

The January bombing of Basra occurred in the context of retaliatory attacks by the United States.}}</ref>\n\nA second revolt in 1999 led to mass executions in and around Basra. Subsequently, the Iraqi government deliberately neglected the city, and much commerce was diverted to [[Umm Qasr]]. These alleged abuses are to feature amongst the charges against the former regime to be considered by the [[Iraq Special Tribunal]] set up by the [[Iraq Interim Government]] following the 2003 invasion.\n\nWorkers in Basra's oil industry have been involved in extensive organization and labour conflict. They held a two-day strike in August 2003, and formed the nucleus of the independent [[General Union of Oil Employees]] (GUOE) in June 2004. The union held a one-day strike in July 2005, and publicly opposes plans for privatizing the industry.\n\n====2003\u201307: Iraq War and occupation====\n{{Main|Battle of Basra (2003)}}\n\nIn March through to May 2003, the outskirts of Basra were the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. British forces, led by the [[British 7th Armoured Brigade|7th Armoured Brigade]], took the city on 6 April 2003.  This city was the first stop for the United States and the United Kingdom during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nOn 21 April 2004, a [[21 April 2004 Basra bombings|series of bomb blasts]] ripped through the city, killing 74 people. The [[Multi-National Division (South-East) (Iraq)|Multi-National Division (South-East)]], under British Command, was engaged in Security and Stabilization missions in [[Basra Governorate]] and surrounding areas during this time.  Political groups centred in Basra were reported to have close links with political parties already in power in the [[government of Iraq|Iraqi government]], despite opposition from Iraqi [[Sunni]]s and the more secular [[Kurd]]s. January 2005 elections saw several radical politicians gain office, supported by religious parties.

The Shatt-Al-Arab and Basra waterways define the eastern and western borders of Basra, respectively. The city is penetrated by a complex network of canals and streams, vital for irrigation and other agricultural use. These canals were once used to transport goods and people throughout the city, but during the last two decades, pollution and a continuous drop in water levels have made river navigation impossible in the canals. Basra is roughly {{convert|110|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from the Persian Gulf.\n\n==Climate==\nBasra has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), like the rest of the surrounding region, though it receives slightly more [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] than inland locations due to its location near the coast. During the summer months, from June to August, Basra is consistently one of the hottest cities on the planet, with temperatures regularly exceeding {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in July and August. In winter Basra experiences mild weather with average high temperatures around {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. On some winter nights, minimum temperatures are below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. High humidity \u2013 sometimes exceeding 90% \u2013 is common due to the proximity to the marshy Persian Gulf.\n\nAn all-time high temperature was recorded on July 22, 2016, when daytime readings soared to {{convert|53.8|\u00b0C|1}}. This is one of the hottest temperatures ever measured on the planet. The following night, the night time low temperature was {{convert|38.8|\u00b0C|1}}, which was one of the highest minimum temperatures on any given day, only outshone by Khasab, Oman and Death Valley, California, USA.  The lowest temperature ever recorded in Basra was {{convert|-4.7|\u00b0C|1}} on January 22, 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iraqi Meteorological Department, 1970|url=ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/docs.lib/htdocs/rescue/cd374_pdf/LSN3407.PDF |publisher=Iraqi Meteorological Department |date=1970}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|location=Basra\n|Jan record high C=34\n|Feb record high C=29\n|Mar record high C=39\n|Apr record high C=42\n|May record high C=48\n|Jun record high C=51\n|Jul record high C=53.8\n|Aug record high C=51\n|Sep record high C=49\n|Oct record high C=46\n|Nov record high C=37\n|Dec record high C=30\n\n|Jan high C=17.7\n|Feb high C=20.0\n|Mar high C=24.5\n|Apr high C=30.6\n|May high C=36.8\n|Jun high C=39.7\n|Jul high C=41.3\n|Aug high C=41.8\n|Sep high C=39.9\n|Oct high C=34.9\n|Nov high C=27.1\n|Dec high C=20.3\n\n|Jan mean C=12.2\n|Feb mean C=14.2\n|Mar mean C=18.3\n|Apr mean C=23.9\n|May mean C=30.2\n|Jun mean C=32.9\n|Jul mean C=34.3\n|Aug mean C=33.9\n|Sep mean C=31.2\n|Oct mean C=26.4\n|Nov mean C=20.4\n|Dec mean C=14.5\n\n|Jan low C=6.8\n|Feb low C=8.4\n|Mar low C=12.2\n|Apr low C=17.2\n|May low C=23.6\n|Jun low C=26.2\n|Jul low C=27.4\n|Aug low C=26.1\n|Sep low C=22.6\n|Oct low C=18.0\n|Nov low C=13.7\n|Dec low C=8.7\n\n|Jan record low C=-4.7\n|Feb record low C=-4\n|Mar record low C=1.9\n|Apr record low C=2.8\n|May record low C=8.2\n|Jun record low C=18.2\n|Jul record low C=22.2\n|Aug record low C=20\n|Sep record low C=13.1\n|Oct record low C=6.1\n|Nov record low C=1\n|Dec record low C=-2.6\n\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=31\n|Feb precipitation mm=21\n|Mar precipitation mm=19\n|Apr precipitation mm=17\n|May precipitation mm=5\n|Jun precipitation mm=0\n|Jul precipitation mm=0\n|Aug precipitation mm=0\n|Sep precipitation mm=0\n|Oct precipitation mm=3\n|Nov precipitation mm=23\n|Dec precipitation mm=33\n\n|Jan rain days=6\n|Feb rain days=5\n|Mar rain days=5\n|Apr rain days=4\n|May rain days=2\n|Jun rain days=0\n|Jul rain days=0\n|Aug rain days=0\n|Sep rain days=0\n|Oct rain days=1\n|Nov rain days=4\n|Dec rain days=5\n\n|Jan sun=186\n|Feb sun=198\n|Mar sun=217\n|Apr sun=248\n|May sun=279\n|Jun sun=330\n|Jul sun=341\n|Aug sun=310\n|Sep sun=300\n|Oct sun=279\n|Nov sun=210\n|Dec sun=186\n\n|Jand sun=6\n|Febd sun=7\n|Mard sun=7\n|Aprd sun=8\n|Mayd sun=9\n|Jund sun=11\n|Juld sun=11\n|Augd sun=10\n|Sepd sun=10\n|Octd sun=9\n|Novd sun=7\n|Decd sun=6\n\n| source 1 = ''Climate-Data.org''<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate: Basra \u2013 Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/4555/ |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n| source 2 = ''Weather2Travel'' for rainy days and sunshine<ref>{{cite web|title=Basra Climate and Weather Averages, Iraq |url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/iraq/basra.php |publisher=Weather2Travel |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Church-In Basra-Iraq \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Chaldean Catholic]] Church in Basra.]]\nIn Basra the vast majority of the population are ethnic [[Arabs]] of the [[Adnanite]] or the [[Qahtanite]] tribes.

The Zanj are a Muslim Ethnic group living in Iraq and are a mix of African peoples taken from the coast of the area of modern-day [[Kenya]] as slaves in the 900s. They now number around 200,000 in [[Iraq]].\n\n===Religion===\nBasra is a major Shia city, with the old [[Akhbari]] Shiism progressively being overwhelmed by the [[Usuli]] Shiism. The Sunni population is tiny and dropping in their percentage as more Iraqi Shias move into Basra for various job or welfare opportunities. The satellite town of [[Az Zubayr]] in the direction of Kuwait was a Sunni town, but the burgeoning population of Basra has spilled over into Zubair, turning it into an extension of Basra with a slight Shia majority as well.\n\n[[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrians]] were recorded in the Ottoman census as early as 1911, and a small number of them live in Basra. However, a significant number of the modern community are refugees fleeing persecution from ISIS in the [[Nineveh Plains]], Mosul, and northern Iraq. But ever since the liberation of ISIS in Iraq many Christians have returned to their Homeland in the Nineveh plains. In 2018 there are about a few thousand Christians in Basra.

Basra is home to all of Iraq's six ports; [[Umm Qasr]] is the main deep-water port with 22 platforms, some of which are dedicated to specific goods (such as sulphur, seeds, lubricant oil, etc.) The other five ports are smaller in scale and more narrowly specialized.

{"title_page": "History of the Basques", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Short description|ethnic history}}\n{{Basque culture}}\n{{History of the Basque people}}\nThe [[Basques]] ({{lang-eu|Euskaldunak}}) are an indigenous ethno-linguistic group mainly inhabiting [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (adjacent areas of [[Spain]] and [[France]]). Their history is therefore interconnected with Spanish and French history and also with the history of many other past and present countries, particularly in Europe and the [[Americas]], where a large number of [[Basque diaspora|their descendants]] keep attached to their roots, clustering around [[Basque center|Basque clubs]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|Origin of the Basques}}\n\n===First historical references===\n[[Image:Basque tribes.gif|thumb|right|250px|Location of the ancient tribes<br /> \u00b7Red: Theorized as Basque, [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes<br /> \u00b7Blue: Proven [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes]]\n\nIn the 1st century, [[Strabo]] wrote that the northern parts of what are now [[Navarre]] (''Nafarroa'' in Basque) and [[Aragon]] were inhabited by the [[Vascones]]. Despite the evident etymological connection between ''Vascones'' and the modern denomination ''Basque'', there is no direct proof that the Vascones were the modern Basques' ancestors or spoke the language that has evolved into modern [[Basque language|Basque]], although this is strongly suggested both by the historically consistent toponymy of the area and by a few personal names on tombstones dating from the Roman period.\n\nThree different peoples inhabited the territory of the present [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]]: the [[Varduli]], [[Caristii]] and [[Autrigones]]. Historical sources do not state whether these tribes were related to the [[Vascones]], the [[Aquitani]], pre-indoeuropean people or the [[Celts]]. The area where a Basque-related language is best attested from an early period is [[Gascony]] in France, to the north of the present-day Basque region, whose ancient inhabitants, the [[Aquitani]], spoke a language related to Basque.{{Efn|The extinct [[Aquitanian language]] should not be confused with [[Gascon language|Gascon]], the Romance language that has been spoken in Aquitaine since the Middle Ages.}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nAlthough little is known about the prehistory of the Basques before the period of Roman occupation owing to the difficulty in identifying evidence for specific cultural traits, the mainstream view today is that the Basque area shows signs of archaeological continuity since the [[Aurignacian]] period.\n\nMany Basque archaeological sites, including cave dwellings such as [[Santimami\u00f1e]], provide evidence for continuity from Aurignacian times down to the [[Iron Age]], shortly before Roman occupation. The possibility therefore cannot be ruled out of at least some of the same people having continued to inhabit the area for thirty millennia.\n\nSome scholars have interpreted the Basque words ''aizto'' 'knife' and ''aizkora'' 'axe' as containing ''aitz'' 'stone', which they take as evidence that the Basque language dates back to the [[Paleolithic|Stone Age]].{{Sfnp|Kurlansky|2011|p=32}} However, stone was abandoned in the [[Chalcolithic]], and ''aizkora'' (variants ''axkora'', ''azkora'') is sometimes considered to be [[loanword|loaned]] from Latin ''asciola''; cf. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''azuela'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''aixol''.{{Sfnp|Oroz|1999|p=502}}\n\n====Genetic evidence====\n{{see also|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups}}\nA high concentration of [[Rh-]] among Basques, who have the highest level worldwide, had already been interpreted as suggestive of the antiquity and lack of admixture of the Basque genetic stock. In the 1990s [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] published his findings according to which one of the main European [[autosomal]] [[principal components|components]], PC 5, was shown to be a typically Basque trait believed to have receded owing to the migration of Eastern peoples during the [[Neolithic]] and [[Metal Ages]].{{Sfnp|Cavalli-Sforza|2000|pp=??}}{{Sfnp|Cavalli-Sforza|2006|pp=??}}<ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/7/1361 ''Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans'', Isabelle Dupanloup et al.]</ref>\n\n[[X chromosome]] [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s<ref>[http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/8/12/1289 ''MS205 Minisatellite Diversity in Basques: Evidence for a Pre-Neolithic Component'', Santos Alonso and John A.L. Armour]</ref> also seem to point to Basques being the most direct descendants of prehistoric Western Europeans, having the highest percent of \"Western European genes\" but found also at high levels among neighbor populations, as they are also direct descendants of the same People. However, [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups|mitochondrial DNA]] have cast doubts over this theory.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00170.x ''Temporal Mitochondrial DNA Variation in the Basque Country: Influence of Post-Neolithic Events'', A. alzualde et al.]</ref><ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1523212&blobtype=pdf ''The Mitochondrial Lineage U8a Reveals a Paleolithic Settlement in the Basque Country'' (Gonzalez, et al; May 2006)]</ref> Along the same lines, a genetic study carried out in 2001 revealed that the Y-chromosome of Celtic populations do not differ statistically from the Basques, establishing a link between them and such populations as the Irish and the Welsh.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1256894.stm|title=Genes link Celts to Basques|date=2001-04-03|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative theories===\nThe following alternative theories about the prehistoric origins of the Basques have all had adherents at some time but are rejected by many scholars and do not represent the consensus view:\n\n*Basques as [[Neolithic]] settlers: According to this theory, a precursor of the Basque language might have arrived about 6,000 years ago with the advance of [[agriculture]]. The only archaeological evidence that could partly support this hypothesis would be that for the [[Ebro]] valley area.\n*Basques arrived together with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]: Linked to an unproven linguistic hypothesis that includes Basque and some [[Caucasian languages]] in a single super-family. Even if such a Basque-Caucasian connection did exist, it would have to be at too great a time depth to be relevant to Indo-European migrations. Apart from a [[Celts|Celtic]] presence in the Ebro valley during the [[Urnfield culture]], archaeology offers little support for this hypothesis. The [[Basque language]] shows few certain Celtic or other Indo-European loans, other than those transmitted via Latin or Romance in historic times.\n*Basques as an Iberian subgroup: Based on occasional use by early Basques of the Iberian alphabet and [[Julius Caesar]]'s description of the [[Aquitaine|Aquitanians]] as ''[[Iberians]]''. Apparent similarities between the undeciphered [[Iberian language]] and Basque have also been cited, but this fails to account for the fact that attempts so far to decipher Iberian using Basque as a reference have failed.\n\n===New genetic findings, 2015===\nIn 2015, a new scientific study of Basque DNA was published which seems to indicate that Basques are descendants of Neolithic farmers who mixed with local hunters before becoming genetically isolated from the rest of Europe for millennia.<ref name=\"thescientist\">[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43950/title/Ancient-DNA-Elucidates-Basque-Origins/ Ancient DNA Elucidates Basque Origins]. Researchers find that the people of northern Spain and southern France are an amalgam of early Iberian farmers and local hunters. By Bob Grant | September 9, 2015, thescientist.com.</ref> Mattias Jakobsson from Uppsala University in Sweden analysed genetic material from eight Stone Age human skeletons found in El Portal\u00f3n Cavern in [[Atapuerca Mountains|Atapuerca]], northern Spain. These individuals lived between 3,500 and 5,500 years ago, after the transition to farming in southwest Europe. The results show that these early Iberian farmers are the closest ancestors to present-day Basques.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34175224 Ancient DNA cracks puzzle of Basque origins], BBC, 7 September 2015.</ref>\n\nThe official findings were published in [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]].<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/09/02/1509851112 Ancient genomes link early farmers from Atapuerca in Spain to modern-day Basques], September 9, 2015, pnas.org.</ref>  \"Our results show that the Basques trace their ancestry to early farming groups from Iberia, which contradicts previous views of them being a remnant population that trace their ancestry to [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] groups,\" says Prof. Jakobsson.<ref>[http://phys.org/news/2015-09-ancient-genomes-link-early-farmers.html Ancient genomes link early farmers to Basques], phys.org, September 7, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Basque Country in prehistoric times==\n{{Main|Basque Prehistory}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n[[Image:Franco-Cantabrian region.gif|thumb|250px|Map of the Franco-Cantabrian region, showing the main caves with mural art]]\n[[File:Ekainberriko zaldiak.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse paintings on the walls of the cave Ekain (Ekainberri), near Azpeitia]]\n\nAbout 35,000 years ago, the lands that are now the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], together with neighbouring areas such as [[Aquitaine]] and the [[Pyrenees]], were settled by [[Cro-Magnon]], who gradually displaced the region's earlier [[Neanderthal]] population. The settlers brought the [[Aurignacian]] culture with them.\n\nAt this stage, the Basque Country formed part of the archaeological [[Franco-Cantabric region|Franco-Cantabrian province]] which extended all the way from [[Asturias]] to [[Provence]]. Throughout this region, which underwent similar cultural developments with some local variation, Aurignacian culture was successively replaced by [[Gravettian]], [[Solutrean]], and [[Magdalenian]] cultures. Except for the Aurignacian, these all seem to have originated in the Franco-Cantabrian region, which suggests no further waves of immigration into the area during the Paleolithic period.\n\nWithin the present-day Basque Country, settlement was limited almost exclusively to the Atlantic area, probably for climatic reasons. Important Basque sites include the following:\n\n*[[Santimami\u00f1e]] (Biscay): Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian remains, mural art\n*Bolinkoba (Biscay): Gravettian and Solutrean\n*Ermitia (Gipuzkoa): Solutrean and Magdalenian\n*Amalda (Gipuzkoa): Gravettian and Solutrean\n*Koskobilo (Gipuzkoa): Aurignacian and Solutrean\n*Aitzbitarte (Gipuzkoa): Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian\n*Isturitz (Lower Navarre): Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian, mural art\n*Gatzarria (Soule): Aurignacian and Gravettian\n\n===Epipaleolithic and Neolithic===\nAt the end of the [[Ice Age]], Magdalenian culture gave way to [[Azilian]] culture. Hunters turned from large animals to smaller prey, and fishing and seafood gathering became important economic activities. The southern part of the Basque Country was first settled in this period.\n\nGradually, Neolithic technology started to filter through from the Mediterranean coasts, first in the form of isolated pottery items (Zatoia, Marizulo) and later with the introduction of [[shepherd|sheepherding]]. As in most of Atlantic Europe, this transition progressed slowly.\n\nIn the Ebro valley, more fully Neolithic sites are found. [[Anthropometry|Anthropometric]] classification of the remains suggests the possibility of some Mediterranean colonisation here. A comparable situation is found in Aquitaine, where settlers may have arrived via the [[Garonne]].\n\nIn the second half of the 4th millennium BC, [[Megalith|Megalithic culture]] appeared throughout the area. Burials become collective (possibly implying families or clans) and the [[dolmen]] predominates, while caves are also employed in some places. Unlike the dolmens of the Mediterranean basin which show a preference for corridors, in the Atlantic area they are invariably simple chambers.\n\n===Copper and Bronze Ages===\n[[Image:Harrespil Okabe.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Stone circles|Cromlech]]'' of Okabe ([[Lower Navarre]])]]\n[[File:La Hoyako oin biribileko etxe baten maketa. La Hoyako bizilekuaren irudia, Biasterin (Araba).PNG|thumb|Typical round shack and settlement of La Hoya on the Ebro banks (\u00c1lava)]]\n\nUse of copper and gold, and then other metals, did not begin in the Basque Country until c. 2500. With the arrival of metal working, the first urban settlements made their appearance. One of the most notable towns on account of its size and continuity was [[La Hoya, Alava|La Hoya]] in southern \u00c1lava, which may have served as a link, and possibly a trading centre, between [[Portugal]] ([[Vila Nova de S\u00e3o Pedro]] culture) and [[Languedoc]] (Treilles group). Concurrently, caves and natural shelters remained in use, particularly in the Atlantic region.\n\nUndecorated pottery continued from the Neolithic period up until the arrival of the [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]] with its characteristic pottery style, which is mainly found around the Ebro Valley. Building of megalithic structures continued until the Late Bronze Age.\n\nIn Aquitaine, there was a notable presence of the [[Artenacian culture]], a culture of bowmen that spread rapidly through Western France and Belgium from its homeland near the Garonne c. 2400.\n\nIn the Late Bronze Age, parts of the southern Basque Country came under the influence of the pastoralist [[Cogotas]] I culture of the Iberian plateau.\n\n===Iron Age===\nIn the [[European Iron Age|Iron Age]], bearers of the late [[Urnfield culture]] followed the Ebro upstream as far as the southern fringes of the Basque Country, leading to the incorporation of the [[Hallstatt culture]]; this corresponds to the beginning of Indo-European, notably [[Celts|Celtic]] influence in the region.\n\nIn the Basque Country, settlements now appear mainly at points of difficult access, probably for defensive reasons, and had elaborate defense systems. During this phase, agriculture seemingly became more important than [[animal husbandry]].\n\nIt may be during this period that new megalithic structures, the (stone circle) or ''[[Stone circles|cromlech]]'' and the megalith or ''[[menhir]]'', made their appearance.\n\n==Roman rule==\n[[File:Torre de Urkulu.jpg|thumb|250px|Tower of [[Urkulu]], a commemorative Roman tower]]\n[[File:Iru\u00f1a Veleia 1.JPG|thumb|250px|Reconstruction at the site of [[Iru\u00f1a-Veleia]], in central \u00c1lava]]\nOn arrival of the Romans to current south-west France, the Pyrenees and its threshold up to Cantabria, the territory was occupied by a number of tribes, most of them non Indo-European (the nature of others remain unclear, e.g. the Caristii). The [[Vascones]] show the closest identification with current Basques, but evidence points to Basque-like people extending around the [[Pyrenees]] and up to the Garonne, as evidenced by Caesar's testimony on his book ''De Bello Gallico'', [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] inscriptions (person and god names), and several place-names.\n\nMost of the Aquitanian tribes were subjugated by Crasus, lieutenant of Caesar, in 65 BC. However, prior to this conquest (celebrated apparently, on the [[Urkulu|Tower of Urkulu]]), the Romans had reached the upper Ebro region at the beginning of the 2nd century BC, on the fringes of the Basque territory (Calagurris, Graccurris). Under [[Pompey]] in the 1st century BC, the Romans stationed in and founded Pompaelo (modern [[Pamplona]], ''Iru\u00f1ea'' in Basque) but Roman rule was not consolidated until the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]]. Its laxness suited the Basques well, allowing them to retain their traditional laws and leadership. Romanisation was limited on the lands of the current Basque Country closer to the Atlantic, while it was more intense on the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]]. The survival of the separate Basque language has often been attributed to the fact that Basque Country was little developed by the Romans.\n\nThere was a significant Roman presence in the garrison of Pompaelo, a city south of the Pyrenees founded by and named after Pompey. Conquest of the area further west followed a fierce Roman campaign against the [[Cantabri]] (see [[Cantabrian Wars]]). There are archaeological remains from this period of [[garrison]]s protecting commercial routes all along the Ebro river, and along a [[Roman road]] between [[Astorga (Spain)|Asturica]] and [[Burdigala]].\n\nA unit of [[Varduli]] was stationed on [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the north of Britain for many years, and earned the title ''fida'' (faithful) for service to the Emperor. Romans apparently entered into alliances (''foedera'', singular ''foedus'') with many local tribes, allowing them almost total autonomy within the Empire.<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/8809?op=4&primR=1&regs=10&idi=eu&EIKVOGEN=Imperio%20Romano&pos=2 Alianzas (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref>\n\n[[Livy]] mentions the natural division between the ''Ager'' and the ''Saltus Vasconum'', i.e. between the fields of the [[Ebro]] basin and the mountains to the north.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} It has been held by historians that Romanisation was significant in the fertile ''Ager'' but almost null in the ''Saltus'', where Roman towns were scarce and generally small.<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/120795?op=4&primR=1&regs=10&idi=eu&EIKVOGEN=Ager%20Vasconum&pos=7 Saltus Vasconum (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref> However, the latest 21st century findings have called into question that assumption, highlighting the importance of fishing (fish processing factories, ''caetariae'') and mining sector on the Atlantic arch (the Atlantic route of cabotage), as well as other settlements dotting the Atlantic basin.\n\nThe [[Bagaudae]]<ref name=\"Bagaudas\">[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/10102?op=4&primR=1&regs=10&idi=eu&EIKVOGEN=Bagaudas&pos=4 Bagaudas (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref> seem to have produced a major impact on Basque history in the late Empire. In the late 4th century and throughout the 5th century, the Basque region from the [[Garonne]] to the [[Ebro]] escaped Roman control in the midst of revolts. Several Roman villas (Li\u00e9dena, Ramalete) were burned to the ground. The proliferation of mints is interpreted as evidence for an ''inner [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' around [[Vasconia]], where coins were minted for the purpose of paying troops.{{Sfnp|Sorauren|1998|pp=??}} After the fall of the Empire, the struggle against Rome's [[Visigoth]] allies continued.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Christianization===\n[[File:Ascain - pont romain.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman bridge in [[Ascain|Ascain (Azkaine)]]]]\n[[File:Euskal Hilarri Diskoidalak, San Telmo museoa, Donostia.jpg|thumb|250px|Medieval stellae collection exhibited at the San Telmo Museum, [[Donostia]]]]\nDespite early Christian testimonies and institutional organization, Basque Christianization was slow. The Basques hung onto their own pagan religion and beliefs (later transfigured into mythology), and were Christianized at a par with the [[Germanic peoples]] hostile to [[Carolingian]] expansion (8-9th century), such as the Saxons. However, it remained a slow internal process that some scholars have extended up to the 15th century.\n\nThe Christian poet [[Prudentius]] sings to the prominent Vasconic town of [[Calahorra]] in his work ''Peristephanon'' (I) written in the early 5th century, reminding to the town's \"one-time pagan [[Vascones]]\" of the martyrdom gone through in it formerly (305). Calahorra itself became episcopal see in the 4th century, with its bishop holding an authority over a territory that extended well into the lands of present-day central [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]] (''Sierra de Cameros''), [[Bizkaia|Biscay]], [[\u00c1lava]], a large part of [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]]. In the 5th century, [[Eauze]] (Elusa) is attested as episcopal see in the [[Novempopulania]], but the actual influence of these centres on the different domains of the society is not well known.\n\nThe collapse of the Roman Empire seems to have turned the tide. Basques are not identified anymore with Roman civilisation and its declining urban life after the late 5th century, and they prevailed over Roman urban culture, so that paganism remained widespread among the Basques at least up to the late 7th century and the failed mission of [[Saint Amandus]].{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=104}} However, less than a century later, no reference is made by Frankish chroniclers to Basque paganism in the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Frankish assault on Basques and Aquitanians]], despite its powerful propaganda value, [[Odo of Aquitaine|Odo]] was even recognised as champion of Christianity by the Pope.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Charlemagne]] started a policy of colonisation in Aquitaine and Vasconia after the submission of both territories in 768\u2013769. Enlisting the Church on his side to strengthen his power in Vasconia, he restored Frankish authority on the high Pyrenees in 778, divided the land between bishops and abbots and began to baptize the pagan Basques of this region.{{Sfnp|Lewis|1965|p=39}}\n\nMuslim accounts from the period of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] and beginning of 9th century identify the Basques as ''magi'' or 'pagan wizards', they were not considered 'people of the Book' (Christians).{{Sfnp|Jimeno Jurio|1995|p=47}} Still in 816, Muslim chroniclers attest not far from Pamplona a so-called 'Saltan', \"knight of the pagans\", certainly a distorted name maybe referring to Zaldun, literally in Basque \"Knight\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Later Muslim historians cite Navarrese leaders of the early 9th century (but not only them) as holding onto polytheist religious practices and criticize the [[Banu Qasi]] for allying with them.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Further|Duchy of Vasconia}}\nIn 409, [[Vandals]], [[Alans]], and [[Suevi]] forced their way into Hispania through the western Pyrenees, chased closely by the Visigoths in 416 as allies of Rome, while the consequences of their advances are not clear.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=70\u201371}} In 418 Rome gave the provinces of [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]] and [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Tarraconensis]] to the [[Visigoths]], as ''[[foederati]]'', probably with a view to defending [[Novempopulana]] from the raids of the [[Bagaudae]]. It has sometimes been argued that the Basque were underlying these roving armed hosts, but this claim is far from certain. The contemporary chronicler Hydatius was well aware of the existence of ''the Vasconias'', but does not identify the Bagaudae rebels as Basque.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=72}}\n\nWhile the Visigoths seem to have claimed the Basque territory from an early date, the chronicles point to their failure to subdue it, punctuated only by sporadic military successes. The years between 435 and 450 saw a succession of confrontations between the Bagaudae and Romano-Gothic troops, the best documented of which were the battles of [[Toulouse]], [[Uharte-Arakil|Araceli]], and [[Tarazona|Turiasum]].<ref name=\"Bagaudas\"/> Just about the same period, in 449\u201351, the Suevi under their king [[Rechiar]] ravaged the territories of the Vascones, probably looting their way through the region on their way back home from Toulouse. Settlements were clearly damaged after the raids and, while [[Calahorra]] and Pamplona survived, Iru\u00f1a (Veleia) seems to have been abandoned as a result.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=76}}\n\nAfter 456, the Visigoths crossed the Pyrenees twice from Aquitaine, probably at [[Roncesvalles]], in an effort to destroy the Suevic kingdom of Rechiar, but as the chronicle of [[Hydatius]], the only Spanish source of the period, ends in 469, the actual events of the Visigothic confrontation with the Basques are obscure.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=81\u201382}} Apart from the vanished previous tribal boundaries, the great development between the death of Hydatius and the events accounted for in the 580s is the appearance of the Basques as a \"mountain roaming people\", most of the times depicted as posing a threat to urban life.\n\nThe [[Franks]] displaced the Visigoths from Aquitaine in 507, placing the Basques between the two warring kingdoms. In 581 or thereabouts both Franks and Visigoths attacked ''Vasconia'' (''Wasconia'' in [[Gregory of Tours]]), but neither with success. In 587 the Franks launched a second attack on the Basques, but they were defeated on the plains of Aquitaine, implying that Basque settlement or conquest had begun north of the Pyrenees.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=85\u201387}} However, the theory of a Basque expansionism in the Early Middle Ages has often been dismissed and is not necessary to understand the historic evolution of this region.{{Sfnp|Larrea/Bonnassie|1998|pp=123-129}} Soon afterwards, the Franks and Goths created their respective [[marches]] in order to contain the Basques  \u0336  the [[Duchy of Cantabria]] in the south and the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] in the north (602).{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=91}}\n\nIn the south-western marches of the Frankish Duchy of Vasconia, extending at certain periods during the 6-8th centuries across the Pyrenees,{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=93\u201395}} Cantabria (maybe including Biscay and \u00c1lava) and Pamplona remained out of Visigothic rule, with the latter sticking to either self-rule or under Frankish suzerainty (Councils of Toledo unattended between 589 and 684).\n\nAfter much fighting, the Duchy of Vasconia was consolidated as an independent polity between 660 and 678 ruled by the [[Duke of Aquitaine|duke]] Felix, who by means of a personal union with the [[Aquitaine#Early Middle Ages|Duchy of Aquitaine]] established a ''de facto'' realm detached from the distant Merovingian rule. Synergies between \u2018Roman\u2019, non-Frankish urban elites and a rural militarised Vascon power base enabled a strong political entity in south-west Gaul. The Basque-Aquitanian realm reached its zenith at the time of [[Odo the Great]], but the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim invasion]] of 711, at which time the Visigoth [[Roderic]] was fighting the Basques in Pamplona, and the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] posed new threats for this state, eventually spurring its downfall and breakup.\n[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|thumb|250px|The Duchy of Vasconia and neighbouring territories (740)]]\nVasconia's submission to the Franks after Odo's death in 735 was interrupted by frequent outbreaks of resistance, led by the latter's son [[Hunald I of Aquitaine|Hunald]] (735-744) and grandson [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]] (+768). In 762, the hosts of Frankish king Pippin crossed the Loire, attacked [[Bourges]] and [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] defended by the Basques and ransacked Aquitaine. After several military setbacks, the Basques pledged submission to Pippin on the river Garonne ([[Fronsac, Gironde|Fronsac]], c. 769). At this time (7-8th centuries), Vasconia is sometimes mentioned as stretching from the lands of Cantabria in the south-west all the way to the river Loire in the north pointing to a not preponderant but clearly significant Basque presence in Aquitaine (i.e. between Garonne and Loire).\n\n[[File:North and south of the Pyrenees (Year 760).jpg|250px|thumb|Duchy of Vasconia and both sides of the Pyrenees (760)]]\n\nVasconia's newly suppressed resistance cleared the way for the Frankish army to deal with [[Charlemagne]]\u2019s interests in the Spanish marches (siege of Zaragoza). After pulling down the walls of Pamplona, Roland's rear guard headed north and were defeated in the first [[Battle of Roncevaux]] (778) by the ''treacherous'' Basques, as put by Frankish chroniclers, suggesting that the Basques overall and duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus]] backed down on their 769 allegiance vow. After 781, tired of the Basque uprisings, Charlemagne appointed no more dukes, instead opting for a direct rule by creating the Kingdom of Aquitaine.\n\nThe Basque-Muslim state of the [[Banu Qasi]] (meaning \"heirs of Cassius\" in Arabic), founded c. 800 near [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] (''Tutera'' in Basque), acted as a buffer state between the Basques and the Cordovan Umayyads that helped consolidate the independent Kingdom of Pamplona after the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|second Battle of Roncevaux]], when a Frankish expedition led by the counts Eblus and Aznar (sometimes identified as [[Aznar Galindez I|the local Frankish vassal toppled in Aragon]] some 10 years earlier) was defeated by the Pamplonese and maybe the Banu Qasi,<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/38128?op=4&primR=21&regs=10&idi=en&EIKVOGEN=Ducado%20Vasconia&pos=25 Ducado de Vasconia (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref> after crossing the Pyrenees, probably in the wake of Basque rebellions north of the Pyrenees.

The line of the Aristas ruled Pamplona side by side with the Banu Qasi of Tudela up to the decline of both dynasties (early 10th century). When [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho I Garces]] rose to prominence in 905, Pamplonese allegiances switched to their neighbour Christian realms, with the new royal lineage starting its expansion south to the territory of their former allies.\n\nIn 844, the Vikings sailed up the Garonne to Bordeaux and Toulouse and raided the countryside on either bank of the river, killing the Duke of the Basques [[Seguin II of Gascony|Sigwinum II]] (recorded as Sihiminum too, maybe Semeno) in Bordeaux. They took over Bayonne, and attacked Pamplona (859), even taking the king Garcia prisoner, only released in exchange for a hefty ransom. They were to be overcome only in 982 by the Basque duke [[William II Sanchez of Gascony]], who made his way back from Pamplona to fight to the north of Bayonne and put a term to Viking incursions, so allowing monasteries to spring up all over Gascony thereafter,{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=132}} the first of which was the one of [[Saint-Sever]], ''Caput Vasconiae''.\n\nWilliam started a policy of rapprochement to Pamplona, by establishing dynastic ties with their rulers. Despite its newly found strength, by the 10th century the territory of Vasconia (to become [[Gascony]] and stripped by the 11th\u201312th centuries of its original ethnic sense) fragmented into different feudal regions, for example, the viscountcies of [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]] out of former tribal systems and minor realms ([[County of Vasconia]]), while south of the Pyrenees the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] and the Pyrenean counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]] (later merged into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]) and [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] arose as the main regional powers with Basque population in the 9th century.\n\n===High Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Navarre}}\n[[Image:Kingdom of Pamplona (c. 925).gif|thumb|250px|The Kingdom of Pamplone in the early 10th century]]\n[[File:Londresko laudoa - Laudo de Londres (1176-1177).jpg|thumb|250px|The Navarrese territories circa 1179]]\n\nUnder [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho III the Great]], Pamplona controlled the entire southern Basque Country. Actually, its power extended from [[Burgos]] and [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] to northern [[Aragon]]. Through marriage Sancho also became the acting [[List of Castilian Monarchs|Earl of Castile]] and held a protectorate over [[Gascony]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]]. However, in 1058, the former [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] turned into Gascony, merged by personal union with Aquitaine ([[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII]]). William VIII intervened on the dynastic struggles taking place in Arag\u00f3n and other Peninsular kingdoms, but Gascony progressively moved away from the Basque political sphere, just as its own ethnic make-up: the Basque people increasingly turned into [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] on the plains to the north of the central and west Pyrenees.\n\nFollowing Sancho III's death, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and Aragon became separate kingdoms ruled by his sons, who were responsible for the first partitioning of Pamplona (1076). Pamplona, the main Basque kingdom (to be renamed Navarre), was absorbed and dwindled for the benefit of Arag\u00f3n. The kingdom of Arag\u00f3n itself expanded from its Pyrenean stronghold to the Ebro valley (Saragossa and Tudela conquered in 1118), so shifting its power base to the lowlands and urban areas, with the Basque language and culture receding at the pressure of the stronger urban population and Latin (and Arabic) civilization's prestige encountered at the Ebro valley. Basque ceased to be the main language of communication in many areas of the central Pyrenees, and [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Navarro-Aragonese]], took over instead. The colonizers of the lands conquered to the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian kingdoms]] brought the new language along, and not Basque.\n\nThe [[kingdom of Navarre]] was restored in 1157 under [[Garc\u00eda VI of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]] ''the Restorer'', who fought Castile for control over its western lands of the realm (La Rioja, [[\u00c1lava]], and parts of Old Castile; see map). In the mid-12th century, Navarrese kings [[Sancho the Wise]] and his successor [[Sancho VII of Navarre|Sancho VII]] asserted Navarrese authority over central \u00c1lava in their contest with Castile by granting various [[Municipal charter|town charters]], i.e. [[County of Trevi\u00f1o|Trevi\u00f1o]] (1161), [[Laguardia, \u00c1lava|Laguardia]] (1164), [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (1181), [[Bernedo]], Anto\u00f1ana (1182), La Puebla de Arganz\u00f3n (1191).{{Sfnp|Portilla|1991|p=12}} A peace treaty signed in 1179 ceded La Rioja and the northeastern part of present-day [[Old Castile]] to the Castilian crown. In return, this pact acknowledged that central \u00c1lava, [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]] belonged to Navarre.\n\nIn 1199, while Navarre's King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI ''the Wise'']] was away on a diplomatic mission in [[Tlemcen]], Castile invaded and annexed the western Basque Country, leaving Navarre landlocked. King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] promised to give the [[Durangaldea]], Gipuzkoa and \u00c1lava back, but ultimately that did not happen. However, the Castilian king went on to ratify their [[fueros of Navarre|Navarrese rights]] and garner their loyalty. They managed to retain a large degree of their self-government and [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|native laws]], which all Castilian (and later, Spanish) monarchs, or their viceroys, would swear to uphold on oath until the 19th century. During the following decades, Castilian kings reinforced their position over Navarre's borders and secured new commercial routes, notably the [[San Adrian (tunnel)|Tunnel Route]], by chartering new towns, e.g. Trevi\u00f1o (1254, rechartered), [[Agurain]], [[Campezo/Kanpezu]], Corres, [[Contrasta]], [[Segura]], [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]], [[Ordu\u00f1a]] (rechartered), [[Mondragon, Spain|Mondragon]] (Arrasate; 1260, rechartered), [[Bergara]] (1268, rechartered), [[Ordizia|Villafranca]] (1268), [[Artziniega]] (1272), etc.{{Sfnp|Portilla|1991|p=13}}\n\n===Basque sailors===\n{{See also|History of Basque whaling}}\n[[Image:Basques Newfoundland.gif|250px|thumb|Basque fishing sites in Canada in the 16th and 17th centuries]]\n[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 133-134.jpg|250px|thumb|Basque warriors in military outfit (1530s)]]\n\nBasques played an important role in early European ventures into the Atlantic Ocean. The earliest document to mention the use of whale oil or blubber by the Basques dates from 670. In 1059, whalers from [[Lapurdi]] are recorded to have presented the oil of the first whale they captured to the viscount. Apparently the Basques were averse to the taste of [[whale meat]] themselves, but did successful business selling it and the blubber to the [[French people|French]], Castilians and [[Flanders|Flemings]].\n\nOn the heat of the 1199\u20131201 Castilian conquests (Gipuzkoa, shire of Durango, \u00c1lava), a number of towns were founded all along the coast during the next two hundred years. The towns chartered by the Castilian kings, thrived on fishing and maritime trade (with northern Europe), as depicted in their coat of arms. The development of ironworks (water propelled) and shipyards added to the Basque naval effort. Basque whalers used longboats or ''traineras'' which they rowed in the vicinity of the coast or from a larger ship.\n\nWhaling and [[cod]]-fishing are probably responsible for early Basque contact with both the North Sea and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The Basques began cod-fishing and later whaling in Labrador and Newfoundland as early as the first half of the 16th century.\n\nIn Europe, the rudder seems to have been a Basque invention, to judge from three masted ships depicted in a 12th-century fresco in [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] (Navarre; ''Lizarra'' in Basque), and also seals preserved in Navarrese and Parisian historical archives which show similar vessels. The first mention of use of a rudder was referred to as steering \"\u00e0 la Navarraise\" or \"\u00e0 la Bayonnaise\".{{Sfnp|Urzainqui/Olaizola|1998|p=?}}\n\nMagellan's expedition was manned on departure by 200 sailors, at least 35 of them Basques, and when Magellan was killed in the Philippines, his Basque second-in-command, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] took the ship all the way back to Spain. 18 crew members completed the circumnavigation, 4 of them Basques. The Basques mutinied in [[Christopher Columbus]]' expedition, a distinctive group who is reported to have erected a makeshift camp in an American island.\n\nEarly 17th century international treaties seriously undermined Basque whaling across the northern Atlantic. In 1615, Gipuzkoan whalers frequenting Iceland for decades [[Sp\u00e1nverjav\u00edgin|were massacred]] (32) by an Icelandic force commanded by the sheriff Ari Magnusson acting on orders of the Danish king. The act ordering the killing of Basques was finally revoked in 2015 during a Basque-Icelandic friendship event.<ref>{{cite news |last=Perez Zala |first=Ander |date=2015-07-17|title=Una jornada evoca la masacre de balleneros vascos en Islandia |url=http://www.naiz.eus/en/actualidad/noticia/20150717/400-aniversario-del-baskavigin-la-masacre-de-los-balleneros-vascos |newspaper=Naiz|location=Donostia|access-date=2015-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/04/27/killing-basques-now-banned-west-fjords |title=Killing of Basques now banned on West Fjords|last1=Svala Arnarsd\u00f3ttir|first1=Eygl\u00f3|last2= |first2= |date=2015-04-27|website=Iceland Review|publisher=|access-date=2015-07-22|quote=}}</ref> However, northern Atlantic fishing continued at least up to the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), when the Spanish Basques were definitely deprived of their traditional northern European fishing grounds.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nThe Basque Country in the [[Late Middle Ages]] was ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In Navarre these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the [[Agramont]] and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, the two major warring factions were named O\u00f1az and Gamboa (cf. the [[Guelphs]] and [[Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures called ''dorretxeak'' (\"tower houses\") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fire, sometimes by royal decree.\n\n==Modern period==\n{{Further|Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros{{!}}Basque and Pyrenean fueros}}\n\n===Self-government status and accommodation===\n\n====Navarre divided and home rule====\n\n[[File:Henri d'Albret (1503\u20131555), King of Navarre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry II of Navarre|King Henry II]] called the Parliament of Navarre in [[Saint-Palais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], with a requirement for all its members to have a command in Basque (1523)]]\n\nBasques in the present-day Spanish and French districts of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] managed to retain a large degree of self-government within their respective districts, practically functioning initially as separate nation-states. The western Basques managed to confirm their home rule at the end of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]'s civil wars, pledging an oath to claimant [[Isabella I of Castile]] in exchange for generous terms in overseas trade. Their ''fueros'' recognised separate laws, taxation and courts in each district.\nAs the [[Middle Ages]] drew to a close, the Basques got sandwiched between two rising superpowers after the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre]], i.e. France and Spain. Most of the Basque population ended up in Spain, or \"the Spains\", according to its poly-centric arrangement prevailing under the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburgs]]. The initial repression in Navarre on the local nobility and population (1513, 1516, 1523) was followed by a softer, compromising policy on the part of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. While heavily conditioned by its geopolitical situation, the [[Kingdom of Navarre#Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees|Kingdom of Navarre-Bearn]] remained independent and attempts at reunification, both in Iberian and continental Navarre, did not cease up to 1610&mdash;[[Henry III of Navarre|King Henry of Navarre and France]] was set to march over Navarre at the moment of his assassination.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] made some inroads and was supported by Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]] of [[Lower Navarre|Navarre]]-[[Viscounty of Bearn|Bearn]]. The printing of books in Basque, mostly on Christian themes, was introduced in the late 16th century by the Basque-speaking [[bourgeois]]ie around [[Bayonne, France|Bayonne]] in the northern Basque Country. King [[Henry III of Navarre]], a Protestant, converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become King [[Henry IV of France]] too (\"Paris is well worth a mass\"). However, [[Protestant Reformation|Reformist]] ideas, imported via the vibrant [[Way of Saint James|Ways of Saint James]] and sustained by the Kingdom of Navarre-Bearn, were subject to intense persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and other institutions as early as 1521, especially in bordering areas, a matter with close links to the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|shaky status of Navarre]].\n[[File:Figure Blason Pecheurs Basques.svg|thumb|left|On the whale hunt, as depicted on the coat of arms of [[Biarritz]]]]\n\nThe Parliament of Navarre in Pamplona (''The Three States, Cortes'') kept denouncing King [[Philip II of Spain]]'s breach of the binding terms laid out in his oath taking ceremony&mdash;tension came to a head in 1592 with an imposed oath pledging for [[Philip III of Spain]] fraught with irregularities&mdash;while in 1600 allegations arise of discrimination by Castilian abbots and bishops to the Navarrese monks \"for the sake of their nation\", as pointed by the Kingdom's Government (the ''Diputaci\u00f3n'').{{Sfnp|Urzainqui/Esarte/Et al.|2013|p=30}} A combination of factors&mdash;suspicion of the Basques, intolerance to a different language, religious practices, traditions, high status held by women in the area (cf. whaling campaigns), along with political intrigues involving the lords of Urtubie in [[Urrugne|Urru\u00f1a]] and the critical [[Urdazubi/Urdax|Urdazubi]] abbey&mdash;led to the [[Basque witch trials]] in 1609.\n[[File:Fourneau 2.JPG|thumb|A furnace to melt whale grease left by the Basques in [[\u00cele aux Basques]] off Canada's coast]]\nIn 1620 the ''de jure'' separate [[Lower Navarre]] was absorbed by the Kingdom of France, and in 1659 the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] upheld actual Spanish and French territorial control and determined the fate of vague bordering areas, so establishing customs that did not exist up to that point and restricting free cross-border access. The measures decided were implemented as of 1680.\n\nThe region specific laws also underwent a gradual erosion and devaluation, more so in the [[French Basque Country]] than in the [[Southern Basque Country|southern districts]]. In 1660 the authority of the Assembly of [[Labourd]] (''Biltzar'' of Ustaritz) was significantly curtailed. In 1661 French centralization and the nobility's ambition to take over and privatize commons unleashed a popular rebellion in [[Soule]]&mdash;led by Bernard Goihenetche \"Matalaz\"&mdash;ultimately quelled in blood.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=267}} However, Labourd and its ''Biltzar'' retained important attributions and autonomy, showing [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carte_des_Traites_1732.png an independent fiscal system].\n\n====Masters of the ocean====\n[[File:Mirandaola_burdinola_0002.png|thumb|Blacksmiths dressed up in period attire at an ironwork re-enactment in [[Legazpi, Spain|Legazpi]]]]\n[[File:Vernet-port-Bayonne.jpg|thumb|Harbour of Bayonne in 1755, at the height of trade within the [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]]]]\n\nThe Basques (or ''Biscaynes''), especially proper Biscayans [[Gipuzkoa]]ns and [[Lapurdi]]ans, thrived on whale hunting, shipbuilding, iron exportation to England, and trade with northern Europe and America during the 16th century, at which time the Basques became the masters not only of whaling but the Atlantic Ocean. However, King [[Philip II of Spain]]'s failed ''[[Armada Invencible]]'' endeavour in 1588,  largely relying on heavy whaling and trade galleons confiscated to the reluctant Basques, proved disastrous. The Spanish defeat triggered the immediate collapse of Basque supremacy over the oceans and the rise of English hegemony.{{Sfnp|Collins|1987}} As whaling declined privateering soared.\n\nMany Basques found in the Castilian-Spanish Empire an opportunity to promote their social position and venture to America to make a living and sometimes amass a little fortune that spurred the foundation of the present-day [[baserri]]s. Basques serving under the Spanish flag became renowned sailors, and many of them were among the first Europeans to reach America. For example, [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first expedition to the ''New World'' was partially manned by Basques, the Santa Maria vessel was made in Basque shipyards, and the owner, [[Juan de la Cosa]], may have been a Basque.{{Sfnp|Campbell|1987}}\n\nOther seamen became renowned as [[privateer]]s for the French and Spanish kings alike, namely Joanes Suhigaraitxipi from Bayonne (17th century) and [[\u00c9tienne Pellot]] ([[Hendaye]]), \"the last privateer\" (early 19th century). By the end of the 16th century, Basques were conspicuously present in America, notably Chile, or [[Potos\u00ed]]. In the latter, we hear that they went on to cluster around a national confederacy [[War of the Vicu\u00f1as and Basques|engaging in war against another one]], the ''Vicu\u00f1as'', formed by a melting pot of Spanish colonists and Native Americans (1620-1625).{{Sfnp|Campbell|1987}}\n\n====A Basque trade area====\n[[File:1712 Basque districts.png|thumb|French map of the Basque districts (mid-18th century)]]\nThe Basques initially welcomed Philip V&mdash;from the lineage of King [[Henry III of Navarre]]&mdash;to the Crown of Castile (1700), but the absolutist outlook inherited from [[Louis XIV|his grandfather]] could hardly withstand the test of the Basque contractual system. The 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (see [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque sailors]] above) and the [[Nueva Planta decrees|1714 suppression of home rule]] in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]] disquieted the Basques. It did not take long until the Spanish king, relying on prime minister [[Giulio Alberoni]], attempted to enlarge his tax revenue and foster a Spanish internal market by meddling in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque low-tax trade area]] and moving Basque customs from the [[Ebro river|Ebro]] to the coast and the Pyrenees. With their overseas and customary cross-Pyrenean trade&mdash;and by extension home rule&mdash;under threat, the royal advance was responded by the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|western Basques]] with a trail of ''matxinadas'', or uprisings, that shook 30 towns in coastal areas (Biscay, Gipuzkoa).{{Sfnp|Kamen|2001|p=125}} Spanish troops were sent over, and the widespread rebellion quelled in blood.<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/65117/35671 Matxinada de 1718 (Au\u00f1amendi Entziklopedia)]</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the events, an expedition led by the [[Duke of Berwick]] dispatched by the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] broke into Spanish territory by the western Pyrenees (April 1719) only to find Gipuzkoans, Biscayans and \u00c1lavans making a formal, conditional recognition of French rule (August 1719).{{Sfnp|Kamen|2001|p=125}} Confronted with a collapsing Basque loyalty, King Philip V backed down on his designs in favour of bringing customs back to the Ebro (1719). A pardon to the leaders of the rebellion in 1726 paved the way to an understanding of the [[Juntas Generales|Basque regional governments]] with Madrid officials, and the ensuing foundation of the [[Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] in 1728. The Basque districts in Spain kept operating virtually as independent republics.{{Sfnp|Kamen|2001|p=121}}\n\nThe Guipuzcoan Company greatly added to the prosperity of the Basque districts, by exporting iron commodities and importing products such as cacao, tobacco, and hides.{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|p=88}} Merchandise imported on to the Spanish heartland in turn would incur no duties in its customs.{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|p=90}} The vibrant trade that followed added to a flourishing building activity and the establishment of the pivotal [[Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country|Royal Basque Society]], led by [[Xavier Maria de Munibe e Idiaquez|Xavier Maria de Munibe]], for the encouragement of science and arts.\n\nEmigration to America did not stop, with Basques&mdash;reputed for their close solidarity bonds, high organizational skills and an industrious disposition&mdash;found venturing into Upper [[The Californias|California]] at the head of the early expeditions and governor positions, e.g. [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]], [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], [[Diego de Borica]], [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arrillaga|J.J. de Arrillaga]], etc. At home, the need for technical innovations&mdash;not encouraged any longer by the Spanish Crown during the last third of the 18th century&mdash;the virtual exhaustion of the forests supplying the ironworks, and the decline of the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas after the end of its trade monopoly with America heralded a major economic and political crisis.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the Basques were deprived of their customary trade with America and choked by the Spanish disproportionately high customs duties in the Ebro river, but at least enjoyed a fluent internal market and intensive trade with France. [[Kingdom of Navarre#The crown and the kingdom. A constitutional foundation|Navarre]]'s geographic distribution of trade in late 18th century is estimated at 37.2% with France (unspecified), 62.3% with other Basque districts, and only 0.5% with the Spanish heartland.{{Sfnp|Esparza|2012|p=57}} On a positive note the Spanish customs exactions imposed over the Ebro favoured a more European orientation and the circulation of innovative ideas&mdash;labelled by many in Spain as \"un-Spanish\"&mdash;both technical and humanistic, such as Rousseau's '[[social contract]]', hailed especially by the Basque liberals, who widely supported home rule (''fueros''). Cross-Pyrenean contacts among Basque scholars and public personalities also intensified, increasing awareness of a common identity beyond district specific practices.\n\n===Under the nation-states===\n\n====Revolution and war====\n{{Further|End of Basque home rule in France}}\n[[File:Rio Ebro, heart of La Rioja.jpg|thumb|Ebro river winding down La Rioja of [[\u00c1lava]] and on into the Ribera of Navarre, both fertile grounds for vineyards and cereal crops]]\n[[File:Battle of Nivelle - November 10th 1813 - Fonds Ancely - B315556101 A HEATH 029.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Nivelle]], follow-up to Donostia's destruction (1813)]]\n\nSelf-government in the northern Basque Country came to an abrupt end when the [[French Revolution]] centralized government and abolished the [[Fueros#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|region specific powers]] recognized by the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]''. The French political design intently pursued a dissolution of the Basque identity into a new French nation, and in 1793 that French national ideal was enforced with terror over the population.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|pp=55-57}}<ref>The word ''terrorism'' was coined during this period.

It has been argued that despite its 'fraternal' intent, the intervention of the French Revolution actually destroyed a highly participatory political culture, based on the provincial assemblies (the democratic ''Biltzar'', and the other Estates).{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|pp=58}}\n\nThe [[Southern Basque Country]] was mired in constant disputes with the royal Spanish authority&mdash;breach of ''fueros''&mdash;and talks came to a deadlock on accession of [[Manuel Godoy]] to office. The central government started to enforce its decisions single-handedly, e.g. regional quotas in military mobilization, so the different Basque autonomous governments&mdash;Navarre, Gipuzkoa, Biscay, \u00c1lava&mdash;felt definitely disenfranchised. During the [[War of the Pyrenees#Western Pyrenees|War of the Pyrenees]] and the [[Peninsular War]], the impending threat to the self-government on the part of the Spanish royal authority was critical for war events and alliances&mdash;cf. [[Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey]]'s letters, and political developments in Gipuzkoa. The liberal class supporting self-government was quelled by the Spanish authorities following the War of the Pyrenees&mdash;court-martial in Pamplona as of 1796.\n\n[[Manuel Godoy]]'s attempt to establish in Bilbao a parallel harbour under direct royal control was perceived as a blatant interference with what were considered internal affairs of the Basques, and was met with the ''Zamacolada'' uprising in Bilbao, a broad-based riot including several cross-class interests, violently quashed by the intervention of the Spanish military (1804).{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=69}} The offensive on the ground was accompanied by an attempt to discredit the sources of Basque self-government as [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] granted privileges, notably [[Juan Antonio Llorente]]'s ''Noticias hist\u00f3ricas de las tres provincias vascongadas...''

A project drafted with the input of the Basque revolutionary [[Dominique Joseph Garat|D.J.

The opposing Isabeline Army had the vital support of British, French (notably the [[Algeria]]n legion) and Portuguese forces, and the backing of these governments. The Irish legion (''[[Tercio]]'') was virtually annihilated by the Basques in the [[Battle of Oriamendi]].\n\nHowever, the Carlist ideology was not in itself prone to stand up for the Basque specific institutions, traditions, and identity, but royal absolutism and Church,{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=275}} thriving in rural based environments and totally opposed to modern liberal ideas. They presented themselves as true Spaniards, and contributed to the Spanish centralizing drive. Despite the circumstances and their Catholicism, many Basques came to think that staunch conservatism was not leading them anywhere.\n\nAfter Tomas Zumalacarregui's early and unexpected death during the Siege of Bilbao in 1835 and further military successes up to 1837, the [[First Carlist War]] started to turn against the Carlists, which in turn widened the gap between the Apostolic (official) and the Basque pro-fueros parties within the Carlist camp. Echoing a widespread malaise, J.A. Mu\u00f1agorri took the lead of a faction advocating a split with claimant to the throne [[Carlos Mar\u00eda Isidro de Borb\u00f3n|Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]] under the banner \"Peace and Fueros\" (cf. ''[[Mu\u00f1agorriren bertsoak]]''). The dissatisfaction crystallized in the [[Convention of Vergara|1839 Embrace of Bergara]] and the subsequent [[s:es:Decreto de Confirmaci\u00f3n de Fueros|Act for the Confirmation of the Fueros]]. It included a promise by the Spaniards to respect a reduced version of the previous Basque self-government. The pro-''fueros'' liberals strong at the moment in war and poverty stricken Pamplona confirmed most of the above arrangements, but signed the separate 1841 \"Compromise Act\" (''Ley Paccionada''), whereby Navarre ceased officially to exist as a kingdom and was made into a Spanish province, but keeping a set of important prerogatives, including control over taxation.\n\nCustoms were then definitely moved from the [[Ebro river]] over to the coast and the Pyrenees, which destroyed the formerly lucrative Bayonne-Pamplona trade and much of the region's prosperity.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|pp=149\u2013150}} The dismantling of the native political system had severe consequences throughout the Basque Country, leaving many families struggling to survive after the enforcement of the French Civil Code in the continental Basque region. The French legal arrangement deprived many families of their customary common lands and had their family property divided.<ref>Watson (2003), p. 149</ref>\n\nThe new political design triggered also cross-border smuggling, and French [[Basque American|Basques emigrated to the USA]] and other American destinations in large numbers. They account for about half of the total emigration from France during the 19th century, estimated at 50.000 to 100.000 inhabitants.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=151}} The same fate&mdash;North and South America altogether&mdash;was followed by many other Basques, who during the following decades set out from Basque and other neighbouring ports (Santander, Bordeaux) in search for a better life, e.g. the bard Jose Maria Iparragirre, composer of the ''[[Gernikako Arbola]]'', widely held as the Basque national anthem. In 1844, the [[Guardia Civil|Civil Guard]], a paramilitary police force (cited in Iparragirre's popular song ''Zibilak esan naute''), was established with a view to defend and spread the idea of a Spanish central state, particularly in rural areas, while the 1856 education reform consciously promoted the use of the Castilian (Spanish) language.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe economic scene in the [[French Basque Country]], badly affected by war developments up to 1814 and intermittently cut off since 1793 from its customary trade flow with fellow Basque districts to the south, was languid and marked by small scale exploitation of natural resources in the rural milieu, e.g. mining, salt extraction, farming and wool processing, flour mills, etc. Bayonne remained the main trade hub, while Biarritz thrived as a seaside tourist resort for the elites ([[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress Eugenie]]'s venue in 1854). During this period, [[\u00c1lava]] and Navarre showed little economic dynamism, remaining largely attached to rural activity with a small middle-class based in the capital cities&mdash;[[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] and [[Pamplona]].\n\nThe centuries long [[forge]] (ironwork) network linked to readily available timber, abundant waterways, and proximity of coastal harbours saw its final agony, but some kept operating&mdash;north of Navarre, Gipuzkoa, [[Biscay]]. A critical moment for the development of heavy metal industry came with the introduction in 1855 of [[Bessemer process|Bessemer blast furnaces]] for the mass-production of steel in the [[Bilbao]] area. In 1863 the [[Juntas Generales|Regional Council of Biscay]] liberalized the exportation of iron ore, and in the same year the first mining railway line was pressed into operation. A rapid development followed, encouraged by a dynamic local bourgeoisie, coastal location, availability of technical know-how, an inflow of foreign steel industry investors&mdash;partnering with a local family owned group ''Ybarra y C\u00eda''&mdash;as well as Spanish and foreign high demand for iron ore. The transfer of the Spanish customs border from the southern boundary of the Basque Country to the Spanish-French border ultimately encouraged the inclusion of Spain's Basque districts in a new Spanish market, the protectionism of which favoured in that respect the birth and growth of Basque industry.\n\nThe ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Norte'' railway company, a [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier|Credit Mobilier]] franchise,{{Sfnp|L\u00f3pez-Morell|1990|pp=155-156}} arrived at the bordering town of [[Irun]] in 1865, while the French railway cut its way along the Basque coast all the way to [[Hendaye]] in 1864 ([[Bayonne]] in 1854). The arrival of the railway was to have a deep social, economic and cultural impact, sparking both admiration and opposition. With the expansion of the railway network, industry also developed in [[Gipuzkoa]] following a different pattern&mdash;slower, distributed across different valleys, and centred on metallic manufacturing and processing, thanks to local expertise and entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the run-up to the [[Third Carlist War|Third (Second) Carlist War]] (1872-1876), the implementation of the treaties concluding the First Carlist War was faced with tensions arising from the Spanish Government's attempt to alter by ''faits accomplis'' the spirit and print of the agreements in respect of finances and taxation, the crowning jewels of the Southern Basque Country's separate status along with the specificity of the military draft. Following the instability of the I Spanish Republic (1868) and the struggle for dynastic succession in Madrid, by 1873 the Carlists made themselves strong in Navarre and expanded their territorial grip all over the [[Southern Basque Country]] except for the capital cities, establishing ''de facto'' a Basque state with a seat in [[Estella-Lizarra]], where claimant to the throne [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]] had settled. The ruling Carlist government included not only judiciary arrangements for military matters but the establishment of civil tribunals, as well as its own currency and stamps.\n\nHowever, the [[Carlism|Carlists]] failed to capture the four capitals in the territory, bringing about attrition and the gradual collapse of Carlist military strength starting in summer 1875. Other theatres of war in Spain (Castile, Catalonia) were no exception, with the Carlists undergoing a wide number of setbacks that contributed to the eventual victory of King [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]]'s Spanish army. Its columns advanced and took over Irun and [[Estella-Lizarra]] by February 1876. This time the rising Spanish Prime Minister [[Canovas del Castillo]] stated that no agreement bound him, and went on to decree the \"Act for the Abolition of the Basque Charters\", with its 1st article proclaiming the \"duties the political Constitution has always imposed on all the Spanish.\" The Basque districts in Spain including Navarre lost their sovereignty and were assimilated to the Spanish provinces, still preserving a small set of prerogatives (the [[Basque Economic Agreement]]s, and the 1841 Compromise Act for Navarre).\n\n==Late Modern history==\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[Image:NafarForuak.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial erected in [[Pamplona]] to the traditional [[Fueros of Navarre|Laws of Navarre]] (1903): \"We, the Basques of today, in memory of our eternal ancestors, have gathered here to show our determination to keep Our Laws\"]]\n[[File:Chateau d Abbadie.jpg|thumb|Antoine d'Abbadie's castle in [[Hendaye]]]]\n\nThe loss of the Charters in 1876 spawned political dissent and unrest, with two traditionalist movements arising to counter the Spanish centralist and comparatively liberal stance, the Carlists and the Basque nationalists. The former emphasized staunchly catholic and absolutist values, while the latter stressed Catholicism and the charters mingled with a Basque national awareness (Jaungoikoa eta Lege Zarra). Besides showing at the beginning slightly different positions, the Basque nationalists took hold in the industrialised Biscay and to a lesser extent Gipuzkoa, while the Carlist entrenched themselves especially in the rural Navarre and to a lesser extent in \u00c1lava.\n\nWith regards to the economic activity, high quality iron ore mainly from western Biscay, processed up to the early 19th century in small traditional ironworks around the western Basque Country, was now exported to Britain for industrial processing (see section above). Between 1878 and 1900 58 million tons of ore were exported from the Basque Country to Great Britain. The profits gained in this exportation was in turn reinvested by local entrepreneurs in iron and steel industry, a move spurring an \"industrial revolution\" that was to spread from Bilbao and the Basque Country across Spain, despite the economic incompetence shown by the Spanish central government.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=273}}\n\nFollowing up economic developments started in mid-19th century and given the momentum of the Spanish internal market after the end of the ''fueros'', Biscay developed its own modern [[blast furnaces]] and heavier mining, while industrialization took off in Gipuzkoa. The large numbers of workers which both required were initially drawn from the Basque countryside and the peasantry of nearby Castile and Rioja, but increasingly immigration began to flow from the remoter impoverished regions of Galicia and Andalusia. The Basque Country, hitherto a source of emigrants to France, Spain and America, faced for the first time in recent history the prospect of a massive influx of foreigners possessing different languages and cultures as a side-effect of industrialisation. Most of these immigrants spoke Spanish; practically all were very poor.\n\nThe French railway arrived at Hendaye (Hendaia) in 1864, so connecting Madrid and Paris. The railway provision for the Basque coast entailed not only a more fluent freight shipping, but a quicker expansion of the seaside spa model of [[Biarritz]] to [[Donostia]], providing a steady flow of tourists, elitist first and middle class later&mdash;especially from Madrid. Not only that, a regular immigration of administration and customs officials from the French and Spanish heartlands ensued, ignorant of local culture and often reluctant, even hostile to Basque language. However, meanwhile, prominent figures concerned with the decay of Basque culture started to promote initiatives aimed at enhancing its status and development, e.g. the renowned [[Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie|Antoine d'Abbadie]], a major driving force behind the ''Lore Jokoak'' literary and cultural festivals, with the liberal Donostia also becoming a vibrant hotspot for Basque culture, featuring figures such as [[Serafin Baroja]], poet-[[bertsolari|troubadour]] [[Bilintx]], or play-writer Ramon Maria Labaien.\n\nIn this period, Biscay reached one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. While the new proletariat's wretched working and living conditions were providing a natural breeding ground for the new socialist and anarchist ideologies and political movements characteristic of the late 19th century, the end of the 19th century also saw the birth of the above [[Basque nationalism]]. The Spanish government's failure to comply with the provisions established at the end of the [[Third Carlist War]] (1876) and before (the 1841 ''Compromise Act'' in Navarre) raised a public outcry, crystallizing in the ''Gamazada'' popular uprising in Navarre (1893-1894) that provided a springboard for the incipient Basque nationalism<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/60321 |title=La Gamazada |author=Idoia Estornes Zubizarreta |date= |website=Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia|publisher= EuskoMedia Fundazioa|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>&mdash;[[EAJ-PNV|Basque Nationalist Party]] founded in 1895.\n\nThe PNV, pursuing the goal of independence or self-government for a Basque state (''Euzkadi''), represented an ideology which combined [[Christian Democracy|Christian-Democratic]] ideas with abhorrence towards Spanish immigrants whom they perceived as a threat to the ethnic, cultural and linguistic integrity of the Basque race while also serving as a channel for the importation of new-fangled, leftist (and \"un-Basque\") ideas.\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIndustrialisation across the Atlantic basin Basque districts (Biscay, Gipuzkoa, north-western \u00c1lava) was further boosted by the outbreak of World War I in Europe. Spain remained neutral in the war conflict, with Basque steel production and export further expanding thanks to the demand of the European war effort.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=273}} Ironically, the end of the European war in 1918 brought about the decline and transformation of the Basque industry. In the French Basque Country, its inhabitants were drafted to add to the French war effort. War took a heavy toll on the Basques, 6,000 died. It also significantly spurred the penetration of French nationalist ideas into Basque territory, limited to certain circles and contexts up to that point.\n\nIn 1931, at the outset of the Spanish 2nd Republic, echoing the recently granted self-government to [[Catalonia]], an attempt was made to draw up [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Estatuto_General_del_Estado_Vasco_aprobado_en_la_Magna_Asamblea_de_Municipios_Vascos_celebrada_en_Estella_(Lizarra)_el_d%C3%ADa_14_de_Junio_de_1931 a single statute] for the Basque territories in Spain ([[Southern Basque Country|''Provincias Vascongadas'' and ''Navarra'']]), but after an initial overwhelming approval of the draft and a round of council mayor meetings, [[Navarre]] [http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c22f3/index.php pulled out of the draft project] amidst heated controversy over the validity of the votes (Pamplona, 1932). Tellingly, the [[Carlism|Carlist]] council of Pamplona claimed that \"it is unacceptable to call [the territory included in the draft Statute] ''Pa\u00eds Vasco-Navarro'' in Spanish. It is fine ''Vasconia'', and ''Euskalerr\u00eda'', but not ''Euzkadi''\".{{Sfnp|Esparza|2012|p=20}}\n\nUndaunted, the [[Basque nationalist]]s and [[left-wing politics|leftist]] republican forces kept working on a statute, this time only for the Basque western provinces, \u00c1lava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, eventually approved in 1936, with the [[Spanish Civil War]] already raging and an effective control just over Biscay.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"135px\" heights=\"135px\">\nFile:Pasaiako San Roke.jpg|Launch of a boat at a shipyard in [[Pasaia]], Gipuzkoa (1920)\nFile:Jose Antonio Agirre Lekube speech in Basque Nationalism Meeting, 1933.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre (politician)|J.A.

(The latter were known in Spain as \"Nacionales\"&mdash;usually rendered in English as \"Nationalists\"&mdash;which can be highly misleading in the Basque context). However, Navarre especially was not spared. As soon as the rebels led by [[General Mola]] made themselves strong in the district, they initiated a terror campaign against blacklisted individuals aimed at purging the rearguard and break any glimmer of dissent. The confirmed death toll rose to 2,857, plus a further 305 in prison (malnutrition, ill-treatment, etc.);{{Sfnp|Preston|1990|pp=179-183}} victims and historic memory associations raise the figure to near 4,000.\n\nAnother big atrocity of this war, immortalised by Picasso's emblematic mural, was the [[Bombing of Guernica|bombing of Gernika]] by [[Legion Condor|German planes]], a [[Biscay]]ne town of great historical and symbolic importance, at Franco's bidding. In 1937, the [[Eusko Gudarostea]], the troops of the new government of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] surrendered to Franco's fascist [[Corpo Truppe Volontari|Italian allies]] in [[Santo\u00f1a]] on condition that the lives of the Basque soldiers were respected ([[Santo\u00f1a Agreement]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiru.com/historia/historia_07925.html |title=La Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola en Euskal Herria |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= Hiru |publisher= Basque Government's Department of Education, Language Policy and Culture|access-date=2015-11-15|quote=}}</ref> [[War in the North|Basques (Gipuzkoa, Biscay)]] fled for their lives to exile by the tens of thousands, including a [[Evacuation of children in the Spanish Civil War|mass evacuation of children]] aboard chartered boats (the ''ni\u00f1os de la guerra'') into permanent exile.\n\nWith the Spanish Civil War over, the new dictator began his drive to turn Spain into a totalitarian [[nation state]]. Franco's regime passed harsh laws against all minorities in the Spanish state, including Basques, aimed at wiping out their cultures and languages. Calling Biscay and Gipuzkoa \"traitor provinces\", he abolished what remained of their autonomy. Navarre and \u00c1lava were allowed to hang onto a [[miqueletes|small local police force]] and limited tax prerogatives.\n\nAfter 1937, the Basque territories remained behind the war lines, but the French Basque Country became a forced destination for fellow Basques from Spain fleeing war, only to find themselves confined in prisoner camps, such as [[Gurs internment camp|Gurs]] on the outer fringes of [[Soule]] ([[Basses Pyrenees]]). The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] established a [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German military occupation]] of the French Atlantic, including the French Basque Country up to [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], with the rest of it being falling on the [[Vichy France]]. The whole western and central Pyrenees became a hotspot for clandestine operations and organized resistance, e.g. [[Comet line]].\n\n===Franco's dictatorship===\nTwo developments during the Franco dictatorship (1939\u20131975) deeply affected life in the Basque Country in this period and afterward. One was a new wave of immigration from the poorer parts of Spain to Biscay and Gipuzkoa during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in response to the region's escalating industrialization aimed to supply the Spanish internal market as a result of a post-war self-sufficiency policy, favoured by the regime.\n\nSecondly, the regime's persecution provoked a strong backlash in the Basque Country from the 1960s onwards, notably in the form of a new political movement, [[ETA (separatist group)|Basque Country And Freedom]] (''Euskadi Ta Askatasuna''), better known by its Basque initials [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], who turned to the systematic use of arms as a form of protest in 1968. But ETA was only one component of a social, political and language movement rejecting Spanish domination but also sharply criticizing the inertia of the Basque Country's own conservative nationalists (organized in the PNV). To this day the dialectic between these two political trends, the ''Abertzale'' (patriotic or nationalist) Left and the PNV, dominate the nationalist part of the Basque political spectrum, the rest of which is occupied by non-nationalist parties.\n\n==Present==\n{{See also|Basque conflict}}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n|+ '''1978 SPANISH CONSTITUTION REFERENDUM'''\n|- style=\"background: #efefef;\"|\n!\n!

Two new stances arose in Basque politics, namely break or compromise. While ETA's different branches decided to keep confrontation to gain a new status for the Basque Country, PNV and the Spanish Communists and Socialists opted for negotiations with the Francoist regime. In 1978, a general pardon was decreed by the Spanish Government for all politics related offences, a decision affecting directly Basque nationalist activists, especially ETA militants. In the same year, the referendum to ratify the Spanish Constitution was held. The electoral platforms closer to ETA's two branches ([[Herri Batasuna]], [[Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia|EIA]]) advocated for a \"No\" option, while PNV called for abstention on the grounds that it had no Basque input. The results in the [[Southern Basque Country]] showed a conspicuous gap with other regions in Spain, especially in the Basque Autonomous Community.\n\nIn the 1970s and early/mid-1980s, the Basque Country was gripped by intense violence practised by Basque nationalist and state-sponsored illegal groups and police forces. Between 1979 and 1983, in the framework of the new Spanish Constitution, the central government granted wide self-governing powers (\"[[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country|autonomy]]\") to [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|\u00c1lava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa]] after a referendum on a Basque statute, including its own elected parliament, [[Ertzaintza|police force]], [[Basque education system|school system]], and control over taxation, while [[Navarre]] was left out of the new autonomous region after the Socialists backed down on their initial position, and it was made into a separate autonomous region. Thereafter, despite the difficulties facing, with overt long-time institutional and academic hostility in the French Basque Country<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/17/france |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Local language recognition angers French academy |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> and Navarre, Basque language education has grown to become a key actor in formal education at all levels.\n\nThe political events were accompanied by a collapse in the manufacturing industry in the Southern Basque Country following the 1973 and 1979 crises. The marked decay of the 1970s put an end to the ''baby boom'' and halted the internal Spanish immigration trend started in the postwar years. The crisis left the newly established Basque autonomous government from [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (led initially by [[Carlos Garaikoetxea]]) facing a major strategic challenge related to the dismantling of the traditional shipbuilding and steel industry now subject to open international competition. Economic confidence was largely restored during the mid-1990s when the autonomous government's bet on modernization of manufacturing, R+D based specialization, and quality tourism started to bear fruit, counting on flowing credit from local savings banks. Cross-border synergies between the French and Spanish side of the Basque Country have confirmed the territory as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nThe 1979 Statute of Autonomy is an organic law of mandatory implementation, but powers have been devolved gradually over decades as a result of re-negotiations between the Spanish and successive Basque regional governments according to after-electoral needs, while the transfer of many powers is still due. In January 2017, the first common administrative institution ever was established in the [[French Basque Country]], the [[Basque Municipal Community]] presided over by the mayor of [[Bayonne]] [[Jean-Ren\u00e9 Etchegaray]] and considered a 'historic' event by the representatives.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2017-01-02|title=Abian da Euskal Elkargoa [The Basque Community kicks off]|url=http://www.eitb.eus/eu/albisteak/politika/osoa/4571445/abian-da-euskal-elkargoa-ipar-euskal-herrian/|newspaper=EITB |location= |access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sabathl\u00e9 |first=Pierre|date=2017-01-23|title=Jean-Ren\u00e9 Etchegaray \u00e9lu pr\u00e9sident de la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019agglom\u00e9ration Pays basque|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2017/01/23/jean-rene-etchegaray-elu-president-de-la-communaute-d-agglomeration-pays-basque-3131534-4018.php|newspaper=SudOuest|location= |access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"135px\" heights=\"135px\">\nFile:Kilometroak beasain 1977 01.jpg|First edition of the [[Kilometroak]] festival in support of the [[ikastola]]s ([[Beasain]], 1977)\nFile:Muralbelfast2.jpg|A republican mural in Belfast showing solidarity with the [[Basque nationalism]]\nFile:Tram Vitoria-Gasteiz - 8 (8499898767).jpg|[[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] Tram in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] ([[Euskotren]])\nFile:-bakeruntz- armagabetze eguna Baionan (33942124005).jpg|Pro-peace rally in Bayonne on ETA's disarmament day (08/04/2017)\nFile:2017 04 07 lhk encuentro 09.jpg|Tripartite meeting of the three main Basque institutional representatives with peace broker [[Ram Manikkalingam]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Basques]]\n*[[Basque language]]\n*[[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]\n*[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]]\n*[[Navarre]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite web |url= http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi |title=Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia |publisher= EuskoMedia Fundazioa}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.ingeba.org/lurralde/lurranet/lur10/10campbel/10cambel.htm |title=The Century of the Basques: Their Influence in the Geography of the 1500's |last1=Campbell |first1=Craig S.|last2= |first2= |date=1987 |website=Lurralde|publisher=Ingeba}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cavalli-Sforza|first=Luigi Luca|title=Genes, Pueblos y Lenguas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j00kUja-eysC|date=1 June 2000|publisher=Editorial Critica|isbn=978-84-8432-084-5}}\n*{{cite web|last=Cavalli-Sforza|first=Luigi Luca|title=European Genetic Variation|url=http://www.sitesled.com/members/racialreality/genetic_variation.html|work=Online maps|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205101830/http://www.sitesled.com/members/racialreality/genetic_variation.html|archivedate=5 December 2006}}\n*{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=The Basques|year=1990|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0631175652|edition=2nd}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Douglass|first1=William A.|last2=Douglass|first2=Bilbao, J.|date=2005 |title=Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KzfK1QwxDIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada Press |isbn=0-87417-625-5}}\n*{{cite book|last=Esparza Zabalegi|first=Jose Mari|title=Euskal Herria Kartografian eta Testigantza Historikoetan | year=2012 | publisher=Euskal Editorea SL | isbn=978-84-936037-9-3}}\n*{{cite book |title= Historia de Pamplona y de sus Lenguas|last=Jimeno Jurio |first=Jose Maria|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995|publisher= Txalaparta |location= Tafalla |isbn=84-8136-017-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnL4obRRmo8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q=803&f=false}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kamen|first1=Henry|last2=|first2=|date=2001 |title=Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htkqJr0SThsC&pg=PP4&lpg=PP4&dq=Philip+V+of+Spain:+The+King+who+Reigned+Twice+kamen&source=bl&ots=CJHegeffQI&sig=e8iDJOdEpJm2jKQ6Lbpt49r-8fw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H_xYVO_mN9HUauuLgIgB&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Philip%20V%20of%20Spain%3A%20The%20King%20who%20Reigned%20Twice%20kamen&f=false|location=|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-30008-718-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|title=Basque History Of The World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQpfod-EQDsC&pg=PT32|date=11 March 2011|publisher=Knopf Canada|isbn=978-0-307-36978-9}}\n*Larrea, Juan Jos\u00e9.

Their history is therefore interconnected with Spanish and French history and also with the history of many other past and present countries, particularly in Europe and the [[Americas]], where a large number of [[Basque diaspora|their descendants]] keep attached to their roots, clustering around [[Basque center|Basque clubs]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|Origin of the Basques}}\n\n===First historical references===\n[[Image:Basque tribes.gif|thumb|right|250px|Location of the ancient tribes<br /> \u00b7Red: Theorized as Basque, [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes<br /> \u00b7Blue: Proven [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes]]\n\nIn the 1st century, [[Strabo]] wrote that the northern parts of what are now [[Navarre]] (''Nafarroa'' in Basque) and [[Aragon]] were inhabited by the [[Vascones]]. Despite the evident etymological connection between ''Vascones'' and the modern denomination ''Basque'', there is no direct proof that the Vascones were the modern Basques' ancestors or spoke the language that has evolved into modern [[Basque language|Basque]], although this is strongly suggested both by the historically consistent toponymy of the area and by a few personal names on tombstones dating from the Roman period.\n\nThree different peoples inhabited the territory of the present [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]]: the [[Varduli]], [[Caristii]] and [[Autrigones]]. Historical sources do not state whether these tribes were related to the [[Vascones]], the [[Aquitani]], pre-indoeuropean people or the [[Celts]]. The area where a Basque-related language is best attested from an early period is [[Gascony]] in France, to the north of the present-day Basque region, whose ancient inhabitants, the [[Aquitani]], spoke a language related to Basque.{{Efn|The extinct [[Aquitanian language]] should not be confused with [[Gascon language|Gascon]], the Romance language that has been spoken in Aquitaine since the Middle Ages.}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nAlthough little is known about the prehistory of the Basques before the period of Roman occupation owing to the difficulty in identifying evidence for specific cultural traits, the mainstream view today is that the Basque area shows signs of archaeological continuity since the [[Aurignacian]] period.\n\nMany Basque archaeological sites, including cave dwellings such as [[Santimami\u00f1e]], provide evidence for continuity from Aurignacian times down to the [[Iron Age]], shortly before Roman occupation. The possibility therefore cannot be ruled out of at least some of the same people having continued to inhabit the area for thirty millennia.\n\nSome scholars have interpreted the Basque words ''aizto'' 'knife' and ''aizkora'' 'axe' as containing ''aitz'' 'stone', which they take as evidence that the Basque language dates back to the [[Paleolithic|Stone Age]].{{Sfnp|Kurlansky|2011|p=32}} However, stone was abandoned in the [[Chalcolithic]], and ''aizkora'' (variants ''axkora'', ''azkora'') is sometimes considered to be [[loanword|loaned]] from Latin ''asciola''; cf. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''azuela'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''aixol''.{{Sfnp|Oroz|1999|p=502}}\n\n====Genetic evidence====\n{{see also|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups}}\nA high concentration of [[Rh-]] among Basques, who have the highest level worldwide, had already been interpreted as suggestive of the antiquity and lack of admixture of the Basque genetic stock. In the 1990s [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] published his findings according to which one of the main European [[autosomal]] [[principal components|components]], PC 5, was shown to be a typically Basque trait believed to have receded owing to the migration of Eastern peoples during the [[Neolithic]] and [[Metal Ages]].{{Sfnp|Cavalli-Sforza|2000|pp=??}}{{Sfnp|Cavalli-Sforza|2006|pp=??}}<ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/7/1361 ''Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans'', Isabelle Dupanloup et al.]</ref>\n\n[[X chromosome]] [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s<ref>[http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/8/12/1289 ''MS205 Minisatellite Diversity in Basques: Evidence for a Pre-Neolithic Component'', Santos Alonso and John A.L.

The only archaeological evidence that could partly support this hypothesis would be that for the [[Ebro]] valley area.\n*Basques arrived together with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]: Linked to an unproven linguistic hypothesis that includes Basque and some [[Caucasian languages]] in a single super-family. Even if such a Basque-Caucasian connection did exist, it would have to be at too great a time depth to be relevant to Indo-European migrations. Apart from a [[Celts|Celtic]] presence in the Ebro valley during the [[Urnfield culture]], archaeology offers little support for this hypothesis. The [[Basque language]] shows few certain Celtic or other Indo-European loans, other than those transmitted via Latin or Romance in historic times.\n*Basques as an Iberian subgroup: Based on occasional use by early Basques of the Iberian alphabet and [[Julius Caesar]]'s description of the [[Aquitaine|Aquitanians]] as ''[[Iberians]]''. Apparent similarities between the undeciphered [[Iberian language]] and Basque have also been cited, but this fails to account for the fact that attempts so far to decipher Iberian using Basque as a reference have failed.\n\n===New genetic findings, 2015===\nIn 2015, a new scientific study of Basque DNA was published which seems to indicate that Basques are descendants of Neolithic farmers who mixed with local hunters before becoming genetically isolated from the rest of Europe for millennia.<ref name=\"thescientist\">[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43950/title/Ancient-DNA-Elucidates-Basque-Origins/ Ancient DNA Elucidates Basque Origins].

The settlers brought the [[Aurignacian]] culture with them.\n\nAt this stage, the Basque Country formed part of the archaeological [[Franco-Cantabric region|Franco-Cantabrian province]] which extended all the way from [[Asturias]] to [[Provence]]. Throughout this region, which underwent similar cultural developments with some local variation, Aurignacian culture was successively replaced by [[Gravettian]], [[Solutrean]], and [[Magdalenian]] cultures. Except for the Aurignacian, these all seem to have originated in the Franco-Cantabrian region, which suggests no further waves of immigration into the area during the Paleolithic period.\n\nWithin the present-day Basque Country, settlement was limited almost exclusively to the Atlantic area, probably for climatic reasons. Important Basque sites include the following:\n\n*[[Santimami\u00f1e]] (Biscay): Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian remains, mural art\n*Bolinkoba (Biscay): Gravettian and Solutrean\n*Ermitia (Gipuzkoa): Solutrean and Magdalenian\n*Amalda (Gipuzkoa): Gravettian and Solutrean\n*Koskobilo (Gipuzkoa): Aurignacian and Solutrean\n*Aitzbitarte (Gipuzkoa): Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian\n*Isturitz (Lower Navarre): Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian, mural art\n*Gatzarria (Soule): Aurignacian and Gravettian\n\n===Epipaleolithic and Neolithic===\nAt the end of the [[Ice Age]], Magdalenian culture gave way to [[Azilian]] culture. Hunters turned from large animals to smaller prey, and fishing and seafood gathering became important economic activities. The southern part of the Basque Country was first settled in this period.\n\nGradually, Neolithic technology started to filter through from the Mediterranean coasts, first in the form of isolated pottery items (Zatoia, Marizulo) and later with the introduction of [[shepherd|sheepherding]]. As in most of Atlantic Europe, this transition progressed slowly.\n\nIn the Ebro valley, more fully Neolithic sites are found. [[Anthropometry|Anthropometric]] classification of the remains suggests the possibility of some Mediterranean colonisation here. A comparable situation is found in Aquitaine, where settlers may have arrived via the [[Garonne]].\n\nIn the second half of the 4th millennium BC, [[Megalith|Megalithic culture]] appeared throughout the area. Burials become collective (possibly implying families or clans) and the [[dolmen]] predominates, while caves are also employed in some places. Unlike the dolmens of the Mediterranean basin which show a preference for corridors, in the Atlantic area they are invariably simple chambers.\n\n===Copper and Bronze Ages===\n[[Image:Harrespil Okabe.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Stone circles|Cromlech]]'' of Okabe ([[Lower Navarre]])]]\n[[File:La Hoyako oin biribileko etxe baten maketa. La Hoyako bizilekuaren irudia, Biasterin (Araba).PNG|thumb|Typical round shack and settlement of La Hoya on the Ebro banks (\u00c1lava)]]\n\nUse of copper and gold, and then other metals, did not begin in the Basque Country until c. 2500. With the arrival of metal working, the first urban settlements made their appearance. One of the most notable towns on account of its size and continuity was [[La Hoya, Alava|La Hoya]] in southern \u00c1lava, which may have served as a link, and possibly a trading centre, between [[Portugal]] ([[Vila Nova de S\u00e3o Pedro]] culture) and [[Languedoc]] (Treilles group). Concurrently, caves and natural shelters remained in use, particularly in the Atlantic region.\n\nUndecorated pottery continued from the Neolithic period up until the arrival of the [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]] with its characteristic pottery style, which is mainly found around the Ebro Valley. Building of megalithic structures continued until the Late Bronze Age.\n\nIn Aquitaine, there was a notable presence of the [[Artenacian culture]], a culture of bowmen that spread rapidly through Western France and Belgium from its homeland near the Garonne c. 2400.\n\nIn the Late Bronze Age, parts of the southern Basque Country came under the influence of the pastoralist [[Cogotas]] I culture of the Iberian plateau.\n\n===Iron Age===\nIn the [[European Iron Age|Iron Age]], bearers of the late [[Urnfield culture]] followed the Ebro upstream as far as the southern fringes of the Basque Country, leading to the incorporation of the [[Hallstatt culture]]; this corresponds to the beginning of Indo-European, notably [[Celts|Celtic]] influence in the region.\n\nIn the Basque Country, settlements now appear mainly at points of difficult access, probably for defensive reasons, and had elaborate defense systems. During this phase, agriculture seemingly became more important than [[animal husbandry]].\n\nIt may be during this period that new megalithic structures, the (stone circle) or ''[[Stone circles|cromlech]]'' and the megalith or ''[[menhir]]'', made their appearance.\n\n==Roman rule==\n[[File:Torre de Urkulu.jpg|thumb|250px|Tower of [[Urkulu]], a commemorative Roman tower]]\n[[File:Iru\u00f1a Veleia 1.JPG|thumb|250px|Reconstruction at the site of [[Iru\u00f1a-Veleia]], in central \u00c1lava]]\nOn arrival of the Romans to current south-west France, the Pyrenees and its threshold up to Cantabria, the territory was occupied by a number of tribes, most of them non Indo-European (the nature of others remain unclear, e.g. the Caristii). The [[Vascones]] show the closest identification with current Basques, but evidence points to Basque-like people extending around the [[Pyrenees]] and up to the Garonne, as evidenced by Caesar\u00b4s testimony on his book ''De Bello Gallico'', [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] inscriptions (person and god names), and several place-names.\n\nMost of the Aquitanian tribes were subjugated by Crasus, lieutenant of Caesar, in 65 BC. However, prior to this conquest (celebrated apparently, on the [[Urkulu|Tower of Urkulu]]), the Romans had reached the upper Ebro region at the beginning of the 2nd century BC, on the fringes of the Basque territory (Calagurris, Graccurris). Under [[Pompey]] in the 1st century BC, the Romans stationed in and founded Pompaelo (modern [[Pamplona]], ''Iru\u00f1ea'' in Basque) but Roman rule was not consolidated until the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]]. Its laxness suited the Basques well, allowing them to retain their traditional laws and leadership. Romanisation was limited on the lands of the current Basque Country closer to the Atlantic, while it was more intense on the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]]. The survival of the separate Basque language has often been attributed to the fact that Basque Country was little developed by the Romans.\n\nThere was a significant Roman presence in the garrison of Pompaelo, a city south of the Pyrenees founded by and named after Pompey. Conquest of the area further west followed a fierce Roman campaign against the [[Cantabri]] (see [[Cantabrian Wars]]). There are archaeological remains from this period of [[garrison]]s protecting commercial routes all along the Ebro river, and along a [[Roman road]] between [[Astorga (Spain)|Asturica]] and [[Burdigala]].\n\nA unit of [[Varduli]] was stationed on [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the north of Britain for many years, and earned the title ''fida'' (faithful) for service to the Emperor. Romans apparently entered into alliances (''foedera'', singular ''foedus'') with many local tribes, allowing them almost total autonomy within the Empire.<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/8809?op=4&primR=1&regs=10&idi=eu&EIKVOGEN=Imperio%20Romano&pos=2 Alianzas (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref>\n\n[[Livy]] mentions the natural division between the ''Ager'' and the ''Saltus Vasconum'', i.e. between the fields of the [[Ebro]] basin and the mountains to the north.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} It has been held by historians that Romanisation was significant in the fertile ''Ager'' but almost null in the ''Saltus'', where Roman towns were scarce and generally small.<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/120795?op=4&primR=1&regs=10&idi=eu&EIKVOGEN=Ager%20Vasconum&pos=7 Saltus Vasconum (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref> However, the latest 21st century findings have called into question that assumption, highlighting the importance of fishing (fish processing factories, ''caetariae'') and mining sector on the Atlantic arch (the Atlantic route of cabotage), as well as other settlements dotting the Atlantic basin.\n\nThe [[Bagaudae]]<ref name=\"Bagaudas\">[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/10102?op=4&primR=1&regs=10&idi=eu&EIKVOGEN=Bagaudas&pos=4 Bagaudas (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref> seem to have produced a major impact on Basque history in the late Empire. In the late 4th century and throughout the 5th century, the Basque region from the [[Garonne]] to the [[Ebro]] escaped Roman control in the midst of revolts. Several Roman villas (Li\u00e9dena, Ramalete) were burned to the ground. The proliferation of mints is interpreted as evidence for an ''inner [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' around [[Vasconia]], where coins were minted for the purpose of paying troops.{{Sfnp|Sorauren|1998|pp=??}} After the fall of the Empire, the struggle against Rome's [[Visigoth]] allies continued.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Christianization===\n[[File:Ascain - pont romain.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman bridge in [[Ascain|Ascain (Azkaine)]]]]\n[[File:Euskal Hilarri Diskoidalak, San Telmo museoa, Donostia.jpg|thumb|250px|Medieval stellae collection exhibited at the San Telmo Museum, [[Donostia]]]]\nDespite early Christian testimonies and institutional organization, Basque Christianization was slow. The Basques hung onto their own pagan religion and beliefs (later transfigured into mythology), and were Christianized at a par with the [[Germanic peoples]] hostile to [[Carolingian]] expansion (8-9th century), such as the Saxons. However, it remained a slow internal process that some scholars have extended up to the 15th century.\n\nThe Christian poet [[Prudentius]] sings to the prominent Vasconic town of [[Calahorra]] in his work ''Peristephanon'' (I) written in the early 5th century, reminding to the town's \"one-time pagan [[Vascones]]\" of the martyrdom gone through in it formerly (305). Calahorra itself became episcopal see in the 4th century, with its bishop holding an authority over a territory that extended well into the lands of present-day central [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]] (''Sierra de Cameros''), [[Bizkaia|Biscay]], [[\u00c1lava]], a large part of [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]]. In the 5th century, [[Eauze]] (Elusa) is attested as episcopal see in the [[Novempopulania]], but the actual influence of these centres on the different domains of the society is not well known.\n\nThe collapse of the Roman Empire seems to have turned the tide. Basques are not identified anymore with Roman civilisation and its declining urban life after the late 5th century, and they prevailed over Roman urban culture, so that paganism remained widespread among the Basques at least up to the late 7th century and the failed mission of [[Saint Amandus]].{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=104}} However, less than a century later, no reference is made by Frankish chroniclers to Basque paganism in the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Frankish assault on Basques and Aquitanians]], despite its powerful propaganda value, [[Odo of Aquitaine|Odo]] was even recognised as champion of Christianity by the Pope.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Charlemagne]] started a policy of colonisation in Aquitaine and Vasconia after the submission of both territories in 768-769. Enlisting the Church on his side to strengthen his power in Vasconia, he restored Frankish authority on the high Pyrenees in 778, divided the land between bishops and abbots and began to baptize the pagan Basques of this region.{{Sfnp|Lewis|1965|p=39}}\n\nMuslim accounts from the period of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] and beginning of 9th century identify the Basques as ''magi'' or 'pagan wizards', they were not considered 'people of the Book' (Christians).{{Sfnp|Jimeno Jurio|1995|p=47}} Still in 816, Muslim chroniclers attest not far from Pamplona a so-called 'Saltan', \"knight of the pagans\", certainly a distorted name maybe referring to Zaldun, literally in Basque \"Knight\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Later Muslim historians cite Navarrese leaders of the early 9th century (but not only them) as holding onto polytheist religious practices and criticize the [[Banu Qasi]] for allying with them.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Further|Duchy of Vasconia}}\nIn 409, [[Vandals]], [[Alans]], and [[Suevi]] forced their way into Hispania through the western Pyrenees, chased closely by the Visigoths in 416 as allies of Rome, while the consequences of their advances are not clear.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=70\u201371}} In 418 Rome gave the provinces of [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]] and [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Tarraconensis]] to the [[Visigoths]], as ''[[foederati]]'', probably with a view to defending [[Novempopulana]] from the raids of the [[Bagaudae]]. It has sometimes been argued that the Basque were underlying these roving armed hosts, but this claim is far from certain. The contemporary chronicler Hydatius was well aware of the existence of ''the Vasconias'', but does not identify the Bagaudae rebels as Basque.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=72}}\n\nWhile the Visigoths seem to have claimed the Basque territory from an early date, the chronicles point to their failure to subdue it, punctuated only by sporadic military successes. The years between 435 and 450 saw a succession of confrontations between the Bagaudae and Romano-Gothic troops, the best documented of which were the battles of [[Toulouse]], [[Uharte-Arakil|Araceli]], and [[Tarazona|Turiasum]].<ref name=\"Bagaudas\"/> Just about the same period, in 449-51, the Suevi under their king [[Rechiar]] ravaged the territories of the Vascones, probably looting their way through the region on their way back home from Toulouse. Settlements were clearly damaged after the raids and, while [[Calahorra]] and Pamplona survived, Iru\u00f1a (Veleia) seems to have been abandoned as a result.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=76}}\n\nAfter 456, the Visigoths crossed the Pyrenees twice from Aquitaine, probably at [[Roncesvalles]], in an effort to destroy the Suevic kingdom of Rechiar, but as the chronicle of [[Hydatius]], the only Spanish source of the period, ends in 469, the actual events of the Visigothic confrontation with the Basques are obscure.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=81\u201382}} Apart from the vanished previous tribal boundaries, the great development between the death of Hydatius and the events accounted for in the 580s is the appearance of the Basques as a \"mountain roaming people\", most of the times depicted as posing a threat to urban life.\n\nThe [[Franks]] displaced the Visigoths from Aquitaine in 507, placing the Basques between the two warring kingdoms. In 581 or thereabouts both Franks and Visigoths attacked ''Vasconia'' (''Wasconia'' in [[Gregory of Tours]]), but neither with success. In 587 the Franks launched a second attack on the Basques, but they were defeated on the plains of Aquitaine, implying that Basque settlement or conquest had begun north of the Pyrenees.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=85\u201387}} However, the theory of a Basque expansionism in the Early Middle Ages has often been dismissed and is not necessary to understand the historic evolution of this region.{{Sfnp|Larrea/Bonnassie|1998|pp=123-129}} Soon afterwards, the Franks and Goths created their respective [[marches]] in order to contain the Basques  \u0336  the [[Duchy of Cantabria]] in the south and the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] in the north (602).{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=91}}\n\nIn the south-western marches of the Frankish Duchy of Vasconia, extending at certain periods during the 6-8th centuries across the Pyrenees,{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=93\u201395}} Cantabria (maybe including Biscay and \u00c1lava) and Pamplona remained out of Visigothic rule, with the latter sticking to either self-rule or under Frankish suzerainty (Councils of Toledo unattended between 589 and 684).\n\nAfter much fighting, the Duchy of Vasconia was consolidated as an independent polity between 660 and 678 ruled by the [[Duke of Aquitaine|duke]] Felix, who by means of a personal union with the [[Aquitaine#Early Middle Ages|Duchy of Aquitaine]] established a ''de facto'' realm detached from the distant Merovingian rule. Synergies between \u2018Roman\u2019, non-Frankish urban elites and a rural militarised Vascon power base enabled a strong political entity in south-west Gaul. The Basque-Aquitanian realm reached its zenith at the time of [[Odo the Great]], but the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim invasion]] of 711, at which time the Visigoth [[Roderic]] was fighting the Basques in Pamplona, and the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] posed new threats for this state, eventually spurring its downfall and breakup.\n[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|thumb|250px|The Duchy of Vasconia and neighbouring territories (740)]]\nVasconia's submission to the Franks after Odo\u2019s death in 735 was interrupted by frequent outbreaks of resistance, led by the latter\u2019s son [[Hunald I of Aquitaine|Hunald]] (735-744) and grandson [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]] (+768). In 762, the hosts of Frankish king Pippin crossed the Loire, attacked [[Bourges]] and [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] defended by the Basques and ransacked Aquitaine. After several military setbacks, the Basques pledged submission to Pippin on the river Garonne ([[Fronsac, Gironde|Fronsac]], c. 769). At this time (7-8th centuries), Vasconia is sometimes mentioned as stretching from the lands of Cantabria in the south-west all the way to the river Loire in the north pointing to a not preponderant but clearly significant Basque presence in Aquitaine (i.e. between Garonne and Loire).\n\n[[File:North and south of the Pyrenees (Year 760).jpg|250px|thumb|Duchy of Vasconia and both sides of the Pyrenees (760)]]\n\nVasconia\u2019s newly suppressed resistance cleared the way for the Frankish army to deal with [[Charlemagne]]\u2019s interests in the Spanish marches (siege of Zaragoza). After pulling down the walls of Pamplona, Roland's rear guard headed north and were defeated in the first [[Battle of Roncevaux]] (778) by the ''treacherous'' Basques, as put by Frankish chroniclers, suggesting that the Basques overall and duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus]] backed down on their 769 allegiance vow. After 781, tired of the Basque uprisings, Charlemagne appointed no more dukes, instead opting for a direct rule by creating the Kingdom of Aquitaine.\n\nThe Basque-Muslim state of the [[Banu Qasi]] (meaning \"heirs of Cassius\" in Arabic), founded c. 800 near [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] (''Tutera'' in Basque), acted as a buffer state between the Basques and the Cordovan Umayyads that helped consolidate the independent Kingdom of Pamplona after the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|second Battle of Roncevaux]], when a Frankish expedition led by the counts Eblus and Aznar (sometimes identified as [[Aznar Galindez I|the local Frankish vassal toppled in Aragon]] some 10 years earlier) was defeated by the Pamplonese and maybe the Banu Qasi,<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/38128?op=4&primR=21&regs=10&idi=en&EIKVOGEN=Ducado%20Vasconia&pos=25 Ducado de Vasconia (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia)]</ref> after crossing the Pyrenees, probably in the wake of Basque rebellions north of the Pyrenees.

The line of the Aristas ruled Pamplona side by side with the Banu Qasi of Tudela up to the decline of both dynasties (early 10th century). When [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho I Garces]] rose to prominence in 905, Pamplonese allegiances switched to their neighbour Christian realms, with the new royal lineage starting its expansion south to the territory of their former allies.\n\nIn 844, the Vikings sailed up the Garonne to Bordeaux and Toulouse and raided the countryside on either bank of the river, killing the Duke of the Basques [[Seguin II of Gascony|Sigwinum II]] (recorded as Sihiminum too, maybe Semeno) in Bordeaux. They took over Bayonne, and attacked Pamplona (859), even taking the king Garcia prisoner, only released in exchange for a hefty ransom. They were to be overcome only in 982 by the Basque duke [[William II Sanchez of Gascony]], who made his way back from Pamplona to fight to the north of Bayonne and put a term to Viking incursions, so allowing monasteries to spring up all over Gascony thereafter,{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=132}} the first of which was the one of [[Saint-Sever]], ''Caput Vasconiae''.\n\nWilliam started a policy of rapprochement to Pamplona, by establishing dynastic ties with their rulers. Despite its newly found strength, by the 10th century the territory of Vasconia (to become [[Gascony]] and stripped by the 11th\u201312th centuries of its original ethnic sense) fragmented into different feudal regions, for example, the viscountcies of [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]] out of former tribal systems and minor realms ([[County of Vasconia]]), while south of the Pyrenees the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] and the Pyrenean counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]] (later merged into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]) and [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] arose as the main regional powers with Basque population in the 9th century.\n\n===High Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Navarre}}\n[[Image:Kingdom of Pamplona (c. 925).gif|thumb|250px|The Kingdom of Pamplone in the early 10th century]]\n[[File:Londresko laudoa - Laudo de Londres (1176-1177).jpg|thumb|250px|The Navarrese territories circa 1179]]\n\nUnder [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho III the Great]], Pamplona controlled the entire southern Basque Country. Actually, its power extended from [[Burgos]] and [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] to northern [[Aragon]]. Through marriage Sancho also became the acting [[List of Castilian Monarchs|Earl of Castile]] and held a protectorate over [[Gascony]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]]. However, in 1058, the former [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] turned into Gascony, merged by personal union with Aquitaine ([[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII]]). William VIII intervened on the dynastic struggles taking place in Arag\u00f3n and other Peninsular kingdoms, but Gascony progressively moved away from the Basque political sphere, just as its own ethnic make-up: the Basque people increasingly turned into [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] on the plains to the north of the central and west Pyrenees.\n\nFollowing Sancho III's death, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and Aragon became separate kingdoms ruled by his sons, who were responsible for the first partitioning of Pamplona (1076). Pamplona, the main Basque kingdom (to be renamed Navarre), was absorbed and dwindled for the benefit of Arag\u00f3n. The kingdom of Arag\u00f3n itself expanded from its Pyrenean stronghold to the Ebro valley (Saragossa and Tudela conquered in 1118), so shifting its power base to the lowlands and urban areas, with the Basque language and culture receding at the pressure of the stronger urban population and Latin (and Arabic) civilization's prestige encountered at the Ebro valley. Basque ceased to be the main language of communication in many areas of the central Pyrenees, and [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Navarro-Aragonese]], took over instead. The colonizers of the lands conquered to the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian kingdoms]] brought the new language along, and not Basque.\n\nThe [[kingdom of Navarre]] was restored in 1157 under [[Garc\u00eda VI of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]] ''the Restorer'', who fought Castile for control over its western lands of the realm (La Rioja, [[\u00c1lava]], and parts of Old Castile; see map). In the mid-12th century, Navarrese kings [[Sancho the Wise]] and his successor [[Sancho VII of Navarre|Sancho VII]] asserted Navarrese authority over central \u00c1lava in their contest with Castile by granting various [[Municipal charter|town charters]], i.e. [[County of Trevi\u00f1o|Trevi\u00f1o]] (1161), [[Laguardia, \u00c1lava|Laguardia]] (1164), [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (1181), [[Bernedo]], Anto\u00f1ana (1182), La Puebla de Arganz\u00f3n (1191).{{Sfnp|Portilla|1991|p=12}} A peace treaty signed in 1179 ceded La Rioja and the northeastern part of present-day [[Old Castile]] to the Castilian crown. In return, this pact acknowledged that central \u00c1lava, [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]] belonged to Navarre.\n\nIn 1199, while Navarre's King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI ''the Wise'']] was away on a diplomatic mission in [[Tlemcen]], Castile invaded and annexed the western Basque Country, leaving Navarre landlocked. King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] promised to give the [[Durangaldea]], Gipuzkoa and \u00c1lava back, but ultimately that did not happen. However, the Castilian king went on to ratify their [[fueros of Navarre|Navarrese rights]] and garner their loyalty. They managed to retain a large degree of their self-government and [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|native laws]], which all Castilian (and later, Spanish) monarchs, or their viceroys, would swear to uphold on oath until the 19th century. During the following decades, Castilian kings reinforced their position over Navarre's borders and secured new commercial routes, notably the [[San Adrian (tunnel)|Tunnel Route]], by chartering new towns, e.g. Trevi\u00f1o (1254, rechartered), [[Agurain]], [[Campezo/Kanpezu]], Corres, [[Contrasta]], [[Segura]], [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]], [[Ordu\u00f1a]] (rechartered), [[Mondragon, Spain|Mondragon]] (Arrasate; 1260, rechartered), [[Bergara]] (1268, rechartered), [[Ordizia|Villafranca]] (1268), [[Artziniega]] (1272), etc.{{Sfnp|Portilla|1991|p=13}}\n\n===Basque sailors===\n{{See also|History of Basque whaling}}\n[[Image:Basques Newfoundland.gif|250px|thumb|Basque fishing sites in Canada in the 16th and 17th centuries]]\n[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 133-134.jpg|250px|thumb|Basque warriors in military outfit (1530s)]]\n\nBasques played an important role in early European ventures into the Atlantic Ocean. The earliest document to mention the use of whale oil or blubber by the Basques dates from 670. In 1059, whalers from [[Lapurdi]] are recorded to have presented the oil of the first whale they captured to the viscount. Apparently the Basques were averse to the taste of [[whale meat]] themselves, but did successful business selling it and the blubber to the [[French people|French]], Castilians and [[Flanders|Flemings]].\n\nOn the heat of the 1199\u20131201 Castilian conquests (Gipuzkoa, shire of Durango, \u00c1lava), a number of towns were founded all along the coast during the next two hundred years. The towns chartered by the Castilian kings, thrived on fishing and maritime trade (with northern Europe), as depicted in their coat of arms. The development of ironworks (water propelled) and shipyards added to the Basque naval effort. Basque whalers used longboats or ''traineras'' which they rowed in the vicinity of the coast or from a larger ship.\n\nWhaling and [[cod]]-fishing are probably responsible for early Basque contact with both the North Sea and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The Basques began cod-fishing and later whaling in Labrador and Newfoundland as early as the first half of the 16th century.\n\nIn Europe, the rudder seems to have been a Basque invention, to judge from three masted ships depicted in a 12th-century fresco in [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] (Navarre; ''Lizarra'' in Basque), and also seals preserved in Navarrese and Parisian historical archives which show similar vessels. The first mention of use of a rudder was referred to as steering \"\u00e0 la Navarraise\" or \"\u00e0 la Bayonnaise\".{{Sfnp|Urzainqui/Olaizola|1998|p=?}}\n\nMagellan's expedition was manned on departure by 200 sailors, at least 35 of them Basques, and when Magellan was killed in the Philippines, his Basque second-in-command, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] took the ship all the way back to Spain. 18 crew members completed the circumnavigation, 4 of them Basques. The Basques mutinied in [[Christopher Columbus]]' expedition, a distinctive group who is reported to have erected a makeshift camp in an American island.\n\nEarly 17th century international treaties seriously undermined Basque whaling across the northern Atlantic. In 1615, Gipuzkoan whalers frequenting Iceland for decades [[Sp\u00e1nverjav\u00edgin|were massacred]] (32) by an Icelandic force commanded by the sheriff Ari Magnusson acting on orders of the Danish king. The act ordering the killing of Basques was finally revoked in 2015 during a Basque-Icelandic friendship event.<ref>{{cite news |last=Perez Zala |first=Ander |date=2015-07-17|title=Una jornada evoca la masacre de balleneros vascos en Islandia |url=http://www.naiz.eus/en/actualidad/noticia/20150717/400-aniversario-del-baskavigin-la-masacre-de-los-balleneros-vascos |newspaper=Naiz|location=Donostia|access-date=2015-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/04/27/killing-basques-now-banned-west-fjords |title=Killing of Basques now banned on West Fjords|last1=Svala Arnarsd\u00f3ttir|first1=Eygl\u00f3|last2= |first2= |date=2015-04-27|website=Iceland Review|publisher=|access-date=2015-07-22|quote=}}</ref> However, northern Atlantic fishing continued at least up to the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), when the Spanish Basques were definitely deprived of their traditional northern European fishing grounds.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nThe Basque Country in the [[Late Middle Ages]] was ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In Navarre these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the [[Agramont]] and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, the two major warring factions were named O\u00f1az and Gamboa (cf. the [[Guelphs]] and [[Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures called ''dorretxeak'' (\"tower houses\") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fire, sometimes by royal decree.\n\n==Modern period==\n{{Further|Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros{{!}}Basque and Pyrenean fueros}}\n\n===Self-government status and accommodation===\n\n====Navarre divided and home rule====\n\n[[File:Henri d'Albret (1503\u20131555), King of Navarre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry II of Navarre|King Henry II]] called the Parliament of Navarre in [[Saint-Palais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], with a requirement for all its members to have a command in Basque (1523)]]\n\nBasques in the present-day Spanish and French districts of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] managed to retain a large degree of self-government within their respective districts, practically functioning initially as separate nation-states. The western Basques managed to confirm their home rule at the end of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]'s civil wars, pledging an oath to claimant [[Isabella I of Castile]] in exchange for generous terms in overseas trade. Their ''fueros'' recognised separate laws, taxation and courts in each district.\nAs the [[Middle Ages]] drew to a close, the Basques got sandwiched between two rising superpowers after the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre]], i.e. France and Spain. Most of the Basque population ended up in Spain, or \"the Spains\", according to its poly-centric arrangement prevailing under the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburgs]]. The initial repression in Navarre on the local nobility and population (1513, 1516, 1523) was followed by a softer, compromising policy on the part of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. While heavily conditioned by its geopolitical situation, the [[Kingdom of Navarre#Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees|Kingdom of Navarre-Bearn]] remained independent and attempts at reunification, both in Iberian and continental Navarre, did not cease up to 1610&mdash;[[Henry III of Navarre|King Henry of Navarre and France]] was set to march over Navarre at the moment of his assassination.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] made some inroads and was supported by Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]] of [[Lower Navarre|Navarre]]-[[Viscounty of Bearn|Bearn]]. The printing of books in Basque, mostly on Christian themes, was introduced in the late 16th century by the Basque-speaking [[bourgeois]]ie around [[Bayonne, France|Bayonne]] in the northern Basque Country. King [[Henry III of Navarre]], a Protestant, converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become King [[Henry IV of France]] too (\"Paris is well worth a mass\"). However, [[Protestant Reformation|Reformist]] ideas, imported via the vibrant [[Way of Saint James|Ways of Saint James]] and sustained by the Kingdom of Navarre-Bearn, were subject to intense persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and other institutions as early as 1521, especially in bordering areas, a matter with close links to the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|shaky status of Navarre]].\n[[File:Figure Blason Pecheurs Basques.svg|thumb|left|On the whale hunt, as depicted on the coat of arms of [[Biarritz]]]]\n\nThe Parliament of Navarre in Pamplona (''The Three States, Cortes'') kept denouncing King [[Philip II of Spain]]'s breach of the binding terms laid out in his oath taking ceremony&mdash;tension came to a head in 1592 with an imposed oath pledging for [[Philip III of Spain]] fraught with irregularities&mdash;while in 1600 allegations arise of discrimination by Castilian abbots and bishops to the Navarrese monks \"for the sake of their nation\", as pointed by the Kingdom's Government (the ''Diputaci\u00f3n'').{{Sfnp|Urzainqui/Esarte/Et al.|2013|p=30}} A combination of factors&mdash;suspicion of the Basques, intolerance to a different language, religious practices, traditions, high status held by women in the area (cf. whaling campaigns), along with political intrigues involving the lords of Urtubie in [[Urrugne|Urru\u00f1a]] and the critical [[Urdazubi/Urdax|Urdazubi]] abbey&mdash;led to the [[Basque witch trials]] in 1609.\n[[File:Fourneau 2.JPG|thumb|A furnace to melt whale grease left by the Basques in [[\u00cele aux Basques]] off Canada's coast]]\nIn 1620 the ''de jure'' separate [[Lower Navarre]] was absorbed by the Kingdom of France, and in 1659 the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] upheld actual Spanish and French territorial control and determined the fate of vague bordering areas, so establishing customs that did not exist up to that point and restricting free cross-border access. The measures decided were implemented as of 1680.\n\nThe region specific laws also underwent a gradual erosion and devaluation, more so in the [[French Basque Country]] than in the [[Southern Basque Country|southern districts]]. In 1660 the authority of the Assembly of [[Labourd]] (''Biltzar'' of Ustaritz) was significantly curtailed. In 1661 French centralization and the nobility's ambition to take over and privatize commons unleashed a popular rebellion in [[Soule]]&mdash;led by Bernard Goihenetche \"Matalaz\"&mdash;ultimately quelled in blood.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=267}} However, Labourd and its ''Biltzar'' retained important attributions and autonomy, showing [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carte_des_Traites_1732.png an independent fiscal system].\n\n====Masters of the ocean====\n[[File:Mirandaola_burdinola_0002.png|thumb|Blacksmiths dressed up in period attire at an ironwork re-enactment in [[Legazpi, Spain|Legazpi]]]]\n[[File:Vernet-port-Bayonne.jpg|thumb|Harbour of Bayonne in 1755, at the height of trade within the [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]]]]\n\nThe Basques (or ''Biscaynes''), especially proper Biscayans [[Gipuzkoa]]ns and [[Lapurdi]]ans, thrived on whale hunting, shipbuilding, iron exportation to England, and trade with northern Europe and America during the 16th century, at which time the Basques became the masters not only of whaling but the Atlantic Ocean. However, King [[Philip II of Spain]]'s failed ''[[Armada Invencible]]'' endeavour in 1588,  largely relying on heavy whaling and trade galleons confiscated to the reluctant Basques, proved disastrous. The Spanish defeat triggered the immediate collapse of Basque supremacy over the oceans and the rise of English hegemony.{{Sfnp|Collins|1987}} As whaling declined privateering soared.\n\nMany Basques found in the Castilian-Spanish Empire an opportunity to promote their social position and venture to America to make a living and sometimes amass a little fortune that spurred the foundation of the present-day [[baserri]]s. Basques serving under the Spanish flag became renowned sailors, and many of them were among the first Europeans to reach America. For example, [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first expedition to the ''New World'' was partially manned by Basques, the Santa Maria vessel was made in Basque shipyards, and the owner, [[Juan de la Cosa]], may have been a Basque.{{Sfnp|Campbell|1987}}\n\nOther seamen became renowned as [[privateer]]s for the French and Spanish kings alike, namely Joanes Suhigaraitxipi from Bayonne (17th century) and [[\u00c9tienne Pellot]] ([[Hendaye]]), \"the last privateer\" (early 19th century). By the end of the 16th century, Basques were conspicuously present in America, notably Chile, or [[Potos\u00ed]]. In the latter, we hear that they went on to cluster around a national confederacy [[War of the Vicu\u00f1as and Basques|engaging in war against another one]], the ''Vicu\u00f1as'', formed by a melting pot of Spanish colonists and Native Americans (1620-1625).{{Sfnp|Campbell|1987}}\n\n====A Basque trade area====\n[[File:1712 Basque districts.png|thumb|French map of the Basque districts (mid-18th century)]]\nThe Basques initially welcomed Philip V&mdash;from the lineage of King [[Henry III of Navarre]]&mdash;to the Crown of Castile (1700), but the absolutist outlook inherited from [[Louis XIV|his grandfather]] could hardly withstand the test of the Basque contractual system. The 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (see [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque sailors]] above) and the [[Nueva Planta decrees|1714 suppression of home rule]] in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]] disquieted the Basques. It did not take long until the Spanish king, relying on prime minister [[Giulio Alberoni]], attempted to enlarge his tax revenue and foster a Spanish internal market by meddling in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque low-tax trade area]] and moving Basque customs from the [[Ebro river|Ebro]] to the coast and the Pyrenees. With their overseas and customary cross-Pyrenean trade&mdash;and by extension home rule&mdash;under threat, the royal advance was responded by the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|western Basques]] with a trail of ''matxinadas'', or uprisings, that shook 30 towns in coastal areas (Biscay, Gipuzkoa).{{Sfnp|Kamen|2001|p=125}} Spanish troops were sent over, and the widespread rebellion quelled in blood.<ref>[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/65117/35671 Matxinada de 1718 (Au\u00f1amendi Entziklopedia)]</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the events, an expedition led by the [[Duke of Berwick]] dispatched by the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] broke into Spanish territory by the western Pyrenees (April 1719) only to find Gipuzkoans, Biscayans and \u00c1lavans making a formal, conditional recognition of French rule (August 1719).{{Sfnp|Kamen|2001|p=125}} Confronted with a collapsing Basque loyalty, King Philip V backed down on his designs in favour of bringing customs back to the Ebro (1719). A pardon to the leaders of the rebellion in 1726 paved the way to an understanding of the [[Juntas Generales|Basque regional governments]] with Madrid officials, and the ensuing foundation of the [[Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] in 1728. The Basque districts in Spain kept operating virtually as independent republics.{{Sfnp|Kamen|2001|p=121}}\n\nThe Guipuzcoan Company greatly added to the prosperity of the Basque districts, by exporting iron commodities and importing products such as cacao, tobacco, and hides.{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|p=88}} Merchandise imported on to the Spanish heartland in turn would incur no duties in its customs.{{Sfnp|Douglass|2005|p=90}} The vibrant trade that followed added to a flourishing building activity and the establishment of the pivotal [[Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country|Royal Basque Society]], led by [[Xavier Maria de Munibe e Idiaquez|Xavier Maria de Munibe]], for the encouragement of science and arts.\n\nEmigration to America did not stop, with Basques&mdash;reputed for their close solidarity bonds, high organizational skills and an industrious disposition&mdash;found venturing into Upper [[The Californias|California]] at the head of the early expeditions and governor positions, e.g. [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]], [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], [[Diego de Borica]], [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arrillaga|J.J. de Arrillaga]], etc. At home, the need for technical innovations&mdash;not encouraged any longer by the Spanish Crown during the last third of the 18th century&mdash;the virtual exhaustion of the forests supplying the ironworks, and the decline of the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas after the end of its trade monopoly with America heralded a major economic and political crisis.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the Basques were deprived of their customary trade with America and choked by the Spanish disproportionately high customs duties in the Ebro river, but at least enjoyed a fluent internal market and intensive trade with France. [[Kingdom of Navarre#The crown and the kingdom. A constitutional foundation|Navarre]]'s geographic distribution of trade in late 18th century is estimated at 37.2% with France (unspecified), 62.3% with other Basque districts, and only 0.5% with the Spanish heartland.{{Sfnp|Esparza|2012|p=57}} On a positive note the Spanish customs exactions imposed over the Ebro favoured a more European orientation and the circulation of innovative ideas&mdash;labelled by many in Spain as \"un-Spanish\"&mdash;both technical and humanistic, such as Rousseau's '[[social contract]]', hailed especially by the Basque liberals, who widely supported home rule (''fueros''). Cross-Pyrenean contacts among Basque scholars and public personalities also intensified, increasing awareness of a common identity beyond district specific practices.\n\n===Under the nation-states===\n\n====Revolution and war====\n{{Further|End of Basque home rule in France}}\n[[File:Rio Ebro, heart of La Rioja.jpg|thumb|Ebro river winding down La Rioja of [[\u00c1lava]] and on into the Ribera of Navarre, both fertile grounds for vineyards and cereal crops]]\n[[File:Battle of Nivelle - November 10th 1813 - Fonds Ancely - B315556101 A HEATH 029.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Nivelle]], follow-up to Donostia's destruction (1813)]]\n\nSelf-government in the northern Basque Country came to an abrupt end when the [[French Revolution]] centralized government and abolished the [[Fueros#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|region specific powers]] recognized by the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]''.

It has been argued that despite its 'fraternal' intent, the intervention of the French Revolution actually destroyed a highly participatory political culture, based on the provincial assemblies (the democratic ''Biltzar'', and the other Estates).{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|pp=58}}\n\nThe [[Southern Basque Country]] was mired in constant disputes with the royal Spanish authority&mdash;breach of ''fueros''&mdash;and talks came to a deadlock on accession of [[Manuel Godoy]] to office. The central government started to enforce its decisions single-handedly, e.g. regional quotas in military mobilization, so the different Basque autonomous governments&mdash;Navarre, Gipuzkoa, Biscay, \u00c1lava&mdash;felt definitely disenfranchised. During the [[War of the Pyrenees#Western Pyrenees|War of the Pyrenees]] and the [[Peninsular War]], the impending threat to the self-government on the part of the Spanish royal authority was critical for war events and alliances&mdash;cf.

Ironically they and Ferdinand VII ended up implementing the centralizing agenda of the Spanish liberals, but without any of its benefits.\n\n====First Carlist War and the end of the ''fueros''====\n{{Further|End of Basque home rule (Spain)}}\n[[File:Museo Zumalakarregi Albumsigloxix 000553.JPG|thumb|Embrace of Bergara, the final act of the First Carlist War (1839)]]\n[[File:Museo Zumalakarregi Albumsigloxix 002431.JPG|thumb|Railway bridge engineered by Eiffel's company over Ormaiztegi, home town of [[Tomas de Zumalacarregui]]]]\n[[Image:Mapa pol\u00edtico de Espa\u00f1a, 1850.jpg|thumb|right|Political Spain in 1854, after the [[First Carlist War]]]]\n[[File:Gernikako Arbola.

The opposing Isabeline Army had the vital support of British, French (notably the [[Algeria]]n legion) and Portuguese forces, and the backing of these governments. The Irish legion (''[[Tercio]]'') was virtually annihilated by the Basques in the [[Battle of Oriamendi]].\n\nHowever, the Carlist ideology was not in itself prone to stand up for the Basque specific institutions, traditions, and identity, but royal absolutism and Church,{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=275}} thriving in rural based environments and totally opposed to modern liberal ideas. They presented themselves as true Spaniards, and contributed to the Spanish centralizing drive. Despite the circumstances and their Catholicism, many Basques came to think that staunch conservatism was not leading them anywhere.\n\nAfter Tomas Zumalacarregui's early and unexpected death during the Siege of Bilbao in 1835 and further military successes up to 1837, the [[First Carlist War]] started to turn against the Carlists, which in turn widened the gap between the Apostolic (official) and the Basque pro-fueros parties within the Carlist camp. Echoing a widespread malaise, J.A. Mu\u00f1agorri took the lead of a faction advocating a split with claimant to the throne [[Carlos Mar\u00eda Isidro de Borb\u00f3n|Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]] under the banner \"Peace and Fueros\" (cf. ''[[Mu\u00f1agorriren bertsoak]]''). The dissatisfaction crystallized in the [[Convention of Vergara|1839 Embrace of Bergara]] and the subsequent [[s:es:Decreto de Confirmaci\u00f3n de Fueros|Act for the Confirmation of the Fueros]]. It included a promise by the Spaniards to respect a reduced version of the previous Basque self-government. The pro-''fueros'' liberals strong at the moment in war and poverty stricken Pamplona confirmed most of the above arrangements, but signed the separate 1841 \"Compromise Act\" (''Ley Paccionada''), whereby Navarre ceased officially to exist as a kingdom and was made into a Spanish province, but keeping a set of important prerogatives, including control over taxation.\n\nCustoms were then definitely moved from the [[Ebro river]] over to the coast and the Pyrenees, which destroyed the formerly lucrative Bayonne-Pamplona trade and much of the region's prosperity.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|pp=149\u2013150}} The dismantling of the native political system had severe consequences throughout the Basque Country, leaving many families struggling to survive after the enforcement of the French Civil Code in the continental Basque region. The French legal arrangement deprived many families of their customary common lands and had their family property divided.<ref>Watson (2003), p. 149</ref>\n\nThe new political design triggered also cross-border smuggling, and French [[Basque American|Basques emigrated to the USA]] and other American destinations in large numbers. They account for about half of the total emigration from France during the 19th century, estimated at 50.000 to 100.000 inhabitants.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=151}} The same fate&mdash;North and South America altogether&mdash;was followed by many other Basques, who during the following decades set out from Basque and other neighbouring ports (Santander, Bordeaux) in search for a better life, e.g. the bard Jose Maria Iparragirre, composer of the ''[[Gernikako Arbola]]'', widely held as the Basque national anthem. In 1844, the [[Guardia Civil|Civil Guard]], a paramilitary police force (cited in Iparragirre's popular song ''Zibilak esan naute''), was established with a view to defend and spread the idea of a Spanish central state, particularly in rural areas, while the 1856 education reform consciously promoted the use of the Castilian (Spanish) language.{{Sfnp|Watson|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe economic scene in the [[French Basque Country]], badly affected by war developments up to 1814 and intermittently cut off since 1793 from its customary trade flow with fellow Basque districts to the south, was languid and marked by small scale exploitation of natural resources in the rural milieu, e.g. mining, salt extraction, farming and wool processing, flour mills, etc. Bayonne remained the main trade hub, while Biarritz thrived as a seaside tourist resort for the elites ([[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress Eugenie]]'s venue in 1854). During this period, [[\u00c1lava]] and Navarre showed little economic dynamism, remaining largely attached to rural activity with a small middle-class based in the capital cities&mdash;[[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] and [[Pamplona]].\n\nThe centuries long [[forge]] (ironwork) network linked to readily available timber, abundant waterways, and proximity of coastal harbours saw its final agony, but some kept operating&mdash;north of Navarre, Gipuzkoa, [[Biscay]]. A critical moment for the development of heavy metal industry came with the introduction in 1855 of [[Bessemer process|Bessemer blast furnaces]] for the mass-production of steel in the [[Bilbao]] area. In 1863 the [[Juntas Generales|Regional Council of Biscay]] liberalized the exportation of iron ore, and in the same year the first mining railway line was pressed into operation. A rapid development followed, encouraged by a dynamic local bourgeoisie, coastal location, availability of technical know-how, an inflow of foreign steel industry investors&mdash;partnering with a local family owned group ''Ybarra y C\u00eda''&mdash;as well as Spanish and foreign high demand for iron ore. The transfer of the Spanish customs border from the southern boundary of the Basque Country to the Spanish-French border ultimately encouraged the inclusion of Spain's Basque districts in a new Spanish market, the protectionism of which favoured in that respect the birth and growth of Basque industry.\n\nThe ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Norte'' railway company, a [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier|Credit Mobilier]] franchise,{{Sfnp|L\u00f3pez-Morell|1990|pp=155-156}} arrived at the bordering town of [[Irun]] in 1865, while the French railway cut its way along the Basque coast all the way to [[Hendaye]] in 1864 ([[Bayonne]] in 1854). The arrival of the railway was to have a deep social, economic and cultural impact, sparking both admiration and opposition. With the expansion of the railway network, industry also developed in [[Gipuzkoa]] following a different pattern&mdash;slower, distributed across different valleys, and centred on metallic manufacturing and processing, thanks to local expertise and entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the run-up to the [[Third Carlist War|Third (Second) Carlist War]] (1872-1876), the implementation of the treaties concluding the First Carlist War was faced with tensions arising from the Spanish Government's attempt to alter by ''faits accomplis'' the spirit and print of the agreements in respect of finances and taxation, the crowning jewels of the Southern Basque Country's separate status along with the specificity of the military draft. Following the instability of the I Spanish Republic (1868) and the struggle for dynastic succession in Madrid, by 1873 the Carlists made themselves strong in Navarre and expanded their territorial grip all over the [[Southern Basque Country]] except for the capital cities, establishing ''de facto'' a Basque state with a seat in [[Estella-Lizarra]], where claimant to the throne [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]] had settled. The ruling Carlist government included not only judiciary arrangements for military matters but the establishment of civil tribunals, as well as its own currency and stamps.\n\nHowever, the [[Carlism|Carlists]] failed to capture the four capitals in the territory, bringing about attrition and the gradual collapse of Carlist military strength starting in summer 1875. Other theatres of war in Spain (Castile, Catalonia) were no exception, with the Carlists undergoing a wide number of setbacks that contributed to the eventual victory of King [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]]'s Spanish army. Its columns advanced and took over Irun and [[Estella-Lizarra]] by February 1876. This time the rising Spanish Prime Minister [[Canovas del Castillo]] stated that no agreement bound him, and went on to decree the \"Act for the Abolition of the Basque Charters\", with its 1st article proclaiming the \"duties the political Constitution has always imposed on all the Spanish.\" The Basque districts in Spain including Navarre lost their sovereignty and were assimilated to the Spanish provinces, still preserving a small set of prerogatives (the [[Basque Economic Agreement]]s, and the 1841 Compromise Act for Navarre).\n\n==Late Modern history==\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[Image:NafarForuak.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial erected in [[Pamplona]] to the traditional [[Fueros of Navarre|Laws of Navarre]] (1903): \"We, the Basques of today, in memory of our eternal ancestors, have gathered here to show our determination to keep Our Laws\"]]\n[[File:Chateau d Abbadie.jpg|thumb|Antoine d'Abbadie's castle in [[Hendaye]]]]\n\nThe loss of the Charters in 1876 spawned political dissent and unrest, with two traditionalist movements arising to counter the Spanish centralist and comparatively liberal stance, the Carlists and the Basque nationalists. The former emphasized staunchly catholic and absolutist values, while the latter stressed Catholicism and the charters mingled with a Basque national awareness (Jaungoikoa eta Lege Zarra). Besides showing at the beginning slightly different positions, the Basque nationalists took hold in the industrialised Biscay and to a lesser extent Gipuzkoa, while the Carlist entrenched themselves especially in the rural Navarre and to a lesser extent in \u00c1lava.\n\nWith regards to the economic activity, high quality iron ore mainly from western Biscay, processed up to the early 19th century in small traditional ironworks around the western Basque Country, was now exported to Britain for industrial processing (see section above). Between 1878 and 1900 58 million tons of ore were exported from the Basque Country to Great Britain. The profits gained in this exportation was in turn reinvested by local entrepreneurs in iron and steel industry, a move spurring an \"industrial revolution\" that was to spread from Bilbao and the Basque Country across Spain, despite the economic incompetence shown by the Spanish central government.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=273}}\n\nFollowing up economic developments started in mid-19th century and given the momentum of the Spanish internal market after the end of the ''fueros'', Biscay developed its own modern [[blast furnaces]] and heavier mining, while industrialization took off in Gipuzkoa. The large numbers of workers which both required were initially drawn from the Basque countryside and the peasantry of nearby Castile and Rioja, but increasingly immigration began to flow from the remoter impoverished regions of Galicia and Andalusia. The Basque Country, hitherto a source of emigrants to France, Spain and America, faced for the first time in recent history the prospect of a massive influx of foreigners possessing different languages and cultures as a side-effect of industrialisation. Most of these immigrants spoke Spanish; practically all were very poor.\n\nThe French railway arrived at Hendaye (Hendaia) in 1864, so connecting Madrid and Paris. The railway provision for the Basque coast entailed not only a more fluent freight shipping, but a quicker expansion of the seaside spa model of [[Biarritz]] to [[Donostia]], providing a steady flow of tourists, elitist first and middle class later&mdash;especially from Madrid. Not only that, a regular immigration of administration and customs officials from the French and Spanish heartlands ensued, ignorant of local culture and often reluctant, even hostile to Basque language. However, meanwhile, prominent figures concerned with the decay of Basque culture started to promote initiatives aimed at enhancing its status and development, e.g. the renowned [[Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie|Antoine d'Abbadie]], a major driving force behind the ''Lore Jokoak'' literary and cultural festivals, with the liberal Donostia also becoming a vibrant hotspot for Basque culture, featuring figures such as [[Serafin Baroja]], poet-[[bertsolari|troubadour]] [[Bilintx]], or play-writer Ramon Maria Labaien.\n\nIn this period, Biscay reached one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. While the new proletariat's wretched working and living conditions were providing a natural breeding ground for the new socialist and anarchist ideologies and political movements characteristic of the late 19th century, the end of the 19th century also saw the birth of the above [[Basque nationalism]]. The Spanish government's failure to comply with the provisions established at the end of the [[Third Carlist War]] (1876) and before (the 1841 ''Compromise Act'' in Navarre) raised a public outcry, crystallizing in the ''Gamazada'' popular uprising in Navarre (1893-1894) that provided a springboard for the incipient Basque nationalism<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/60321 |title=La Gamazada |author=Idoia Estornes Zubizarreta |date= |website=Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia|publisher= EuskoMedia Fundazioa|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>&mdash;[[EAJ-PNV|Basque Nationalist Party]] founded in 1895.\n\nThe PNV, pursuing the goal of independence or self-government for a Basque state (''Euzkadi''), represented an ideology which combined [[Christian Democracy|Christian-Democratic]] ideas with abhorrence towards Spanish immigrants whom they perceived as a threat to the ethnic, cultural and linguistic integrity of the Basque race while also serving as a channel for the importation of new-fangled, leftist (and \"un-Basque\") ideas.\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIndustrialisation across the Atlantic basin Basque districts (Biscay, Gipuzkoa, north-western \u00c1lava) was further boosted by the outbreak of World War I in Europe. Spain remained neutral in the war conflict, with Basque steel production and export further expanding thanks to the demand of the European war effort.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=273}} Ironically, the end of the European war in 1918 brought about the decline and transformation of the Basque industry. In the French Basque Country, its inhabitants were drafted to add to the French war effort. War took a heavy toll on the Basques, 6,000 died. It also significantly spurred the penetration of French nationalist ideas into Basque territory, limited to certain circles and contexts up to that point.\n\nIn 1931, at the outset of the Spanish 2nd Republic, echoing the recently granted self-government to [[Catalonia]], an attempt was made to draw up [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Estatuto_General_del_Estado_Vasco_aprobado_en_la_Magna_Asamblea_de_Municipios_Vascos_celebrada_en_Estella_(Lizarra)_el_d%C3%ADa_14_de_Junio_de_1931 a single statute] for the Basque territories in Spain ([[Southern Basque Country|''Provincias Vascongadas'' and ''Navarra'']]), but after an initial overwhelming approval of the draft and a round of council mayor meetings, [[Navarre]] [http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c22f3/index.php pulled out of the draft project] amidst heated controversy over the validity of the votes (Pamplona, 1932). Tellingly, the [[Carlism|Carlist]] council of Pamplona claimed that \"it is unacceptable to call [the territory included in the draft Statute] ''Pa\u00eds Vasco-Navarro'' in Spanish. It is fine ''Vasconia'', and ''Euskalerr\u00eda'', but not ''Euzkadi''\".{{Sfnp|Esparza|2012|p=20}}\n\nUndaunted, the [[Basque nationalist]]s and [[left-wing politics|leftist]] republican forces kept working on a statute, this time only for the Basque western provinces, \u00c1lava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, eventually approved in 1936, with the [[Spanish Civil War]] already raging and an effective control just over Biscay.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"135px\" heights=\"135px\">\nFile:Pasaiako San Roke.jpg|Launch of a boat at a shipyard in [[Pasaia]], Gipuzkoa (1920)\nFile:Jose Antonio Agirre Lekube speech in Basque Nationalism Meeting, 1933.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre (politician)|J.A.

(The latter were known in Spain as \"Nacionales\"&mdash;usually rendered in English as \"Nationalists\"&mdash;which can be highly misleading in the Basque context). However, Navarre especially was not spared. As soon as the rebels led by [[General Mola]] made themselves strong in the district, they initiated a terror campaign against blacklisted individuals aimed at purging the rearguard and break any glimmer of dissent. The confirmed death toll rose to 2,857, plus a further 305 in prison (malnutrition, ill-treatment, etc.);{{Sfnp|Preston|1990|pp=179-183}} victims and historic memory associations raise the figure to near 4,000.\n\nAnother big atrocity of this war, immortalised by Picasso's emblematic mural, was the [[Bombing of Guernica|bombing of Gernika]] by [[Legion Condor|German planes]], a [[Biscay]]ne town of great historical and symbolic importance, at Franco's bidding. In 1937, the [[Eusko Gudarostea]], the troops of the new government of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] surrendered to Franco's fascist [[Corpo Truppe Volontari|Italian allies]] in [[Santo\u00f1a]] on condition that the lives of the Basque soldiers were respected ([[Santo\u00f1a Agreement]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiru.com/historia/historia_07925.html |title=La Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola en Euskal Herria |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= Hiru |publisher= Basque Government's Department of Education, Language Policy and Culture|access-date=2015-11-15|quote=}}</ref> [[War in the North|Basques (Gipuzkoa, Biscay)]] fled for their lives to exile by the tens of thousands, including a [[Evacuation of children in the Spanish Civil War|mass evacuation of children]] aboard chartered boats (the ''ni\u00f1os de la guerra'') into permanent exile.\n\nWith the Spanish Civil War over, the new dictator began his drive to turn Spain into a totalitarian [[nation state]]. Franco's regime passed harsh laws against all minorities in the Spanish state, including Basques, aimed at wiping out their cultures and languages. Calling Biscay and Gipuzkoa \"traitor provinces\", he abolished what remained of their autonomy. Navarre and \u00c1lava were allowed to hang onto a [[miqueletes|small local police force]] and limited tax prerogatives.\n\nAfter 1937, the Basque territories remained behind the war lines, but the French Basque Country became a forced destination for fellow Basques from Spain fleeing war, only to find themselves confined in prisoner camps, such as [[Gurs internment camp|Gurs]] on the outer fringes of [[Soule]] ([[Basses Pyrenees]]). The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] established a [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German military occupation]] of the French Atlantic, including the French Basque Country up to [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], with the rest of it being falling on the [[Vichy France]]. The whole western and central Pyrenees became a hotspot for clandestine operations and organized resistance, e.g. [[Comet line]].\n\n===Franco's dictatorship===\nTwo developments during the Franco dictatorship (1939\u20131975) deeply affected life in the Basque Country in this period and afterward. One was a new wave of immigration from the poorer parts of Spain to Biscay and Gipuzkoa during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in response to the region's escalating industrialization aimed to supply the Spanish internal market as a result of a post-war self-sufficiency policy, favoured by the regime.\n\nSecondly, the regime's persecution provoked a strong backlash in the Basque Country from the 1960s onwards, notably in the form of a new political movement, [[ETA (separatist group)|Basque Country And Freedom]] (''Euskadi Ta Askatasuna''), better known by its Basque initials [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], who turned to the systematic use of arms as a form of protest in 1968. But ETA was only one component of a social, political and language movement rejecting Spanish domination but also sharply criticizing the inertia of the Basque Country's own conservative nationalists (organized in the PNV). To this day the dialectic between these two political trends, the ''Abertzale'' (patriotic or nationalist) Left and the PNV, dominate the nationalist part of the Basque political spectrum, the rest of which is occupied by non-nationalist parties.\n\n==Present==\n{{See also|Basque conflict}}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n|+ '''1978 SPANISH CONSTITUTION REFERENDUM'''\n|- style=\"background: #efefef;\"|\n!\n!

Two new stances arose in Basque politics, namely break or compromise. While ETA's different branches decided to keep confrontation to gain a new status for the Basque Country, PNV and the Spanish Communists and Socialists opted for negotiations with the Francoist regime. In 1978, a general pardon was decreed by the Spanish Government for all politics related offences, a decision affecting directly Basque nationalist activists, especially ETA militants. In the same year, the referendum to ratify the Spanish Constitution was held. The electoral platforms closer to ETA's two branches ([[Herri Batasuna]], [[Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia|EIA]]) advocated for a \"No\" option, while PNV called for abstention on the grounds that it had no Basque input. The results in the [[Southern Basque Country]] showed a conspicuous gap with other regions in Spain, especially in the Basque Autonomous Community.\n\nIn the 1970s and early/mid-1980s, the Basque Country was gripped by intense violence practised by Basque nationalist and state-sponsored illegal groups and police forces. Between 1979 and 1983, in the framework of the new Spanish Constitution, the central government granted wide self-governing powers (\"[[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country|autonomy]]\") to [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|\u00c1lava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa]] after a referendum on a Basque statute, including its own elected parliament, [[Ertzaintza|police force]], [[Basque education system|school system]], and control over taxation, while [[Navarre]] was left out of the new autonomous region after the Socialists backed down on their initial position, and it was made into a separate autonomous region. Thereafter, despite the difficulties facing, with overt long-time institutional and academic hostility in the French Basque Country<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/17/france |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Local language recognition angers French academy |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> and Navarre, Basque language education has grown to become a key actor in formal education at all levels.\n\nThe political events were accompanied by a collapse in the manufacturing industry in the Southern Basque Country following the 1973 and 1979 crises. The marked decay of the 1970s put an end to the ''baby boom'' and halted the internal Spanish immigration trend started in the postwar years. The crisis left the newly established Basque autonomous government from [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (led initially by [[Carlos Garaikoetxea]]) facing a major strategic challenge related to the dismantling of the traditional shipbuilding and steel industry now subject to open international competition. Economic confidence was largely restored during the mid-1990s when the autonomous government's bet on modernization of manufacturing, R+D based specialization, and quality tourism started to bear fruit, counting on flowing credit from local savings banks. Cross-border synergies between the French and Spanish side of the Basque Country have confirmed the territory as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nThe 1979 Statute of Autonomy is an organic law of mandatory implementation, but powers have been devolved gradually over decades as a result of re-negotiations between the Spanish and successive Basque regional governments according to after-electoral needs, while the transfer of many powers is still due. In January 2017, the first common administrative institution ever was established in the [[French Basque Country]], the [[Basque Municipal Community]] presided over by the mayor of [[Bayonne]] [[Jean-Ren\u00e9 Etchegaray]] and considered a 'historic' event by the representatives.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2017-01-02|title=Abian da Euskal Elkargoa [The Basque Community kicks off]|url=http://www.eitb.eus/eu/albisteak/politika/osoa/4571445/abian-da-euskal-elkargoa-ipar-euskal-herrian/|newspaper=EITB |location= |access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sabathl\u00e9 |first=Pierre|date=2017-01-23|title=Jean-Ren\u00e9 Etchegaray \u00e9lu pr\u00e9sident de la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019agglom\u00e9ration Pays basque|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2017/01/23/jean-rene-etchegaray-elu-president-de-la-communaute-d-agglomeration-pays-basque-3131534-4018.php|newspaper=SudOuest|location= |access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"135px\" heights=\"135px\">\nFile:Kilometroak beasain 1977 01.jpg|First edition of the [[Kilometroak]] festival in support of the [[ikastola]]s ([[Beasain]], 1977)\nFile:Muralbelfast2.jpg|A republican mural in Belfast showing solidarity with the [[Basque nationalism]]\nFile:Tram Vitoria-Gasteiz - 8 (8499898767).jpg|[[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] Tram in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] ([[Euskotren]])\nFile:-bakeruntz- armagabetze eguna Baionan (33942124005).jpg|Pro-peace rally in Bayonne on ETA's disarmament day (08/04/2017)\nFile:2017 04 07 lhk encuentro 09.jpg|Tripartite meeting of the three main Basque institutional representatives with peace broker [[Ram Manikkalingam]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Basques]]\n*[[Basque language]]\n*[[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]\n*[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]]\n*[[Navarre]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite web |url= http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi |title=Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia |publisher= EuskoMedia Fundazioa}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.ingeba.org/lurralde/lurranet/lur10/10campbel/10cambel.htm |title=The Century of the Basques: Their Influence in the Geography of the 1500's |last1=Campbell |first1=Craig S.|last2= |first2= |date=1987 |website=Lurralde|publisher=Ingeba}}\n*{{cite book|last=Cavalli-Sforza|first=Luigi Luca|title=Genes, Pueblos y Lenguas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j00kUja-eysC|date=1 June 2000|publisher=Editorial Critica|isbn=978-84-8432-084-5}}\n*{{cite web|last=Cavalli-Sforza|first=Luigi Luca|title=European Genetic Variation|url=http://www.sitesled.com/members/racialreality/genetic_variation.html|work=Online maps|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205101830/http://www.sitesled.com/members/racialreality/genetic_variation.html|archivedate=5 December 2006}}\n*{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=The Basques|year=1990|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0631175652|edition=2nd}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Douglass|first1=William A.|last2=Douglass|first2=Bilbao, J.|date=2005 |title=Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KzfK1QwxDIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=Reno, NV|publisher=University of Nevada Press |isbn=0-87417-625-5}}\n*{{cite book|last=Esparza Zabalegi|first=Jose Mari|title=Euskal Herria Kartografian eta Testigantza Historikoetan | year=2012 | publisher=Euskal Editorea SL | isbn=978-84-936037-9-3}}\n*{{cite book |title= Historia de Pamplona y de sus Lenguas|last=Jimeno Jurio |first=Jose Maria|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995|publisher= Txalaparta |location= Tafalla |isbn=84-8136-017-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnL4obRRmo8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q=803&f=false}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kamen|first1=Henry|last2=|first2=|date=2001 |title=Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htkqJr0SThsC&pg=PP4&lpg=PP4&dq=Philip+V+of+Spain:+The+King+who+Reigned+Twice+kamen&source=bl&ots=CJHegeffQI&sig=e8iDJOdEpJm2jKQ6Lbpt49r-8fw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H_xYVO_mN9HUauuLgIgB&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Philip%20V%20of%20Spain%3A%20The%20King%20who%20Reigned%20Twice%20kamen&f=false|location=|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-30008-718-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|title=Basque History Of The World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQpfod-EQDsC&pg=PT32|date=11 March 2011|publisher=Knopf Canada|isbn=978-0-307-36978-9}}\n*Larrea, Juan Jos\u00e9.

Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith|title=James Naismith|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> The game became established fairly quickly and  grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.\n\n==Early history==\n===Invention of the game===\nThe game of [[basketball]] as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]]) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith|title=James Naismith|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.\nThe first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.<ref name=Republican>{{cite news | title = Basket Football Game | newspaper = Springfield Republican | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | date = March 12, 2002 | url = http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/206238 | accessdate = June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Naismith's original rules===\n[[File:Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball pg 1.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of a basketball game that accompanied Nasmith's article from ''The Triangle'' in 1892 listing his 13 rules.]]\nThere were only thirteen rules of \"basket ball\":\n# The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n# The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.\n# A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.\n# The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\n# No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.\n# A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.\n# If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.\n# A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.\n# When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The \"thrower-in\" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.\n# The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.\n# The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.\n# The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.\n# The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.<ref>Wolff, Alexander.

The peach baskets were closed, and balls had to be retrieved manually, until a small hole was put in the bottom of the peach basket to poke the ball out using a stick. Only in 1906 were metal hoops, nets and backboards introduced.

During [[World War I]], the American Expeditionary Force took basketball wherever it went. Together with the troops, there were hundreds of physical education teachers who knew basketball.

The ABA offered an alternative ethos and game style as well as some changes in the rules.  [[Julius Erving]] was the leading player in the league, and helped launch a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and play above the rim.  His playing strength helped legitimize the American Basketball Association.  The league emphasized excitement and liveliness, be it in the color of the ball (red, white and blue), the manner of play, wild promotions, or the [[three-point shot]]. National recognition and earnings were low, leading the league to look for a way out of its problems.  Merger with the more established and very successful NBA was seen as a solution.  The ABA was folded into the NBA in the summer of 1976, its four most successful franchises (the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs) being incorporated into the older league.<ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\" />  The aggressive, loose style of play and the three-point shot <ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\" /> were taken up by the NBA.\n\n==African Americans in basketball==\n{{ref improve|section|date=December 2016}}\nWith [[racial segregation]] affecting all areas of public life in the U.S. including sports, all-black basketball teams ([[Black Fives]]) were established in 1904.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27215799 \"How 'Black Fives' led to racial integration in basketball\"].

The NBA integrated in 1950\u201351 seasons, just two years after its founding, with three black players each achieving a separate milestone in that process. In the draft held immediately prior to that season, Chuck Cooper became the first black player drafted by an NBA team. Shortly after the draft, Nat Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract. Finally, Earl Lloyd became the first black player to appear in an NBA game as his team started its season before either Cooper's or Clifton's.\n\nAfter the integration of the NBA, the Harlem Globetrotters started to focus on international touring and exhibition performances, including comic routines. These tours helped to popularize basketball internationally, and gave the Globetrotters the reputation as Basketball's goodwill ambassadors.<ref name=HallOfFame>{{cite book|last1=Blevins|first1=Dave|title=The sports hall of fame encyclopedia baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9781461673705|pages=416|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=a7CnkH2HIsQC&pg=PA416|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Modern-day NBA==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2019}}\nThe NBA has helped popularize basketball in other parts of the world. A large part of this is due to the transcendent stars that have played the game through the years.  It was because of the play of [[Michael Jordan]] that basketball started to reach international audiences, especially on the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]], known as the Dream Team.\n\nAfter his final championship and second retirement in 1998, there was a void as in who would be the face of basketball.  Soon after with the help of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Kobe Bryant]] would go on to win three straight championships from 2000\u20132002 with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping make basketball more popular in many places around the world, most noticeably China. Further championships in 2009 and 2010 helped raise his popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/407905-los-angeles-lakers-win-2010-nba-championship|title=Lakers vs. Celtics Game 7: Los Angeles Lakers Win 2010 NBA Championship|first=Matt |last=Wagner|publisher=}}</ref> In 2015, he announced the following season would be his last.

He was taken as the first overall pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and has worked his way to become the face of the NBA and basketball around the world. He left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat along with fellow stars [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Chris Bosh]] in what become known as the controversial decision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrdw.com/sports/headlines/98082929.html|title=LeBron: \"I'm taking my talents to South Beach\"|first=Jake|last=Young|publisher=}}</ref> winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014 where he won a third championship in 2016.

The most noticeable would be [[Yao Ming]]. He was the first ever Chinese player to be selected with the number one overall pick in 2002 by the [[Houston Rockets]]. His play and presence in the NBA brought attention to basketball in Asian countries.\n\nThe style of basketball has evolved over time as well. Basketball, especially in the 90's and 2000's, used to give importance to big men. Games were slow-paced and very defense-oriented. Now because of teams like the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], ball movement and team play is more common. The game has slowly moved away from this type of play. The game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a lot more three point shooting in their offenses. [[Stephen Curry]] of the Golden State Warriors has been a trendsetter with his shooting abilities. In a way he has popularized and re-energized the notion of shooting among the youth.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Women's basketball]]\n* [[Timeline of women's basketball history]]\n* [[Basketball rules]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1 = Arceri | first1 = Mario |last2=Bianchini |first2=Valerio | title = La leggenda del basket | publisher = Baldini Castoldi Dalai | location = Milano | year = 2004 | isbn = 9788884906267 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Peterson |title=Cages to Jump Shots: Pro Basketball's Early Years |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8032-8772-0 }}\n* James Naismith, ''Basketball: Its Origin and Development'', University of Nebraska Press, 1941.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://sports.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=706&lotIdNo=6215 Transcript of Naismith's original notes on the first basketball game]\n* [https://www.usab.com/history/dr-james-naismiths-original-13-rules-of-basketball.aspx  Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basketball]\n* [http://historyscoper.com/basketballscope.html The Historyscoper]\n\n{{basketball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basketball}}\n[[Category:History of basketball|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Account of the history and development of the sport of basketball}}\n{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Multiple issues|{{Original research|date=March 2019}}{{sources|date=March 2019}}{{Missing information|several sections need expansion, NBA history incomplete, history of basketball outside of North America should be incorporated|date=March 2019}}}}\n[[File:Dr. James Naismith.jpg|thumb|[[James Naismith]] invented basketball in 1891 at the [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|International YMCA Training School]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].]]\nThe '''history of basketball''' began with its invention in 1891 in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] by Canadian physical education instructor [[James Naismith]] as a less injury-prone sport than football.

He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.\nThe first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.<ref name=Republican>{{cite news | title = Basket Football Game | newspaper = Springfield Republican | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | date = March 12, 2002 | url = http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/206238 | accessdate = June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Naismith's original rules===\n[[File:Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball pg 1.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of a basketball game that accompanied Nasmith's article from ''The Triangle'' in 1892 listing his 13 rules.]]\nThere were only thirteen rules of \"basket ball\":\n# The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n# The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.\n# A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.\n# The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\n# No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed.

If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.\n# When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The \"thrower-in\" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent.

The ABA offered an alternative ethos and game style as well as some changes in the rules.  [[Julius Erving]] was the leading player in the league, and helped launch a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and play above the rim.  His playing strength helped legitimize the American Basketball Association.  The league emphasized excitement and liveliness, be it in the color of the ball (red, white and blue), the manner of play, wild promotions, or the [[three-point shot]]. National recognition and earnings were low, leading the league to look for a way out of its problems.  Merger with the more established and very successful NBA was seen as a solution.  The ABA was folded into the NBA in the summer of 1976, its four most successful franchises (the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs) being incorporated into the older league.<ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\" />  The aggressive, loose style of play and the three-point shot <ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\" /> were taken up by the NBA.\n\n==African Americans in basketball==\n{{ref improve|section|date=December 2016}}\nWith [[racial segregation]] affecting all areas of public life in the U.S. including sports, all-black basketball teams ([[Black Fives]]) were established in 1904.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27215799 \"How 'Black Fives' led to racial integration in basketball\"].

The NBA integrated in 1950\u201351 seasons, just two years after its founding, with three black players each achieving a separate milestone in that process. In the draft held immediately prior to that season, Chuck Cooper became the first black player drafted by an NBA team. Shortly after the draft, Nat Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract. Finally, Earl Lloyd became the first black player to appear in an NBA game as his team started its season before either Cooper's or Clifton's.\n\nAfter the integration of the NBA, the Harlem Globetrotters started to focus on international touring and exhibition performances, including comic routines. These tours helped to popularize basketball internationally, and gave the Globetrotters the reputation as Basketball's goodwill ambassadors.<ref name=HallOfFame>{{cite book|last1=Blevins|first1=Dave|title=The sports hall of fame encyclopedia baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9781461673705|pages=416|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=a7CnkH2HIsQC&pg=PA416|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Modern-day NBA==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2019}}\nThe NBA has helped popularize basketball in other parts of the world. A large part of this is due to the transcendent stars that have played the game through the years.  It was because of the play of [[Michael Jordan]] that basketball started to reach international audiences, especially on the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]], known as the Dream Team.\n\nAfter his final championship and second retirement in 1998, there was a void as in who would be the face of basketball.  Soon after with the help of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Kobe Bryant]] would go on to win three straight championships from 2000\u20132002 with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping make basketball more popular in many places around the world, most noticeably China. Further championships in 2009 and 2010 helped raise his popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/407905-los-angeles-lakers-win-2010-nba-championship|title=Lakers vs. Celtics Game 7: Los Angeles Lakers Win 2010 NBA Championship|first=Matt |last=Wagner|publisher=}}</ref> In 2015, he announced the following season would be his last.

He was taken as the first overall pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and has worked his way to become the face of the NBA and basketball around the world. He left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat along with fellow stars [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Chris Bosh]] in what become known as the controversial decision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrdw.com/sports/headlines/98082929.html|title=LeBron: \"I'm taking my talents to South Beach\"|first=Jake|last=Young|publisher=}}</ref> winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014 where he won a third championship in 2016.

The most noticeable would be [[Yao Ming]]. He was the first ever Chinese player to be selected with the number one overall pick in 2002 by the [[Houston Rockets]]. His play and presence in the NBA brought attention to basketball in Asian countries.\n\nThe style of basketball has evolved over time as well. Basketball, especially in the 90's and 2000's, used to give importance to big men. Games were slow-paced and very defense-oriented. Now because of teams like the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], ball movement and team play is more common. The game has slowly moved away from this type of play. The game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a lot more three point shooting in their offenses. [[Stephen Curry]] of the Golden State Warriors has been a trendsetter with his shooting abilities. In a way he has popularized and re-energized the notion of shooting among the youth.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Women's basketball]]\n* [[Timeline of women's basketball history]]\n* [[Basketball rules]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1 = Arceri | first1 = Mario |last2=Bianchini |first2=Valerio | title = La leggenda del basket | publisher = Baldini Castoldi Dalai | location = Milano | year = 2004 | isbn = 9788884906267 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Peterson |title=Cages to Jump Shots: Pro Basketball's Early Years |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8032-8772-0 }}\n* James Naismith, ''Basketball: Its Origin and Development'', University of Nebraska Press, 1941.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://sports.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=706&lotIdNo=6215 Transcript of Naismith's original notes on the first basketball game]\n* [https://www.usab.com/history/dr-james-naismiths-original-13-rules-of-basketball.aspx  Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basketball]\n* [http://historyscoper.com/basketballscope.html The Historyscoper]\n\n{{basketball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basketball}}\n[[Category:History of basketball|*]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe first basketball game:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: wasn\u2019t \u2192 wasn't, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_basketball"}

Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with \"Home of the Big Red Strawberry\" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.\n\nThe more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the [[Stave River]], which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, [[Stave Lake]] and [[Hayward Lake]]. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper [[Alouette Lake]]. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]]; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Snow-capped mountain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Robie Reid lies just past Mission's northern boundary.]]Over 40% of Mission is actually tree farm, making it only one of two communities with municipal [[tree farm]]s. (Revelstoke BC, with a much smaller and newer farm, is the second.) Mission's tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.  It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district's northern boundary near the foot of [[Mount Robie Reid]]; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of [[Alouette Lake]] (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).\n\nThe eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]] and [[Nicomen Island]] to [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]] are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as [[McConnell Creek, British Columbia|McConnell Creek]] and [[Durieu, British Columbia|Durieu]]; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large [[First Nations]] community at the Indian Reserves of the [[Leq' a: mel First Nation]], formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on [[Nicomen Island]] and [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]].\n\n==Government==\nMission was incorporated in 1892 and is {{convert|225.78|km2|abbr=on}} in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.\n\nThe District of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Mayor and Council, was elected on November 15, 2018. The current mayor is [[Pam Alexis]]. A notable past mayor is [[Randy Hawes]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mission Junction (HS85-10-22902).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mission's old CPR train station in 1910]]\nThe Town of Mission City began as a land promotion. The town's core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through [[James Welton Horne|James Horne's]] auction, the \"Great Land Sale\" May 19, 1891<ref>https://missionmuseum.com/local-history/the-great-land-sale/</ref>, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]] on June 19, 1893.<ref name=\"Old Document\">\"Old Document Reveals Board Founded in '93\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 19 April 1945.</ref> It was the first [[Board of Trade]] in B.C.\"<ref name=\"First Board\">Kask, Glen. \"First board of trade in B.C.\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 16 June 1993.</ref> Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town's location at the junction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline with a northward extension of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site's proximity to the historic [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School|St. Mary's Mission]] of the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the [[Peckquaylis Indian Reserve]]).\n\nAt the time of founding, the swing-span [[Mission Railway Bridge]] opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the [[Alexandra Bridge (Trans-Canada)|Alexandra Bridge]], and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the [[New Westminster Bridge]] at [[New Westminster]] was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new [[Mission Bridge]] was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring [[freshet]].\n\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Laurier at Mission City, British Columbia (HS85-10-22903).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] visiting Mission City, 1910]]\nMission City's original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town's founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life.  Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmuseum.com/ |title=From public display at the Mission Museum |publisher=Missionmuseum.com |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe western part of the district, the [[Stave Valley]], is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the [[Bridge River Power Project]] opened in 1961. It was built by the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The [[Stave Falls Power Co.]] operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the [[Stave Falls Dam|dam]] at [[Stave Falls]]. During the construction of the [[Ruskin Dam]] (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.\n\nFlanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]], although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the [[Stave River]]. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of [[Rolley Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nUp against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin's neighbourhoods.\n\nThe building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its \"anchor\", the main Eaton's department store in the Valley, and the town's Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Mission Post Office British Columbia Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Mission Post Office, First Avenue at Welton Avenue in the heart of Mission's commercial core]]Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission's retail community has never regained its former prominence in the [[Fraser Valley]]. Burgeoning \"[[Commuter town|exurban]]\" population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the [[Lower Mainland]] and encouraged by a new [[commuter rail]] line direct to downtown Vancouver, the [[West Coast Express]], has reversed this trend.\nOutside of the core \"urban\" area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, 7 kilometres west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants (including the Gagliardi family); their descendants reside there to this day. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.\n\nSteelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver's press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before [[World War II]], there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.\n\n[[File:Seminary of Christ the King & Westminster Abbey, Mission, BC 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Westminster Abbey]]In 1954, [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s obtained land near Mission, where they set up their [[Westminster Abbey (British Columbia)|Westminster Abbey]] and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.\n\nThe berry industry, formerly the district's largest and most important, formed the heart of the town's annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry ([[Japanese Canadian Internment|relocation]] of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating [[Fraser River#Flooding|flood]] of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the [[Soap Box Derby]], which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.\n\nMission's other major industry was logging, and the town's several mills were noted for being the world's largest suppliers of red cedar [[shake (shingle)|shake]]s and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own [[tree farm]], covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s the Soap Box Derby shared [[Dominion Day]] with a large [[Loggers Sports]] event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the [[North American Loggers Sports Association]] circuit.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at [[Whonnock, British Columbia|Whonnock]] outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission's city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in [[Hull, Quebec]].\n\nAdjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission's supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 [[Fraser River]] flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province's largest [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[grow-op]], in a scandal involving one of the town's wealthiest families.\n\nMission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, [[Mission Raceway Park]], which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.\n\nIn 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission's Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a [[Ferndale Institution|minimum]] security facility, and the other is a [[Mission Institution|medium security]] prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of [[Stave Lake]], opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, [[forestry]], hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission's chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.\n\nForest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on [[Western Redcedar|redcedar]] shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.\n\nMission's largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mission City railway station (5993731063).jpg|thumb|left|The West Coast Express station in 2011]]\nTransportation infrastructure includes [[British Columbia Highway 11|Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway 7]]. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the [[West Coast Express]], which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between [[Vancouver]] and [[Mission City Station]].  Bus service in Mission is served by the [[Central Fraser Valley Transit System]] connecting with the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|City of Abbotsford]], as well as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] with service to [[Coquitlam Central Station]] via route 701.\nThree days per week [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[The Canadian]]'' provides eastbound flag stop service from [[Mission Harbour railway station]].\n\nMission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round. Boat tours run from Mission's docks on Harbour Avenue, which are also home to sport and commercial fishing vessels; the Fraser has famous salmon runs and population of [[green sturgeon]].\n\n[[File:Missionbridge.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mission Bridge carries Highway 11.  Following this bridge's opening much of the town's retail business was lost to Abbotsford.]]\n\n==Climate==\nMission has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. However, Mission has plentiful rainfall all year round, with a drying trend in the summer.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mission\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 15.6\n|Feb record high C = 20.6\n|Mar record high C = 22.5\n|Apr record high C = 28.0\n|May record high C = 36.5\n|Jun record high C = 36.0\n|Jul record high C = 37.8\n|Aug record high C = 36.5\n|Sep record high C = 36.0\n|Oct record high C = 27.0\n|Nov record high C = 18.9\n|Dec record high C = 17.5\n|year record high C = 37.8\n|Jan high C = 5.1\n|Feb high C = 8.0\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.6\n|May high C = 17.4\n|Jun high C = 19.9\n|Jul high C = 23.5\n|Aug high C = 23.4\n|Sep high C = 20.9\n|Oct high C = 14.9\n|Nov high C = 8.9\n|Dec high C = 6.0\n|year high C = 14.5\n|Jan mean C = 2.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 6.8\n|Apr mean C = 9.7\n|May mean C = 12.6\n|Jun mean C = 15.1\n|Jul mean C = 17.9\n|Aug mean C = 18.0\n|Sep mean C = 15.6\n|Oct mean C = 10.9\n|Nov mean C = 6.1\n|Dec mean C = 3.5\n|year mean C = 10.3\n|Jan low C = \u22120.2\n|Feb low C = 1.3\n|Mar low C = 2.7\n|Apr low C = 4.8\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.3\n|Jul low C = 12.3\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.4\n|Oct low C = 6.7\n|Nov low C = 3.2\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 6.1\n|Jan record low C = \u221214.4\n|Feb record low C = \u221215.5\n|Mar record low C = \u221212.2\n|Apr record low C = \u22122.8\n|May record low C = \u22122.2\n|Jun record low C = 2.2\n|Jul record low C = 4.4\n|Aug record low C = 5.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = \u22123.5\n|Nov record low C = \u221213.3\n|Dec record low C = \u221219.4\n|year record low C = \u221219.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 217.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 190.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 154.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 129.7\n|May precipitation mm = 102.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 100.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 63.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 74.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 77.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 141.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 252.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 260.1\n|year precipitation mm = 1764.5\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 197.3\n|Feb rain mm = 178.8\n|Mar rain mm = 151.2\n|Apr rain mm = 129.5\n|May rain mm = 102.5\n|Jun rain mm = 100.6\n|Jul rain mm = 63.6\n|Aug rain mm = 74.0\n|Sep rain mm = 77.9\n|Oct rain mm = 141.1\n|Nov rain mm = 249.1\n|Dec rain mm = 242.9\n|year rain mm = 1708.5\n|Jan snow cm = 19.7\n|Feb snow cm = 11.9\n|Mar snow cm = 3.4\n|Apr snow cm = 0.2\n|May snow cm = 0\n|Jun snow cm = 0\n|Jul snow cm = 0\n|Aug snow cm = 0\n|Sep snow cm = 0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.1\n|Nov snow cm = 3.6\n|Dec snow cm = 17.2\n|year snow cm = 56.0\n|unit precipitation days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 19.3\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.0\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.0\n|May precipitation days = 15.6\n|Jun precipitation days = 14.4\n|Jul precipitation days = 9.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.6\n|Sep precipitation days = 9.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 15.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 20.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 21.6\n|year precipitation days= 186.0\n|unit rain days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 17.3\n|Feb rain days = 15.8\n|Mar rain days = 17.6\n|Apr rain days = 15.0\n|May rain days = 15.6\n|Jun rain days = 14.4\n|Jul rain days = 9.7\n|Aug rain days = 9.6\n|Sep rain days = 9.8\n|Oct rain days = 15.4\n|Nov rain days = 20.4\n|Dec rain days = 19.5\n|year rain days= 180.1\n|unit snow days= 0.2 cm\n|Jan snow days = 4.2\n|Feb snow days = 2.3\n|Mar snow days = 1.1\n|Apr snow days = 0.17\n|May snow days = 0.03\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0.06\n|Nov snow days = 0.82\n|Dec snow days = 3.7\n|year snow days= 12.4\n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"climate\">[[Environment Canada]]\u2014[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=809&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000], accessed 24 November 2012</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nMission offers few jobs, so many residents (more than 6 out of 10) commute to work in other locales.

Many ''[[issei]]'', or first time immigrants, included prospective farmers and \"picture brides\", or women who communicated with suitors through the mail for the purpose of marriage. Organizations established in Mission included the  Japanese Farmer's Association (Nokai), established in 1916; the Mission Judo Club; the Mission Buddhist Church; and a Japanese Language School. The ethnic Japanese people in Mission had {{convert|979.304|acre|ha}} of land on 103 properties by 1930. During the pre-[[World War II]] era 30% of Mission's public school enrollment consisted of ethnic Japanese. The Nokai had 79 members in 1942. The World War II-era [[Japanese Canadian internment]] disrupted Mission's ethnic Japanese community as their properties were confiscated, and productivity decreased as the farms were managed by their new non-Japanese. Many Japanese chose not to move back to Mission in the post-war era, even though they were permitted to come back in 1949.<ref name=WongJapanese>Wong, Kathy. \"[http://www.missionmuseum.com/milestone-japanese-canadians.php Japanese-Canadian Community in Mission]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150110173040/http://www.missionmuseum.com/milestone-japanese-canadians.php Archive]).

territories of Canada|province]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada.  It was incorporated as a district municipality in 1892, growing to include additional villages and rural areas over the years, adding the original Town of '''Mission City''', long an independent core of the region, in 1969.\n\nIt is situated on the north bank of the [[Fraser River]], backing onto mountains and lakes overlooking the [[Fraser Valley|Central Fraser Valley]], {{convert|80|km|miles|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\n==Geography==\nUnlike the other [[Fraser Valley]] municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the Fraser River. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with \"Home of the Big Red Strawberry\" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.\n\nThe more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the [[Stave River]], which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, [[Stave Lake]] and [[Hayward Lake]]. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper [[Alouette Lake]]. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]]; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Snow-capped mountain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Robie Reid lies just past Mission's northern boundary.]]Over 40% of Mission is actually tree farm, making it only one of two communities with municipal [[tree farm]]s. (Revelstoke BC, with a much smaller and newer farm, is the second.) Mission's tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.  It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district's northern boundary near the foot of [[Mount Robie Reid]]; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of [[Alouette Lake]] (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).\n\nThe eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]] and [[Nicomen Island]] to [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]] are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as [[McConnell Creek, British Columbia|McConnell Creek]] and [[Durieu, British Columbia|Durieu]]; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large [[First Nations]] community at the Indian Reserves of the [[Leq' a: mel First Nation]], formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on [[Nicomen Island]] and [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]].\n\n==Government==\nMission was incorporated in 1892 and is {{convert|225.78|km2|abbr=on}} in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.\n\nThe District of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Mayor and Council, was elected on November 15, 2018. The current mayor is [[Pam Alexis]]. A notable past mayor is [[Randy Hawes]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mission Junction (HS85-10-22902).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mission's old CPR train station in 1910]]\nThe Town of Mission City began as a land promotion. The town's core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through [[James Welton Horne|James Horne's]] auction, the \"Great Land Sale\" May 19, 1891<ref>https://missionmuseum.com/local-history/the-great-land-sale/</ref>, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]] on June 19, 1893.<ref name=\"Old Document\">\"Old Document Reveals Board Founded in '93\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 19 April 1945.</ref> It was the first [[Board of Trade]] in B.C.\"<ref name=\"First Board\">Kask, Glen. \"First board of trade in B.C.\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 16 June 1993.</ref> Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town's location at the junction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline with a northward extension of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site's proximity to the historic [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School|St. Mary's Mission]] of the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the [[Peckquaylis Indian Reserve]]).\n\nAt the time of founding, the swing-span [[Mission Railway Bridge]] opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the [[Alexandra Bridge (Trans-Canada)|Alexandra Bridge]], and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the [[New Westminster Bridge]] at [[New Westminster]] was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new [[Mission Bridge]] was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring [[freshet]].\n\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Laurier at Mission City, British Columbia (HS85-10-22903).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] visiting Mission City, 1910]]\nMission City's original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town's founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life.  Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmuseum.com/ |title=From public display at the Mission Museum |publisher=Missionmuseum.com |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe western part of the district, the [[Stave Valley]], is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the [[Bridge River Power Project]] opened in 1961. It was built by the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The [[Stave Falls Power Co.]] operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the [[Stave Falls Dam|dam]] at [[Stave Falls]]. During the construction of the [[Ruskin Dam]] (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.\n\nFlanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]], although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the [[Stave River]]. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of [[Rolley Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nUp against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin's neighbourhoods.\n\nThe building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its \"anchor\", the main Eaton's department store in the Valley, and the town's Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Mission Post Office British Columbia Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Mission Post Office, First Avenue at Welton Avenue in the heart of Mission's commercial core]]Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission's retail community has never regained its former prominence in the [[Fraser Valley]]. Burgeoning \"[[Commuter town|exurban]]\" population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the [[Lower Mainland]] and encouraged by a new [[commuter rail]] line direct to downtown Vancouver, the [[West Coast Express]], has reversed this trend.\nOutside of the core \"urban\" area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, 7 kilometres west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants (including the Gagliardi family); their descendants reside there to this day. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.\n\nSteelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver's press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before [[World War II]], there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.\n\n[[File:Seminary of Christ the King & Westminster Abbey, Mission, BC 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Westminster Abbey]]In 1954, [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s obtained land near Mission, where they set up their [[Westminster Abbey (British Columbia)|Westminster Abbey]] and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.\n\nThe berry industry, formerly the district's largest and most important, formed the heart of the town's annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry ([[Japanese Canadian Internment|relocation]] of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating [[Fraser River#Flooding|flood]] of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the [[Soap Box Derby]], which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.\n\nMission's other major industry was logging, and the town's several mills were noted for being the world's largest suppliers of red cedar [[shake (shingle)|shake]]s and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own [[tree farm]], covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s the Soap Box Derby shared [[Dominion Day]] with a large [[Loggers Sports]] event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the [[North American Loggers Sports Association]] circuit.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at [[Whonnock, British Columbia|Whonnock]] outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission's city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in [[Hull, Quebec]].\n\nAdjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission's supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 [[Fraser River]] flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province's largest [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[grow-op]], in a scandal involving one of the town's wealthiest families.\n\nMission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, [[Mission Raceway Park]], which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.\n\nIn 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission's Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a [[Ferndale Institution|minimum]] security facility, and the other is a [[Mission Institution|medium security]] prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of [[Stave Lake]], opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, [[forestry]], hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission's chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.\n\nForest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on [[Western Redcedar|redcedar]] shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.\n\nMission's largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mission City railway station (5993731063).jpg|thumb|left|The West Coast Express station in 2011]]\nTransportation infrastructure includes [[British Columbia Highway 11|Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway 7]]. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the [[West Coast Express]], which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between [[Vancouver]] and [[Mission City Station]].  Bus service in Mission is served by the [[Central Fraser Valley Transit System]] connecting with the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|City of Abbotsford]], as well as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] with service to [[Coquitlam Central Station]] via route 701.\nThree days per week [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[The Canadian]]'' provides eastbound flag stop service from [[Mission Harbour railway station]].\n\nMission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round. Boat tours run from Mission's docks on Harbour Avenue, which are also home to sport and commercial fishing vessels; the Fraser has famous salmon runs and population of [[green sturgeon]].\n\n[[File:Missionbridge.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mission Bridge carries Highway 11.  Following this bridge's opening much of the town's retail business was lost to Abbotsford.]]\n\n==Climate==\nMission has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean.

It was founded in the first half of the 13th century by [[Daniel of Galicia|Danylo Romanowych]] and served as an Orthodox Church and then as a Greek Catholic Church. The present church was founded in 1735-56 by the Greek Catholic Che\u0142m bishop Philip W\u0142odkowic and was built according to the plans of Pawe\u0142 Fontana. It is a late [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] church built in the shape of a [[Latin cross]], three-aisled basilica with a huge eight-part dome.\n\n==History==\nA former Greek Catholic Cathedral and currently the Parish church, the Basilica of the Virgin Mary stands on the site of an Orthodox church of the same name, founded by [[Danylo of Halych|Daniel Romanowicz]] in about 1260.\n\nAfter a fire in 1640, it was rebuilt by bishop Metody Terlecki who introduced some small changes. As the years went by, the church needed to be enlarged and in 1711 bishop J\u00f3zef Lewicki began repair works and built a [[transept]]. Unfortunately, it turned out that the work was done so unreliably that the building was close to collapse. The successor of Lewicki, bishop Felicjan Wo\u0142odkowicz considered the building's condition to be so bad that renovation was no longer an option and therefore commissioned its demolition. In 1735 the work began and a completely new, much bigger church was built, which was ready in 1756. That time, in curia sat on bishop [[Maksymilian Rylo]], who finished the investment and founded rich decoration of sanctuary.<ref>[http://www.kuria.lublin.pl/parafie/chelm-narodzenia/stara/bazylika.htm Bazylika Narodzenia Naj\u015bwi\u0119tszej Maryi Panny<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235846/http://www.kuria.lublin.pl/parafie/chelm-narodzenia/stara/bazylika.htm |date=March 31, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 September 1765 the church was the place of the coronation of the marvellous painting of the [[Our Lady of Che\u0142m]].
