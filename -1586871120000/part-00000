The second element ''krathum'' (Thai: \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21) means 'bur-flower tree' (''Anthocephalus chinensis'').\n\n==Geography==\nBang Krathum's topography consists of flat, fertile lowlands.  Clockwise from the north, the subdistrict is bordered by [[Wang Nam Khu]] (of [[Mueang Phitsanulok District]]), [[Tha Tan]], [[Nakhon Pa Mak]], [[Phai Lom, Phitsanulok|Phai Lom]], [[Ta Fo]] (of [[Mueang Phichit District]] in [[Phichit Province]]), [[Sanam Khli]], [[Khok Salut]] and [[Ban Rai]]. Bang Krathum lies in the [[Nan River#Nan Basin|Nan Basin]], which is part of the [[Chao Phraya River#Chao Phraya watershed|Chao Phraya Watershed]]. The town of [[Ban Bang Krathum]] is on the tambon's chief watercourse, a canal which winds through farms heading north-east to Ban Bang Kranoi in [[Nakhon Pa Mak]], where it joins the [[Wang Thong River]]. The canal splits once between Ban Bang Krathum and Ban Bang Krathum, where a smaller branch leads due north to Ban Bueng Lam in [[Nakhon Pa Mak]].\n\n==Administration==\nThe subdistrict is divided into 11 smaller divisions called (''[[muban]]''), which roughly correspond to the six villages in Bang Krathum.  Bang Krathum is administered by a [[Tambon administrative organization]] (TAO). The mubans in Bang Krathum are enumerated as follows:\n<ref name=\"Pitlocal.org\">[https://www.pitloklocal.org/songko47.xls Bang Krathum at Pitlocal.org]{{dead link|date=October 2016

The show is set in Mirador de Montepinar, a condominium located in the suburbs of [[Madrid]]. The show is an indirect successor to the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] comedy ''[[Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva]]''. The name is a pun on the verb \"avecinarse\", which means both \"become neighbour to\" and \"approach\", and is used in expression ''la que se avecina'' meaning \"the trouble that is approaching\", so it alludes both to being neighbours and the friction that exists between the characters.\n\n''La que se avecina'' debuted on Telecinco, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n|FDF]] and [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Espa\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' vs 'La que se avecina': el duelo resucita en la TDT |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/15023/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-vs-la-que-se-avecina-el-duelo-resucita-en-la-tdt/ |work=FormulaTV |date=11 May 2010 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='La que se avecina' y 'Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' tambi\u00e9n triunfan en Paramount Comedy |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/23559/la-que-se-avecina-aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-tambien-triunfan-paramount-comedy/ |work=Formula TV |date=12 February 2012 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref> The series debuted on 22 April 2007, the show began to become much more prominent in its third season, becoming one of the most widely watched shows in Spain.

On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaqu\u00edn is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the show flat on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Mait\u00e9 Figueroa Espinosa and their three children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father. The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentine and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to marry Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Mait\u00e9 takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Mait\u00e9 remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Mait\u00e9 alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Mait\u00e9, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Mait\u00e9, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is Judith and Enrique's marriage. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first nine episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Mait\u00e9, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Mait\u00e9, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and marry. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Mait\u00e9 continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job at Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after six months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Mait\u00e9 leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Mait\u00e9 and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Mait\u00e9 will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn. Mait\u00e9 writes an erotic novel based on the romances of Mirador de Montepinar. Berta will go to a spa at her bachelorette party with the girls in the building and she will meet Araceli with whom she is about to go to bed when the owner of the spa (Araceli's girlfriend) sees them. Araceli when she breaks up with her, without a house, goes to Bajo B and will make Enrique and Teresa break up. Judith tries to return with Trevor but he already expects a son with another girl. Rebeca throws her out of the house and goes with Dylan to live with Enrique. La Chusa and Ferm\u00edn break up and she refuses to leave, even though she does not pay the rent. Raquel falls in love with Diego, Fina's son, but Fina intervenes and gets Diego to think that she is crazy. Antonio sees how his son is now: a woman. It happens to be called \u00c1lvaro a Alba. Alba starts dating Leo. Antonio and Berta marry. To Mait\u00e9 they publish the book to him and it is reconciled with Amador and buys with him the Under A, where La Chusa de okupa is. Enrique, fed up with Judith, Araceli and Teresa treating him badly, leaves them with a note.\n\n===Season 9 (2016)===\nVicente is named the new president of Mirador de Montepinar. His consort Ferm\u00edn, moves with him to 2\u00baB to help him with the mandate since Vicente is not excited. However, the power of these two will be full of ups and downs. Enrique returns to the community because his party has named him mayor after the departure of Mar\u00eda Teresa. Enrique will have to learn from Crist\u00f3bal, a corrupt politician. After eight seasons, Leo dies when the parachute is not opened in a gift from Alba. Alba overcomes her depression with Teodoro, Amador's brother, with whom she marries. Teodoro refloats his father-in-law Antonio's fishmonger, but his friendship is not earned. Alba will save to do the sex change operation and then will have to wait to be able to \"consummate\" which is what Theodore is waiting impatiently. After the departure of Rebeca, Judith will not stop giving emotional thrombi. Between his ligues they are: a trainer obsessed with the sport, a homosexual catholic, a patient with an imaginary friend, Trevor, a millionaire friend of Javi ... At the end of the season he goes to Ibiza where he falls in love and leaves the Serie. Mait\u00e9 is again what it was like: a penny with money. With La Chusa as a maid, Mait\u00e9 pays Amador a salary to keep custody of her four children, some spoiled. Start a relationship with Hector, a hipster. Amador rents 2\u00baA with Teodoro. Then he meets Yolanda \"Yoli\" a seamstress with a safe and problematic character. Yoli will bring her mother, Menchu, noisy and like her daughter, causing several problems, such as: Causing Teodoro and Alba to leave the 2nd A and leave with Antonio and Berta, not accept that Amador leaves him and try to have children with him, renting Enrique the Low B after the departure of Araceli and settling in Attic A with his mother at the end of the season. Besides, they emphasize their fights with Mait\u00e9, Alba ... The relationship between Nines and Coque will go through problems. Fermin tries to conquer Araceli until she leaves. Fine take it with Javi and Lola, who are still fighting for their love despite their debts. Bruno is a pianist who has just been abandoned by his wife. She becomes a patient of Judith and needs her help so much that she moves to the 1st B, property of the late Leo. Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... Al final the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has, so Mait\u00e9 hires a hit man. Theodore breaks up with Alba because he did not like it when they made love. The hit man shoots Amador but he covers himself with Theodore without knowing if he lives or dies. Diego returns, the son of Fina. Diego sees at last how his mother really is and it seems that he is going to send her to a nursing home. Besides, a relationship with Raquel begins, with which it seems that he is leaving for China. It is not known if Theodore lives or if Raquel and Fina have left.\n\n===Season 10 (2017\u201318)===\nFina escapes from the nursing home where she was interned and returns to live at 2&nbsp;\u00b0C. Berta and Antonio are still married but the latter wants them to live separately and goes to live with Enrique, leaving Berta living at 1&nbsp;\u00b0C along with her daughter Alba, who is now single because she has left him with Teodoro. Both will have to carry with difficulty the business of Mariscos Recios, before the passivity of its owner to 50%, Antonio. Alba will be attracted to Enrique throughout the season and will have several encounters behind Antonio's back. After the departure of Judith, are Yoli and Menchu who buy Attic A, characters that will cause multiple problems in the building. Ferm\u00edn, who continues his relationship with Menchu, will go live with them. In addition, he will continue to serve as \"Richelieu\" of the new president, Bruno Quiroga. The latter will try to maintain an asexual relationship with Mait\u00e9, who will also have meetings with Hector, who has returned to Montepinar. Coque ends his relationship with Nines and takes vacations, leaving the community with the vacant janitor plaza. In addition, he goes to live with Enrique and Antonio at Bajo B. The latter recover the bar from the catastrophic rental contract that Enrique maintained with Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, baptizing him as Tony & Henry. Nines leaves her job and instead it will be Alba who at first helps her father in the business. Theodore and Amador are again the only tenants of the second. The latter will try to recover Yoli's love, although she passes from him; Meanwhile, he will pretend to be Fina's caregiver in front of Diego, his son, in exchange for a salary and with the objective that Diego stays calm and stops visiting his mother so much. Diego will begin a relationship with Raquel and will take her to China although eventually she returns. Mait\u00e9 will have to share with her assistant La Chusa with Bruno, who also hires her and who also gets pregnant through artificial insemination. During Coque's vacation period, Ferm\u00edn hired Clara as her fellow, who is Menchu's niece and whom she recommends to minimize an important expense such as the janitor's salary.\n\n==Cast and

In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Mait\u00e9 Figueroa Espinosa and their three children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father. The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentine and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to marry Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Mait\u00e9 takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Mait\u00e9 remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Mait\u00e9 alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Mait\u00e9, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Mait\u00e9, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is Judith and Enrique's marriage. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first nine episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Mait\u00e9, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Mait\u00e9, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and get married. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Mait\u00e9 continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job at Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after six months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Mait\u00e9 leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Mait\u00e9 and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Mait\u00e9 will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn.

Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... Al final the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has, so Mait\u00e9 hires a hit man.

''Atlantis'' was commanded by ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' [[Bernhard Rogge]], who received the [[Iron Cross|Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. She was sunk on 22 November 1941 by the British [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}.\n\nCommerce raiders do not seek to engage warships, but rather attack enemy merchant shipping; the measures of success are tonnage destroyed (or captured) and time spent at large. ''Atlantis'' was second only to {{Ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} in tonnage destroyed, and had the longest raiding career of any German commerce raider in either world war. She captured highly secret documents from {{SS|Automedon}}. A version of the story of ''Atlantis'' is told in the film ''[[Under Ten Flags]]'' with [[Van Heflin]] appearing as Captain Rogge.\n\n==Early history==\nBuilt by [[Bremer Vulkan]] in 1937,<ref name=mohr/> she began her career as the [[cargo ship]] ''Goldenfels'', owned and operated by [[DDG Hansa]], [[Bremen]].

She had a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] amidships. She had a crew of 349 (21 officers and 328 enlisted sailors) and a [[Scottish terrier]], Ferry, as mascot. The cruiser carried a dummy funnel and variable-height masts, and was well supplied with paint, canvas, and materials for further altering her appearance, including costumes for the crew and flags. ''Atlantis'' was capable of being modified to twenty-six different silhouettes.\n\n===Weapons and aircraft===\nThe ship was equipped with six {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, one {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun on the bow, two twin-37&nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and four [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm automatic cannon]]s; all of these were hidden, mostly behind pivotable false deck or side structures. A phony crane and [[deckhouse]] on the aft section hid two of the {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns; the other four guns were concealed via flaps in the side<ref>Muggenthaler, August Karl ''German Raiders of World War II'' Prentice-Hall, 1977, {{ISBN|0-13-354027-8}}, p16</ref><ref name=rogge>Rogge, Bernhard ''The German Raider Atlantis'', Ballantine, 1956</ref>{{rp|46}} that were raised when action was imminent. ''Atlantis'' also had four waterline [[torpedo tube]]s, and a 92-[[Naval mine|mine]] compartment. This gave her the fire power, and more importantly the fire control, of a light cruiser. The ship also carried two [[Heinkel He 114|Heinkel He-114C]] [[seaplane]]s in one of its holds, one of these was fully assembled and the other one was packed away in crates.<ref name=Duffy>{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=James P.|title=Hitler's secret pirate fleet : the deadliest ships of World War II|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

Retrieved 16 February 2020.</ref>]]\n===Journey to the South Atlantic===\nIn 1939, she became the command of ''Kapit\u00e4n'' [[Bernhard Rogge]]. Commissioned in mid-December, she was the first of nine or ten merchant ships armed by the [[Third Reich]] for the purposes of seeking out and engaging enemy cargo vessels. ''Atlantis'' was delayed by ice until 31 March 1940,<ref name=\"Turner22\">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=L.C.F.|title=War in the Southern Oceans: 1939\u201345|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=22}}</ref> when the former [[battleship]] {{ship|SMS|Hessen||2}} was sent to act as an [[icebreaker]], clearing the way for ''Atlantis'', ''Orion'', and ''Widder''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

By this time, ''Atlantis'' was pretending to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vessel named ''Kim'' by flying the Soviet naval ensign, displaying a hammer and sickle on the bridge, and having Russian and English warnings on the stern, \"Keep clear of propellers\". The Soviet Union was neutral at the time.\n\nAfter crossing the equator, on 24\u201325 April, she took the guise of the Japanese vessel ''Kasii Maru''. The ship now displayed a large K upon a red-topped funnel, identification of the [[K Line]] transportation company. She also had rising sun symbols on the gun flaps and Japanese characters (copied from a magazine) on the aft hull.\n\n===''City of Exeter''===\nOn 2 May, she met the British passenger liner {{SS|City of Exeter}}. Rogge, unwilling to cause non-combatant casualties, declined to attack. Once the ships had parted, ''Exeter''{{'}}s Master radioed his suspicions about the \"Japanese\" ship to the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=bismarckclass>[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/hilfskreuzer/atlantis.html Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser / Raider) Atlantis \u2013 The History]</ref>\n\n===''Scientist''===\nOn 3 May, ''Atlantis'' met a British [[cargo ship]], ''Scientist'', which was carrying [[ore]] and [[jute]]. The Germans raised their [[battle ensign]] and displayed signal pennants stating, \"Stop or I fire! Don't use your radio!\" The {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun fired a warning shot. The British immediately began transmitting their alarm signal, \"QQQQ...QQQQ...Unidentified merchantman has ordered me to stop\", and the Germans began transmitting so as to jam the signals.\n\n''Scientist'' turned to flee, but on the second salvo from ''Atlantis'' flames exploded from the ship, followed by a cloud of dust and then white steam from the boilers. A British sailor was killed and the remaining 77 were taken as prisoners of war. After failing to sink the ship with demolition charges, ''Atlantis'' used guns and a torpedo to finish off ''Scientist''.\n\n===Cape Agulhas===\nContinuing to sail south, ''Atlantis'' passed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching [[Cape Agulhas]] on 10 May. Here she set up a minefield with 92 horned contact [[naval mine]]s, in a way which suggested that a U-boat had laid them. The minefield was successful, but the deception was foiled and the ship's presence revealed by a German [[propaganda]] [[broadcast]] boasting that \"a minefield, sown by a German raider\" had sunk no fewer than eight merchant ships, three more were overdue, three minesweepers were involved, and the Royal Navy was not capable of finding \"a solitary raider\" operating in \"its own back yard\". Furthermore, a British signal was sent from Ceylon on 20 May and intercepted by Germany, based on the report from ''City of Exeter'', warning shipping of a German raider disguised as a Japanese ship.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n''Atlantis'' headed into the [[Indian Ocean]] disguised as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] vessel MV ''Abbekerk''.

Filled with supplies for Australian troops in the Middle East, ''Tirranna'' was captured and sent to France.\n\nOn 11 July, the liner ''City of Baghdad'' was fired upon at a range of {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A boarding party discovered a copy of ''[[Broadcasting for Allied Merchant Ships]]'', which contained communications codes. ''City of Baghdad'', like ''Atlantis'', was a former [[DDG Hansa]] ship, having been captured by the British in World War I. A copy of the report sent by ''City of Exeter'' was found, describing ''Atlantis'' in minute detail and including a photograph of the similar ''Freienfels'', confirming that the \"Japanese\" identity had not been believed. Rogge had his ship's profile altered, adding two new masts.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\nAt 10:09 on 13 July, ''Atlantis'' encountered a passenger liner, ''Kemmendine'', which was heading for Burma. The crew on the ''Kemmendine'' opened fire on ''Atlantis ''with a 3-inch gun mounted on ''Kemmendine'''s stern. ''Atlantis ''returned fire, and ''Kemmendine'' was quickly ablaze. All the passengers and crew were taken off ''Kemmendine'', and ''Kemmendine ''was then sunk.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|16}}\n\n===''Talleyrand'' and ''King City''===\nIn August, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Talleyrand'', the sister ship of ''Tirranna''. Then she encountered ''[[King City (naval vessel)|King City]]'', carrying coal, which was mistaken for a British [[Q-Ship]] due to its erratic maneuvering caused by mechanical difficulties. Three shells from ''Atlantis'' destroyed ''King City'''s bridge, killing four merchant cadets and a cabin boy. Another wounded sailor later died on the operating table aboard ''Atlantis''.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|18}}\n\n===''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', ''Commissaire Ramel'', ''Durmitor'', ''Teddy'', and ''Ole Jacob''===\nIn September, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', and {{SS|Commissaire Ramel||2}}. All of these were sunk only after supplies, documents, and POWs were taken. In October, the Germans took the [[Yugoslavia]]n steamboat ''Durmitor'', loaded with a cargo of salt. Yugoslavia was neutral at the time, but Captain Rogge was desperate for an opportunity for ''Atlantis'' to get rid of the POWs that had accumulated on board, so the ship was captured because it had been carrying coal from [[Cardiff]] to [[Oran]] before its current voyage.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|19}}  Captured documents and 260 POWs were transferred to ''Durmitor'', which, with a prize crew of 14 Germans commanded by Lt.

On both occasions, ''Atlantis'' presented itself as [[SS Antenor (1924)|HMS ''Antenor'']].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|pp=134\u2013137}}.</ref>\n\n===''Automedon'' and her secret cargo===\n{{Main|SS Automedon}}\nAt about 07:00 on 11 November 1940, ''Atlantis'' encountered the [[Blue Funnel Line]] cargo ship ''Automedon'' about {{convert|250|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Sumatra]]. At 08:20, ''Atlantis'' fired a warning shot across ''Automedon'''s bow, and her radio operator at once began transmitting a distress call of \"RRRR \u2013 Automedon \u2013 0416N\" (\"RRRR\" meant \"under attack by armed raider<ref name=\"Turner22\"/>\").\n\nAt a range of around {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, ''Atlantis'' shelled ''Automedon'', ceasing fire after three minutes in which she had destroyed her bridge, accommodation, and lifeboats. Six crew members were killed and twelve injured.\n\nThe Germans boarded the stricken ship and broke into the strong room, where they found fifteen bags of [[Top Secret]] mail for the [[British Far East Command]], including a large quantity of decoding tables, fleet orders, gunnery instructions, and naval intelligence reports. After wasting an hour breaking open the ship's safe only to discover \"a few shillings in cash\", a search of the ''Automedon'''s chart room found a small weighted green bag marked \"Highly Confidential\" containing the Chief of Staff's report to the Commander in Chief Far East, [[Robert Brooke Popham]]. The bag was supposed to be thrown overboard if there was risk of loss, but the personnel responsible for this had been killed or incapacitated. The report contained the latest assessment of the Japanese Empire's military strength in the Far East, along with details of [[Royal Air Force]] units, naval strength, and notes on [[Singapore]]'s defences. It painted a gloomy picture of British land and naval capabilities in the Far East, and declared that Britain was too weak to risk war with Japan.<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|117}}\n\n''Automedon'' was sunk at 15:07. Rogge soon realised the importance of the intelligence material he had captured and quickly transferred the documents to the recently acquired prize vessel ''Ole Jacob'', ordering Lieutenant Commander Paul Kamenz and six of his crew to take charge of the vessel. After an uneventful voyage they arrived in [[Kobe]], Japan, on 4 December 1940.\n\nThe mail reached the German Embassy in Tokyo on 5 December. The German Naval attach\u00e9 [[Paul Wenneker]] had the summary of the British plan wired to Berlin, while the original was hand-carried by Kamenz to Berlin via the [[Trans-Siberian railway]]. A copy was given to the Japanese, to whom it provided valuable intelligence prior to their [[Pacific War#Japan attacks the Western Powers|commencing hostilities against the Western Powers]]. Rogge was rewarded for this with an ornate [[katana]]; the only other Germans so honoured were [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]].{{citation required|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter reading the captured Chief of Staff report, on 7 January 1941 Japanese [[Admiral Yamamoto]] wrote to the Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch forces would be suitably weakened for the Japanese to deliver a death blow; the ''Automedon'' intelligence on the weakness of the [[British Empire]] is thus credibly linked with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the attack leading to the [[fall of Singapore]].<ref>Seki, Eiji.

He was buried in what is sometimes referred to as \"the southernmost of all German war graves\".<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|134}}\n\nIn late January 1941, off the eastern coast of Africa, ''Atlantis'' sank the British ship ''Mandasor'' and captured ''[[Doggerbank (ship)|Speybank]]''. Then, on 2 February, the Norwegian tanker ''Ketty Br\u00f8vig'' was relieved of her fuel. The fuel was used not only for the German raider, but also to refuel the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|German cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'']] and, on 29 March the Italian submarine ''[[Italian submarine Perla|Perla]]''. ''Perla'' was making its way from the port of [[Massawa]] in [[Italian East Africa]], around the Cape of Good Hope, to [[Bordeaux]] in France. Rogge wrote in his memoirs that, after seeing the small coastal submarine and its emaciated crew, he told the commander, Lt. Bruno Napp, his perplexity about his mission and suggested him to reach either Brazil or Argentina to be interned; by his account, Napp politely rejected the advice, telling that he would do his utmost to obey his orders, much to Rogge's admiration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giorgerini|first1=Giorgio|title=Uomini sul fondo : storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi|date=2002|publisher=Mondadori|location=Milano|isbn=8804505370|pages=413\u20134}}</ref>\n\n===''Zamzam''===\nBy April, ''Atlantis'' had returned to the Atlantic where, on April 17, Rogge, mistaking the [[Egypt]]ian liner ''[[Zamzam_(ship)|Zamzam]] '' for a British liner being used as a troop carrier or Q-ship\u2014as she was in fact the former [[Bibby Line]]r ''Leicestershire''\u2014opened fire at a range of {{convert|8.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

''Atlantis'' was second only to {{Ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} in tonnage destroyed, and had the longest raiding career of any German commerce raider in either world war. She captured highly secret documents from {{SS|Automedon}}. A version of the story of ''Atlantis'' is told in the film ''[[Under Ten Flags]]'' with [[Van Heflin]] appearing as Captain Rogge.\n\n==Early history==\nBuilt by [[Bremer Vulkan]] in 1937,<ref name=mohr/> she began her career as the [[cargo ship]] ''Goldenfels'', owned and operated by [[DDG Hansa]], [[Bremen]].

She had a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] amidships. She had a crew of 349 (21 officers and 328 enlisted sailors) and a [[Scottish terrier]], Ferry, as mascot. The cruiser carried a dummy funnel and variable-height masts, and was well supplied with paint, canvas, and materials for further altering her appearance, including costumes for the crew and flags. ''Atlantis'' was capable of being modified to twenty-six different silhouettes.\n\n===Weapons and aircraft===\nThe ship was equipped with six {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, one {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun on the bow, two twin-37&nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and four [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm automatic cannon]]s; all of these were hidden, mostly behind pivotable false deck or side structures.

Commissioned in mid-December, she was the first of nine or ten merchant ships armed by the [[Third Reich]] for the purposes of seeking out and engaging enemy cargo vessels. ''Atlantis'' was delayed by ice until 31 March 1940,<ref name=\"Turner22\">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=L.C.F.|title=War in the Southern Oceans: 1939\u201345|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=22}}</ref> when the former [[battleship]] {{ship|SMS|Hessen||2}} was sent to act as an [[icebreaker]], clearing the way for ''Atlantis'', ''Orion'', and ''Widder''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

By this time, ''Atlantis'' was pretending to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vessel named ''Kim'' by flying the Soviet naval ensign, displaying a hammer and sickle on the bridge, and having Russian and English warnings on the stern, \"Keep clear of propellers\". The Soviet Union was neutral at the time.\n\nAfter crossing the equator, on 24\u201325 April, she took the guise of the Japanese vessel ''Kasii Maru''. The ship now displayed a large K upon a red-topped funnel, identification of the [[K Line]] transportation company. She also had rising sun symbols on the gun flaps and Japanese characters (copied from a magazine) on the aft hull.\n\n===''City of Exeter''===\nOn 2 May, she met the British passenger liner {{SS|City of Exeter}}. Rogge, unwilling to cause non-combatant casualties, declined to attack. Once the ships had parted, ''Exeter''{{'}}s Master radioed his suspicions about the \"Japanese\" ship to the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=bismarckclass>[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/hilfskreuzer/atlantis.html Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser / Raider) Atlantis \u2013 The History]</ref>\n\n===''Scientist''===\nOn 3 May, ''Atlantis'' met a British [[cargo ship]], ''Scientist'', which was carrying [[ore]] and [[jute]]. The Germans raised their [[battle ensign]] and displayed signal pennants stating, \"Stop or I fire! Don't use your radio!\" The {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun fired a warning shot. The British immediately began transmitting their alarm signal, \"QQQQ...QQQQ...Unidentified merchantman has ordered me to stop\", and the Germans began transmitting so as to jam the signals.\n\n''Scientist'' turned to flee, but on the second salvo from ''Atlantis'' flames exploded from the ship, followed by a cloud of dust and then white steam from the boilers. A British sailor was killed and the remaining 77 were taken as prisoners of war. After failing to sink the ship with demolition charges, ''Atlantis'' used guns and a torpedo to finish off ''Scientist''.\n\n===Cape Agulhas===\nContinuing to sail south, ''Atlantis'' passed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching [[Cape Agulhas]] on 10 May. Here she set up a minefield with 92 horned contact [[naval mine]]s, in a way which suggested that a U-boat had laid them. The minefield was successful, but the deception was foiled and the ship's presence revealed by a German [[propaganda]] [[broadcast]] boasting that \"a minefield, sown by a German raider\" had sunk no fewer than eight merchant ships, three more were overdue, three minesweepers were involved, and the Royal Navy was not capable of finding \"a solitary raider\" operating in \"its own back yard\". Furthermore, a British signal was sent from Ceylon on 20 May and intercepted by Germany, based on the report from ''City of Exeter'', warning shipping of a German raider disguised as a Japanese ship.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n''Atlantis'' headed into the [[Indian Ocean]] disguised as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] vessel MV ''Abbekerk''. She received a broadcast\u2014which happened to be incorrect\u2014reporting that ''Abbekerk'' had been sunk, but retained that identity rather than repainting, as there were several similar Dutch vessels.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n===''Tirranna'', ''City of Baghdad'', and the ''Kemmendine''===\n[[File:Tirranna (ship).tif|thumb|''Tirranna''<ref>[https://viewer.slv.vic.gov.au/?entity=IE916003&mode=browse ''Tirranna''], State Library of Victoria.

Filled with supplies for Australian troops in the Middle East, ''Tirranna'' was captured and sent to France.\n\nOn 11 July, the liner ''City of Baghdad'' was fired upon at a range of {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A boarding party discovered a copy of ''[[Broadcasting for Allied Merchant Ships]]'', which contained communications codes. ''City of Baghdad'', like ''Atlantis'', was a former [[DDG Hansa]] ship, having been captured by the British in World War I. A copy of the report sent by ''City of Exeter'' was found, describing ''Atlantis'' in minute detail and including a photograph of the similar ''Freienfels'', confirming that the \"Japanese\" identity had not been believed. Rogge had his ship's profile altered, adding two new masts.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\nAt 10:09 on 13 July, ''Atlantis'' encountered a passenger liner, ''Kemmendine'', which was heading for Burma. The crew on the ''Kemmendine'' opened fire on ''Atlantis ''with a 3-inch gun mounted on ''Kemmendine'''s stern. ''Atlantis ''returned fire, and ''Kemmendine'' was quickly ablaze. All the passengers and crew were taken off ''Kemmendine'', and ''Kemmendine ''was then sunk.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|16}}\n\n===''Talleyrand'' and ''King City''===\nIn August, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Talleyrand'', the sister ship of ''Tirranna''. Then she encountered ''[[King City (naval vessel)|King City]]'', carrying coal, which was mistaken for a British [[Q-Ship]] due to its erratic maneuvering caused by mechanical difficulties. Three shells from ''Atlantis'' destroyed ''King City'''s bridge, killing four merchant cadets and a cabin boy. Another wounded sailor later died on the operating table aboard ''Atlantis''.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|18}}\n\n===''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', ''Commissaire Ramel'', ''Durmitor'', ''Teddy'', and ''Ole Jacob''===\nIn September, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', and {{SS|Commissaire Ramel||2}}. All of these were sunk only after supplies, documents, and POWs were taken. In October, the Germans took the [[Yugoslavia]]n steamboat ''Durmitor'', loaded with a cargo of salt. Yugoslavia was neutral at the time, but Captain Rogge was desperate for an opportunity for ''Atlantis'' to get rid of the POWs that had accumulated on board, so the ship was captured because it had been carrying coal from [[Cardiff]] to [[Oran]] before its current voyage.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|19}}  Captured documents and 260 POWs were transferred to ''Durmitor'', which, with a prize crew of 14 Germans commanded by Lt. Dehnel, was dispatched to Italian-controlled [[Mogadishu]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}</ref> Lacking sufficient fuel, the ''Durmitor'' resorted to sails and, after a \"hellish\" voyage, made landfall in [[Warsheikh]], north of Mogadishu, on 22 November, five weeks after departure.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=130}}.

On both occasions, ''Atlantis'' presented itself as [[SS Antenor (1924)|HMS ''Antenor'']].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|pp=134\u2013137}}.</ref>\n\n===''Automedon'' and her secret cargo===\n{{Main|SS Automedon}}\nAt about 07:00 on 11 November 1940, ''Atlantis'' encountered the [[Blue Funnel Line]] cargo ship ''Automedon'' about {{convert|250|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Sumatra]]. At 08:20, ''Atlantis'' fired a warning shot across ''Automedon'''s bow, and her radio operator at once began transmitting a distress call of \"RRRR \u2013 Automedon \u2013 0416N\" (\"RRRR\" meant \"under attack by armed raider<ref name=\"Turner22\"/>\").\n\nAt a range of around {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, ''Atlantis'' shelled ''Automedon'', ceasing fire after three minutes in which she had destroyed her bridge, accommodation, and lifeboats. Six crew members were killed and twelve injured.\n\nThe Germans boarded the stricken ship and broke into the strong room, where they found fifteen bags of [[Top Secret]] mail for the [[British Far East Command]], including a large quantity of decoding tables, fleet orders, gunnery instructions, and naval intelligence reports. After wasting an hour breaking open the ship's safe only to discover \"a few shillings in cash\", a search of the ''Automedon'''s chart room found a small weighted green bag marked \"Highly Confidential\" containing the Chief of Staff's report to the Commander in Chief Far East, [[Robert Brooke Popham]]. The bag was supposed to be thrown overboard if there was risk of loss, but the personnel responsible for this had been killed or incapacitated. The report contained the latest assessment of the Japanese Empire's military strength in the Far East, along with details of [[Royal Air Force]] units, naval strength, and notes on [[Singapore]]'s defences. It painted a gloomy picture of British land and naval capabilities in the Far East, and declared that Britain was too weak to risk war with Japan.<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|117}}\n\n''Automedon'' was sunk at 15:07. Rogge soon realised the importance of the intelligence material he had captured and quickly transferred the documents to the recently acquired prize vessel ''Ole Jacob'', ordering Lieutenant Commander Paul Kamenz and six of his crew to take charge of the vessel. After an uneventful voyage they arrived in [[Kobe]], Japan, on 4 December 1940.\n\nThe mail reached the German Embassy in Tokyo on 5 December. The German Naval attach\u00e9 [[Paul Wenneker]] had the summary of the British plan wired to Berlin, while the original was hand-carried by Kamenz to Berlin via the [[Trans-Siberian railway]]. A copy was given to the Japanese, to whom it provided valuable intelligence prior to their [[Pacific War#Japan attacks the Western Powers|commencing hostilities against the Western Powers]]. Rogge was rewarded for this with an ornate [[katana]]; the only other Germans so honoured were [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]].{{citation required|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter reading the captured Chief of Staff report, on 7 January 1941 Japanese [[Admiral Yamamoto]] wrote to the Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch forces would be suitably weakened for the Japanese to deliver a death blow; the ''Automedon'' intelligence on the weakness of the [[British Empire]] is thus credibly linked with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the attack leading to the [[fall of Singapore]].<ref>Seki, Eiji.

He was buried in what is sometimes referred to as \"the southernmost of all German war graves\".<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|134}}\n\nIn late January 1941, off the eastern coast of Africa, ''Atlantis'' sank the British ship ''Mandasor'' and captured ''[[Doggerbank (ship)|Speybank]]''. Then, on 2 February, the Norwegian tanker ''Ketty Br\u00f8vig'' was relieved of her fuel. The fuel was used not only for the German raider, but also to refuel the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|German cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'']] and, on 29 March the Italian submarine ''[[Italian submarine Perla|Perla]]''. ''Perla'' was making its way from the port of [[Massawa]] in [[Italian East Africa]], around the Cape of Good Hope, to [[Bordeaux]] in France. Rogge wrote in his memoirs that, after seeing the small coastal submarine and its emaciated crew, he told the commander, Lt. Bruno Napp, his perplexity about his mission and suggested him to reach either Brazil or Argentina to be interned; by his account, Napp politely rejected the advice, telling that he would do his utmost to obey his orders, much to Rogge's admiration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giorgerini|first1=Giorgio|title=Uomini sul fondo : storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi|date=2002|publisher=Mondadori|location=Milano|isbn=8804505370|pages=413\u20134}}</ref>\n\n===''Zamzam''===\nBy April, ''Atlantis'' had returned to the Atlantic where, on April 17, Rogge, mistaking the [[Egypt]]ian liner ''Zamzam '' for a British liner being used as a troop carrier or Q-ship\u2014as she was in fact the former [[Bibby Line]]r ''Leicestershire''\u2014opened fire at a range of {{convert|8.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The resource of the shared country code consists of a ''country code'' and a ''group identification code'' (CC + GIC) and provides the capability for a group of countries to provide telecommunication services within the group. The Secretariat of the ITU Standardization Sector ([[ITU-T]]), the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) is responsible for the assignment of the CC + GIC.\n\n==DNS mapping of E.164 numbers==\n{{main|Telephone number mapping}}\nSome national telephone administrations and telephone companies have implemented an [[Internet]]-based database for their numbering spaces.  E.164 numbers may be used in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) of the [[Internet]] in which the second-level domain e164.arpa has been reserved for [[telephone number mapping]] (ENUM). In the system, any phone number may be mapped into a [[domain name]] using a reverse sequence of subdomains for each digit. For example, the telephone number {{gaps|+1|999|555|0123}} translates to the domain name 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.9.9.9.1.e164.arpa.\n\nWhen a number is mapped, a DNS query may be used to locate the service facilities on the Internet that accept and process telephone calls to the owner of record of the number, using, for example, the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), a call-signaling [[VoIP]] protocol whose [[SIP address]]es are similar in format (user@domain...) to e-mail addresses.\n\nThis allows a direct, end-to-end Internet connection without passing to the public switched telephone network (and back) and without incurring PSTN tolls.\n\nAs this is effectively a free call, there is little incentive for carriers to promote e164 DNS service. The e164.arpa domain is in production status {{asof|2013|lc=on}} only in a few European nations ([[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enumdata.org|title=RIPE ENUM Working Group: Progress Matrix|publisher=Enumdata.org|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref> [[Australia]] conducted a trial in 2007, but then abandoned further support of <tt>.1.6.e164.arpa</tt>.

The resource of the shared country code consists of a ''country code'' and a ''group identification code'' (CC + GIC) and provides the capability for a group of countries to provide telecommunication services within the group. The Secretariat of the ITU Standardization Sector ([[ITU-T]]), the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) is responsible for the assignment of the CC + GIC.\n\n==DNS mapping of E.164 numbers==\n{{main|Telephone number mapping}}\nSome national telephone administrations and telephone companies have implemented an [[Internet]]-based database for their numbering spaces.  E.164 numbers may be used in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) of the [[Internet]] in which the second-level domain e164.arpa has been reserved for [[telephone number mapping]] (ENUM). In the system, any phone number may be mapped into a [[domain name]] using a reverse sequence of subdomains for each digit. For example, the telephone number {{gaps|+1|999|555|0123}} translates to the domain name 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.9.9.9.1.e164.arpa.\n\nWhen a number is mapped, a DNS query may be used to locate the service facilities on the Internet that accept and process telephone calls to the owner of record of the number, using, for example, the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), a call-signaling [[VoIP]] protocol whose [[SIP address]]es are similar in format (user@domain...) to e-mail addresses.\n\nThis allows a direct, end-to-end Internet connection without passing to the public switched telephone network (and back) and without incurring PSTN tolls.\n\nAs this is effectively a free call, there is little incentive for carriers to promote e164 DNS service. The e164.arpa domain is in production status {{asof|2013|lc=on}} only in a few European nations ([[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enumdata.org|title=RIPE ENUM Working Group: Progress Matrix|publisher=Enumdata.org|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref> [[Australia]] conducted a trial in 2007, but then abandoned further support of <tt>.1.6.e164.arpa</tt>.

Unknown to them, Phillip has hacked Oliver too and knows what they are up to. When Oliver disappears for a short while, Connor panics thinking he is kidnapped. Oliver returns and says Phillip just wanted to talk, while showing a straw he snuck from Phillips for a DNA test. Connor, desperate to keep himself and Oliver away from Annalise and all the murder cases, applies to [[Stanford Law School]] and asks Oliver to move away with him, in \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)#ep12|It's a Trap]]\". In the final episode of second season, \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)#ep15|Anna Mae]]\", Oliver deletes Connor's Stanford acceptance email, calls the Dean of Students to decline his spot and hacks their system to re-route all calls to him.\n\nIn the third season premiere, \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep1|We're Good People Now]]\", Connor asks Annalise to refuse Oliver a job that he is going to ask, saying it would ruin him. Annalise agrees and gives her word that she won't hire him. But Oliver reveals to her about Connor's Stanford email and says he can hack her too to check for security vulnerabilities. Annalise, afraid that Oliver would find out about Sam, hires him as a technical expert. With no other option, Connor agrees with Annalise. Later, when he apologizes to Oliver for not taking his feelings into account before applying to Stanford, Oliver feels this is not how healthy relationships work and that he should have been angry instead of apologizing. This leads to Oliver breaking up with Connor. After Connor wins his first pro bono case, in \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep2|There Are Worse Things Than Murder]]\", Connor kisses Oliver and asks to be back together but Oliver doesn't agree. Heartbroken, Connor packs up and leaves Oliver's apartment to stay at Michaela's for a while.

Oliver gets drunk and goes back to Connor where they confess that they miss each other, leading them to have sex and being back together.

Connor, once again hurt and heartbroken, goes back to Michaela's apartment and cries saying \"I hate him! I hate him so much!\", breaking a glass table in anger.\n\nIn \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep9|Who's Dead?]]\", Oliver tries to apologize to Connor on multiple occasions but Connor blows him off each time.

After Annalise's house burns down and Connor is unreachable, Oliver fears the worst but is relieved when Connor shows up at the hospital. In the later episodes, it's shown that Connor was at the house before it burned down and that he had seen, tried to revive Wes but failed. When everyone suspects Connor of lying, Oliver defends him and stands by him. Oliver, now aware of all the murders, tries to be understanding of how Connor handled everything alone while he can't bring himself to go by his usual way.

Then Connor propose him and told that he is happy because of Oliver. Then Oliver told he's been lying to Connor because he knows who killed Wes.

You're everything to me\". Then later on the episode Oliver sings to Connor song [[All of Me (John Legend song)|All of Me]] by [[John Legend]].      \n\n=== Friendship ===\nConnor spends most of his time with the Keating 5 and Oliver, his husband. It is shown that he is closest with Michaela ([[Aja Naomi King]]). After learning about Connor applying for Stanford, Michaela asks him to stay back saying \"I can't survive here without you\". She also lets Connor crash at her place after Oliver breaks up with him and defends him after learning about Connor's role on the night Wes was murdered, even though Asher ([[Matt McGorry]]) and [[Laurel Castillo|Laurel]] ([[Karla Souza]]) don't believe him at all.\n\nNot the best friendship and not shown openly, Connor had a cordial relationship with Wes ([[Alfred Enoch]]). In \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep10|We're Bad People]]\", Connor revealed to Wes that he was going to therapy nowadays like he did when he was 17 and was struggling with [[Coming out|coming-out]] issues, and jokes that except this time he talks about the murders.

Asher punches Connor but later they forgive each other. Asher has always been a supportive friend to Connor and likewise Connor too helped Asher after his father died, even though his intentions weren't entirely pure at that time.\n\nIn \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep14|He Made a Terrible Mistake]]\", after learning about Connor's role on the night Wes was murdered, [[Laurel Castillo|Laurel]] goes on a rant against him saying he's lying, he's the reason Wes died, and that, he should take a gun and kill himself, unaware that Connor is already struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n\nConnor has a \"bratty\" relationship with Annalise and makes it clear, more often than not, that he doesn't trust her. When Annalise confronts Connor about Wes' death, Connor has an outburst where he says hurtful things after she calls him \"paranoid and broken\" and someone who's afraid to live alone and trust anyone since he was a child. Annalise understands Connor and asks the group to forgive him, saying he might kill himself if they didn't, thus making it clear that she knows about Connor's suicidal thoughts. She has also referred few times to herself saying she and Connor are \"worriers\" and are similar in nature.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe character as well as Falahee's acting have been well received by both fans and critics of the series.

Oliver returns and says Phillip just wanted to talk, while showing a straw he snuck from Phillips for a DNA test. Connor, desperate to keep himself and Oliver away from Annalise and all the murder cases, applies to [[Stanford Law School]] and asks Oliver to move away with him, in \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)#ep12|It's a Trap]]\". In the final episode of second season, \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)#ep15|Anna Mae]]\", Oliver deletes Connor's Stanford acceptance email, calls the Dean of Students to decline his spot and hacks their system to re-route all calls to him.\n\nIn the third season premiere, \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep1|We're Good People Now]]\", Connor asks Annalise to refuse Oliver a job that he is going to ask, saying it would ruin him. Annalise agrees and gives her word that she won't hire him. But Oliver reveals to her about Connor's Stanford email and says he can hack her too to check for security vulnerabilities. Annalise, afraid that Oliver would find out about Sam, hires him as a technical expert. With no other option, Connor agrees with Annalise. Later, when he apologizes to Oliver for not taking his feelings into account before applying to Stanford, Oliver feels this is not how healthy relationships work and that he should have been angry instead of apologizing. This leads to Oliver breaking up with Connor. After Connor wins his first pro bono case, in \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep2|There Are Worse Things Than Murder]]\", Connor kisses Oliver and asks to be back together but Oliver doesn't agree. Heartbroken, Connor packs up and leaves Oliver's apartment to stay at Michaela's for a while. Connor goes back to his usual sex escapades with guys from \"Humpr\" and doesn't make an effort to hide it. Oliver, though somewhat hurt, doesn't say anything to him. In \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep7|Call It Mother's Intuition]]\", Oliver goes on a date with a guy from the internet, named \"Thomas\" for which Connor confronts him asking why he said he needed to spend some time alone if he is going on dates with other guys. Even though Thomas expresses his interest in Oliver, he turns him down after learning Oliver is HIV positive. Oliver gets drunk and goes back to Connor where they confess that they miss each other, leading them to have sex and being back together. In \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep8|No More Blood]]\", Oliver keeps asking Connor about the things that he is hiding which leads to another argument where Oliver calls him \"emotionally damaged\". Connor, once again hurt and heartbroken, goes back to Michaela's apartment and cries saying \"I hate him! I hate him so much!\", breaking a glass table in anger.\n\nIn \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep9|Who's Dead?]]\", Oliver tries to apologize to Connor on multiple occasions but Connor blows him off each time. At a party sponsored by Annalise after the entire class cleared their midterms, Connor gets drunk and Oliver worries about him, reminding him about his drug problem. Connor, in his drunken state, confesses that he lied about being an addict and that he wasn't high that night (when Sam was murdered) but was traumatized. Later Oliver does his own research and correctly guesses that the Keating 5 had something to do with Sam's murder. After Annalise's house burns down and Connor is unreachable, Oliver fears the worst but is relieved when Connor shows up at the hospital. In the later episodes, it's shown that Connor was at the house before it burned down and that he had seen, tried to revive Wes but failed. When everyone suspects Connor of lying, Oliver defends him and stands by him. Oliver, now aware of all the murders, tries to be understanding of how Connor handled everything alone while he can't bring himself to go by his usual way. Connor admits this is why he didn't tell him anything and that he could still go to the police, make everything stop. In the final episode, \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep15|Wes]]\", after Connor is kidnapped and later freed from Denver by Annalise, Oliver proposes to Connor asking to marry him and \"make a million babies\". In the beginning of the season four Oliver hasn't get answer to the propose. Then Connor told him that he want to det married but not because Oliver is afraid that Connor is going to jail or someone is going to kill them. In episode [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 4)|Nobody Roots for Goliath]] Connor told Oliver that his dad told that he didn't think that Oliver would be the right guy for Connor. Then Connor propose him and told that he is happy because of Oliver. Then Oliver told he's been lying to Connor because he knows who killed Wes. Then Connor go straight to Laurel's and before Laurel opens door he says Oliver that give the ring back because he tought they were in a good place but because Oliver lied  to him. In episode [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 4)|Ask Him About Stella]] Connor says that he want go to law school again and says that it would be difficult with the school and planning the wedding. Then Asher asks \" Did you just... ?\". Which Connor says \" What do you say? You still want to marry me, Oli?\" and Oliver say \"You're the one that called if off\" and Connor answer to that \"Well, it's called back on\". In season five Oliver and Connor moves to another house because they wanted to save money for the wedding. Then Connor's and Oliver's mother's come to visit them before the wedding. Later Oliver told his mom about the HIV and then his mom told that \" I just hate that you felt you had to go through this all alone\" then Oliver says that \"I wasn't alone, I had Connor\". A few night's before the wedding in episode [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 5)|I Got Played]] Connor and Oliver had a meeting with a minister who marry them. The minister asks that \" Why you two wanna to get married?\" and Oliver answer that \" That's really simple. I wanna know and spent time with Connor for the rest of my life.\" and Connor answer to that \" Because he's the best thing that's ever happened to me.\" In later of the episode Connor says to Oliver that \" I will marry you in chruch for a million times as long as I can be with you.\" In episode [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 5)|I Want to Love You Until the Day I Die]] Oliver and Connor get married. Oliver says in his vow to Connor that \"My dream was you\". And Connor says to Oliver \" Because of you I want things I told myself I never did. I want to love you until the day I die. You're everything to me\". Then later on the episode Oliver sings to Connor song [[All of Me (John Legend song)|All of Me]] by [[John Legend]].      \n\n=== Friendship ===\nConnor spends most of his time with the Keating 5 and Oliver, his husband. It is shown that he is closest with Michaela ([[Aja Naomi King]]). After learning about Connor applying for Stanford, Michaela asks him to stay back saying \"I can't survive here without you\". She also lets Connor crash at her place after Oliver breaks up with him and defends him after learning about Connor's role on the night Wes was murdered, even though Asher ([[Matt McGorry]]) and [[Laurel Castillo|Laurel]] ([[Karla Souza]]) don't believe him at all.\n\nNot the best friendship and not shown openly, Connor had a cordial relationship with Wes ([[Alfred Enoch]]). In \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep10|We're Bad People]]\", Connor revealed to Wes that he was going to therapy nowadays like he did when he was 17 and was struggling with [[Coming out|coming-out]] issues, and jokes that except this time he talks about the murders. He clears it up that he talked about Oliver. After Wes died, Connor did not have kind words for him, which was him channeling his grief in a bad way, which lead Asher and [[Laurel Castillo|Laurel]] to dislike and suspect him. Asher punches Connor but later they forgive each other. Asher has always been a supportive friend to Connor and likewise Connor too helped Asher after his father died, even though his intentions weren't entirely pure at that time.\n\nIn \"[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)#ep14|He Made a Terrible Mistake]]\", after learning about Connor's role on the night Wes was murdered, [[Laurel Castillo|Laurel]] goes on a rant against him saying he's lying, he's the reason Wes died, and that, he should take a gun and kill himself, unaware that Connor is already struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n\nConnor has a \"bratty\" relationship with Annalise and makes it clear, more often than not, that he doesn't trust her. When Annalise confronts Connor about Wes' death, Connor has an outburst where he says hurtful things after she calls him \"paranoid and broken\" and someone who's afraid to live alone and trust anyone since he was a child. Annalise understands Connor and asks the group to forgive him, saying he might kill himself if they didn't, thus making it clear that she knows about Connor's suicidal thoughts. She has also referred few times to herself saying she and Connor are \"worriers\" and are similar in nature.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe character as well as Falahee's acting have been well received by both fans and critics of the series.
