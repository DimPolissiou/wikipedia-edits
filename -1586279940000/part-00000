Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}}{{sfn|C.

The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 5th century CE. The traditional accounts describe it as the last work of the third [[Sangam literature|Sangam]], but linguistic analysis suggests a later date of 450 to 500 CE and that it was composed after the Sangam period.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}\n\nThe Kural is traditionally praised with epithets and alternate titles such as \"the Tamil Veda\" and \"the divine book\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=}} It emphasizes [[ahimsa|non-violence]] and [[moral vegetarianism]] as virtues for an individual.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}{{sfn|Das|1997|pp=11-12}} In addition, it highlights truthfulness, self-restraint, gratitude, hospitality, kindness, goodness of wife, duty, giving, and so forth,{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=160\u2013163}} besides covering a wide range of social and political topics such as king, ministers, taxes, justice, forts, war, greatness of army and soldier's honor, death sentence for the wicked, agriculture, education, abstinence from alcohol and intoxicants.{{sfn|Hikosaka|Samuel|1990|p=200}}{{sfn|Ananthanathan, 1994|pp=151\u2013154}}{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=151-154}} It also includes chapters on friendship, love, sexual union, and domestic life.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=160\u2013163}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333\u20134334}}\n\nThe Kural has been widely admired by scholars and influential leaders over its history.{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} These include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], and [[Yu Hsi]]. The text has been translated into at least 40 Indian and non-Indian languages. The Kural is considered a masterpiece and one of the most important texts of the Tamil Literature.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} The Tamil people and the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] have long celebrated and upheld the text with reverence.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}}\n\n==Etymology and nomenclature==\n{{main|Glossary of names for the Tirukkural}}\nThe term ''Tirukkural'' is a compound word made of two individual terms, ''tiru'' and ''kural''. ''Tiru'' is an honorific Tamil term that corresponds to the universally Indian, Sanskrit term ''sri'' meaning \"holy, sacred, excellent, honorable, and beautiful.\"{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}} The term ''tiru'' has as many as 19 different meanings.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=vii}} ''Kural'' means something that is \"short, concise, and abridged.\"{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}} Etymologically, ''kural'' is the shortened form of ''kural paattu'', which is derived from ''kuruvenpaattu'', one of the two Tamil poetic forms explained by [[Tolkappiyam]], the other one being ''neduvenpaattu''.{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012a|pp=iv\u2013vi}} According to Winslow, ''kural'' is used as a literary term to indicate \"a metrical line of 2 feet, or a distich or couplet of short lines, the first of 4 and the second of 3 feet.\" Thus, ''Tirukkural'' literally comes to mean \"sacred couplets.\"{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}}\n\nThe work is highly cherished in the Tamil culture, as reflected by its nine different traditional titles: ''Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' (the sacred kural), ''Uttaravedam'' (the ultimate [[Veda]]), ''Thiruvalluvar'' (eponymous with the author), ''Poyyamoli'' (the falseless word), ''Vayurai valttu'' (truthful praise), ''Teyvanul'' (the divine book), ''Potumarai'' (the common Veda), ''Muppal'' (the three-fold path), and ''Tamilmarai'' (the Tamil Veda).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}\n\n== Date ==\n{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}\nThe Kural has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 5th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]], and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as [[Somasundara Bharathiar]] and M Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]], a [[Czechs|Czech]] scholar of Tamil literature, these early dates such as 300 BCE to 1 BCE are unacceptable and not supported by evidence within the text. The diction and grammar of the Kural, and Valluvar's indebtedness to some earlier Sanskrit sources, suggest that he lived after the \"early Tamil bardic poets\", but before Tamil bhakti poets era.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124 with footnotes}}\n\nIn 1959, [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to around or after the 6th century CE. His proposal is based on the evidence that the Kural text contains a large proportion of Sanskrit loan words, shows awareness and indebtedness to some Sanskrit texts best dated to the first half of the 1st millennium CE, and the grammatical innovations in the language of the Kural literature.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124 with footnotes}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Pillai published a list of 137 Sanskrit loan words in the Kural text.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=170-171}} Later scholars [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]] show that 35 of these are of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin and not Sanskrit loan words. Zvelebil states that an additional few have uncertain etymology and that future studies may prove those to be Dravidian.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=170-171}} The 102 remaining loan words from Sanskrit are \"not negligible\", and some of the teachings in the Kural text, according to Zvelebil, are \"undoubtedly\" based on the then extant Sanskrit works such as the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' and ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (also called the ''Manavadharmasastra'').{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=170-171}}\n\nIn his treatise of Tamil literary history published in 1974, Zvelebil states that the Kural text does not belong to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] period and dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} His estimate is based on the language of the text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared with these older texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the \"one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition\" as a few of the verses in the Kural text are \"undoubtedly\" translations of the verses of earlier Indian texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}\n\nIn the 19th century and the early 20th century, European writers and missionaries variously dated the text and its author to between 400 and 1000 CE.{{sfn|C. Blackburn, 2000|pp=454 with footnote 7}} According to Blackburn, the \"current scholarly consensus\" dates the text and the author to approximately 500 CE.{{sfn|C. Blackburn, 2000|pp=454 with footnote 7}}\n\n==Author==\n{{main|Thiruvalluvar}}\n{{Quote box|bgcolor = #E0E6F8|align=right|quote=<poem>\n\"The book without a name by an author without a name.\"\n</poem>\n|source=\u2014[[E.

No other authentic pre-colonial texts have been found to support any legends about the life of Valluvar. Starting around early 19th century, numerous inconsistent legends on Valluvar in various Indian languages and English were published.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}}\n\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue at Kanyakumari 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|The statue of Valluvar, the author of the Kural text, on an island in [[Kanyakumari]] facing towards the Tamil Nadu coastline]]\nVarious claims have been made regarding Valluvar's family background and occupation in the colonial era literature, all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} One traditional version claims that he was a [[Paraiyar]] weaver.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=124-125}} Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of [[Vellalar]]s because he extols agriculture in his work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} Another states he was an outcaste, born to a Pariah woman and a [[Brahmin]] father.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} [[M. Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]] speculated that \"valluva\" in his name is a variation of \"vallabha\", the designation of a royal officer.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] derived his name from \"valluvan\" (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was \"the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|pp=24\u201326}} The traditional biographies not only are inconsistent, but also contain incredulous claims about the author of the Kural text. Along with various versions of his birth circumstances, many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary [[Agastya]] and other sages.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} There are also accounts claiming that, during his return journey, Valluvar sat under a tree whose shadow sat still over him and did not move the entire day, he killed a demon, and many more.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical, a feature common to \"international and Indian folklore\". The alleged low birth, high birth and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=459-464}}\n\nThe Kural text is aphoristic and non-denominational in nature and can be selectively interpreted in many ways. This has led almost every major religious group in [[India]], including [[Christianity]], to claim the work and its author as one of their own.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} In a manner similar to speculations of the author's biography, there has been much speculation about his religion with no historical evidence. The 19th-century Christian missionary [[George Uglow Pope]], for example, claimed that Valluvar must have lived in the 9th century CE, come in contact with Christian teachers such as [[Pantaenus]] of [[Alexandria]], imbibed Christian ideas and peculiarities of Alexandrian teachers and then wrote the \"wonderful Kurral\" with an \"echo of the 'Sermon of the Mount'.\"{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} This theory is ahistorical and discredited.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=42}} According to Zvelebil, the ethics and ideas in Valluvar's work are not [[Christian ethics]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}}\n\nValluvar is thought to have belonged to either [[Jainism]] or [[Hinduism]]. This can be observed in his treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept of both the religions. In the 1819 translation, [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Valluvar was a Jain or Hindu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=463-464}} According to Zvelebil, Valluvar's treatment of the chapters on [[moral vegetarianism]]{{Ref label|A|a|none}} and [[non-killing]] reflects the Jain precepts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} Certain epithets for God and ascetic values found in the text are found in Jainism, states Zvelebil. He theorizes that Valluvar was probably \"a learned Jain with eclectic leanings\", who was well acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} Nevertheless, early [[Digambara]] or [[Svetambara]] Jaina texts do not mention Valluvar or the Kural text.

However, the subdivisions beyond these three, as found in some surviving manuscripts and commentaries, are likely later additions because there are variations between these subtitles found in manuscripts and those in historical commentaries.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013163}} For example, the following subdivisions are found in [[Parimelalhagar]]'s version, which greatly varies from that of [[Manakkudavar]]'s:{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\n* Chapters 1\u20134: Introduction\n* Chapters 5\u201324: Domestic virtue\n* Chapters 25\u201338: Ascetic virtue\n* Chapters 39\u201363: Royalty, the qualities of the leader of men\n* Chapters 64\u201373: The subject and the ruler\n* Chapters 74\u201396: Essential parts of state, shrewdness in public life\n* Chapters 97\u2013108: Reaching perfection in social life\n* Chapters 109\u2013115: Concealed love\n* Chapters 116\u2013133: Wedded love\n\nSuch subdivisions are likely later additions, but the couplets themselves have been preserved in the original form and there is no evidence of later revisions or insertions into the couplets.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013160}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nAccording to Zvelebil, the content of the Kural text is \"undoubtedly patterned\" and \"very carefully structured\".{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=163}} There are no structural gaps in the text, with every couplet indispensable for the structured whole. There are two distinct meanings for every couplet, namely, a structural one and a proverbial one. In their isolated form, that is, when removed from the context of the 10-couplet chapter, the couplets lose their structural meaning but retain the \"wise saying, moral maxim\" sense. In isolation, a couplet is \"a perfect form, possessing, in varying degree, the prosodic and rhetoric qualities of gnomic poetry.\"{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013163}} Within the chapter-structure, the couplets acquire their structural meaning and reveal the more complete teaching of the author. This, Zvelebil states, is the higher pattern in the Kural text, and finally, in relation to the entire work, they acquire perfection in the totality of their structure.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013163}} In terms of structural flow, the text journeys the reader from \"the imperfect, incomplete\" state of man implicit in the early chapters to the \"physically, morally, intellectually and emotionally perfect\" state of man living as a husband and citizen, states Zvelebil.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=159}}\n\nIn poetic terms, it fuses verse and aphoristic form in diction in a \"pithy, vigorous, forceful and terse\" manner. It is an ethics text that expounds a universal, moral and practical approach to life. Throughout the work, Valluvar is more considerate about the substance than the linguistic appeal of his writing.{{sfn|Mahadevan, 1985|p=187}}\n\n===Substance===\nThe text was written for its time, for the then contemporary society. It is marked by [[pragmatic idealism]],{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4333}} focused on \"man in the totality of his relationships\".{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4341}} According to Zvelebil, the Kural text does not feature \"true and great poetry\" throughout the work, except, notably, in the [[Inbam (Kural book)|third book]], which deals with love and pleasure. This emphasis on substance rather than poetry suggests that Valluvar's main aim was not to produce a work of art, but rather an instructive text focused on wisdom, justice, and ethics.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=168}}\n\nThe Kural text begins with an invocation of God and then praises the rain for being the vitalizer of all life forms on earth. It proceeds to describe the qualities of a righteous person, before concluding the introduction by emphasizing the value of ''a\u1e5fam'' or virtue.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}} Valluvar extols rain next only to God for it provides food and serves as the basis of a stable economic life by aiding in agriculture, which Valluvar asserts as the most important economic activity later in Book II of the Kural text.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=27}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote=\"The greatest virtue of all is non-killing; truthfulness cometh only next.\"|salign=right|source=(Kural 323; [[V.

Nagarajan|2005|pp=124-130}} Of the three books of the Kural literature, the second one on politics and kingdom (''poru\u1e37'') is about twice the size of the first, and three times that of the third.{{sfn|Ananthanathan, 1994|p=316}} In the 700 couplets on ''poru\u1e37'' (53 percent of the text), Valluvar mostly discusses statecraft and warfare.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=152-154, 144-151}}\n\nThe greatest of personal virtues according to the Kural text is [[non-killing]], followed by [[veracity (ethics)|veracity]],{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4341\u20134342}}{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34\u201336}} and the two greatest sins that Valluvar feels very strongly are ingratitude and [[meat-eating]].{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|p=13}}{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=162\u2013163}} In the words of [[Gopalkrishna Gandhi]], Valluvar maintains his views on personal morality even in the Book of Love, where one can normally expect greater poetic leniency, by describing the hero as \"a one-woman man\" without concubines.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} In a social and political context, the Kural text glorifies valour and victory during war and recommends a death sentence for the wicked only as a means of justice.{{sfn|Das|1997|pp=11-12}}{{sfn|K.V. Nagarajan|2005|pp=125-127}}{{sfn|Subramaniam|1963|pp=162-174}}\n\nAccording to Kaushik Roy, the Kural text in substance is a classic on realism and pragmatism, and it is not a mystic, purely philosophical document.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=152-154, 144-151}} Valluvar presents his theory of state using six elements: army (''patai''), subjects (''kuti''), treasure (''kul''), ministers (''amaiccu''), allies (''natpu''), and forts (''aran'').{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=152-154, 144-151}} Valluvar also recommends forts and other infrastructure, supplies and food storage in preparation for siege.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=152-154, 144-151}}<ref>{{cite book|author=P.

The text supports death penalty for the wicked, though in the ''a\u1e5fam'' book it also emphasizes the personal virtue of non-killing.{{sfn|K.V. Nagarajan|2005|pp=124-125}} The Kural cautions against tyranny, appeasement and oppression, with the suggestion that such royal behavior causes natural disasters, depletes the state's wealth and ultimately results in the loss of power and prosperity.{{sfn|K.V. Nagarajan|2005|pp=124-126}}\n\n===Similes and contradictions===\nThe author seldom shows any concern as to what [[similes]] and [[superlatives]] he used earlier while writing on other subjects, purposely allowing for some repetition and mild contradictions in ideas one can find in the Kural text. Despite knowing its seemingly contradictory nature from a purist point of view, Valluvar employs this method to emphasise the importance of the given code of ethic. Following are some of the instances where Valluvar employs contradictions to expound the virtues.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n* While in Chapter 93 Valluvar writes on the evils of intoxication, in Chapter 109 he uses the same to show the sweetness of love by saying love is sweeter than wine.\n* To the question \"What is wealth of all wealth?\" Valluvar points out to two different things, namely, grace (Kural 241) and hearing (Kural 411).\n* In regard to the virtues one should follow dearly even at the expense of other virtues, Valluvar points to veracity (Kural 297), not coveting another's wife (Kural 150), and not being called a slanderer (Kural 181). In essence, however, in Chapter 33 he crowns non-killing as the foremost of all virtues, pushing even the virtue of veracity to the second place (Kural 323).\n* Whereas he says that one can eject what is natural or inborn in him (Kural 376), he indicates that one can overcome the inherent natural flaws by getting rid of laziness (Kural 609).\n* While in Chapter 7 he asserts that the greatest gain men can obtain is by their learned children (Kural 61), in Chapter 13 he says that it is that which is obtained by self-control (Kural 122).\n\n==Commentaries and translations==\n{{main|Translations of Tirukkural|List of Tirukkural translations by language|Tirukkural translations into English}}\n\n===Commentaries===\n[[File:Tirukkural manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Palm leaf manuscript of the Tirukkural]]\nThe Kural is one of the most reviewed of all works in [[Tamil literature]], and almost every notable scholar has written commentaries (explanation in prose or verse) on it.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{Ref label|F|f|none}} Some of the Tamil literature that was composed after the Kural quote or borrow its couplets in their own texts.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=337-338}} According to Aravindan, these texts may be considered as the early commentaries to the Kural text.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}\n\nDedicated commentaries on the Kural text appear about and after the 10th century CE. There were at least ten medieval commentaries of which only six have survived into the modern era. The [[Ten Medieval Commentators|ten medieval commentators]] include [[Manakkudavar]], [[Dharumar]], [[Dhamatthar]], [[Nacchar]], [[Paridhi]]yar, [[Thirumalaiyar]], [[Mallar (poet)|Mallar]], [[Pari Perumal]], [[Kaalingar]], and [[Parimelalhagar]], all of whom lived between the 10th and the 13th centuries CE. Of these, only the works of Manakkudavar, Paridhi, Kaalingar, Pari Perumal, and Parimelalhagar are available today. The works of Dharumar, Dhaamatthar, and Nacchar are only partially available. The commentaries by Thirumalaiyar and Mallar are lost completely. The best known among these are the commentaries by Parimelalhagar, Kaalingar, and Manakkudavar.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333\u20134334}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|p=2}} Among the ten medieval commentaries, scholars have found spelling, homophonic, and other minor textual variations in a total of 900 couplets, including 217 couplets in Book I, 487 couplets in Book II, and 196 couplets in Book III.{{sfn|Perunchithiranar, 1933|p=259}}\n\nThe best known and influential historic commentary on the Kural text is the ''Parimelalhakiyar virutti''. It was written by [[Parimelalhagar]] \u2013 a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Brahmin, likely based in [[Kanchipuram]], who lived about or before 1272 CE based on an inscription discovered in a Hindu temple dedicated to [[Vishnu|Varadaraja]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=126 with footnotes}} Along with the Kural text, this commentary has been widely published and is in itself a Tamil classic.{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=558-561, 563}} Parimelalhagar's commentary has survived over the centuries in many folk and scholarly versions. A more scholarly version of this commentary was published by Krisnamachariyar in 1965.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=126 with footnotes}} According to Norman Cutler, Parimelalhagar's commentary interprets and maneuvers the Kural text within his own context, grounded in the concepts and theological premises of Hinduism. His commentary closely follows the Kural's teachings, while reflecting both the cultural values and textual values of the 13th- and 14th-century Tamil Nadu. Valluvar's text can be interpreted and maneuvered in other ways, states Cutler.{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=558-561, 563}}\n\nBesides the ten medieval commentaries, there are at least three more commentaries written by unknown authors.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} One of them was published under the title \"Palhaiya Urai\" (meaning ancient commentary), while the second one was based on Paridhiyar's commentary.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} The third one was published in 1991 under the title \"Jaina Urai\" (meaning Jaina commentary) by [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]] in [[Thanjavur]].{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|p=129}} Following these medieval commentaries, there are at least 21 [[venpa]] commentaries to the Kural, including Somesar Mudumoli Venba, Murugesar Muduneri Venba, Sivasiva Venba, Irangesa Venba, and Vadamalai Venba, all of which are considered commentaries in verse form.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=ix}}{{sfn|Iraikuruvanar, 2009|pp=53\u201359}}\n\nSeveral modern commentaries started appearing in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Graul also published the first German translation.<ref name=derkural/>]]\nThe Kural has been the most frequently translated ancient Tamil text. By 1975, its translations in at least 20 major languages had been published:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=126-127 with footnotes}}\n*Indian languages: Sanskrit, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu\n*Non-Indian languages: Burmese, Malay, Chinese, Fijian, Latin, French, German, Russian, Polish, Swedish, and English\n\nThe text was likely translated into Indian languages by Indian scholars over the centuries, but the palm leaf manuscripts of such translations have been rare. For example, S. R. Ranganathan,\u00a0a librarian of [[University of Madras]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]], discovered a Malayalam translation copied in year 777 of the Malayalam calendar, a manuscript that Zvelebil dates to late 16th century.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=127 with footnote 99}} The text was translated into several European languages during the colonial era, particularly by the [[Christian missionaries]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=28\u201347}}\n\nThe first European language translation ([[Latin]]) was published by [[Constanzo Beschi|Constantius Joseph Beschi]] in 1730. However, he translated only the first two books, viz., virtue and wealth, leaving out the book on love because its erotic and sexual nature was deemed by him to be inappropriate for a Christian missionary. The first [[French language|French]] translation was brought about by an unknown author by about 1767 that went unnoticed. The first available French version was by [[E. S. Ariel]] in 1848. Again, he did not translate the whole work but only parts of it. The first [[German language|German]] translation was made by [[Karl Graul]], who published it in 1856 both at [[London]] and [[Leipzig]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=30\u201331}}<ref name=derkural>[https://archive.org/details/dli.RTa2/page/n7 Der Kural des Tiruvalluver], Karl Graul (1856), Williams & Norgate</ref>\n\nThe first, and incomplete, [[English language|English]] translations were made by N. E. Kindersley in 1794 and then by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1812. While Kindersley translated a selection of the Kural text, Ellis translated 120 couplets in all\u201469 of them in verse and 51 in prose.{{sfn|S.

It contained the original Tamil text of the Kural, Parimelalhagar's commentary, Ramanuja Kavirayar's amplification of the commentary and Drew's English prose translation. However, Drew translated only 630 couplets, and the remaining were translated by [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]], a native missionary. Like Beschi, Drew did not translate the third book on love.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=31}} The first complete English translation of the Kural was the one by the Christian missionary [[George Uglow Pope]] in 1886, which introduced the complete Kural to the western world.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=32}}\n\nThe translations of the Kural in Southeast Asian and East Asian languages were published in the 20th century. A few of these relied on re-translating the earlier English translations of the work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=127 with footnote 99}}\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, there were about 24 translations of the Kural in English alone, by both native and non-native scholars, including those by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]], [[K. M. Balasubramaniam]], [[Shuddhananda Bharati]], [[A. Chakravarti]], [[M. S. Purnalingam Pillai]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[P. S. Sundaram]], [[V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar]], [[G. Vanmikanathan]], [[Kasturi Srinivasan]], [[S. N. Sriramadesikan]], and [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=36}} The work has also been translated into [[Vaagri Booli language|Vaagri Booli]], the language of the [[Narikurava]]s, a tribal community in Tamil Nadu, by Kittu Sironmani.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 25 March 2013}}\n\n===Difficulties and distortions===\nWith a highly compressed prosodic form, the Kural text employs the intricately complex ''[[Kural (poetic form)|Kural venba]]'' [[Poetic metre|metre]], known for its eminent suitability to gnomic poetry.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=166}} This form, which Zvelebil calls \"a marvel of brevity and condensation,\" is closely connected with the structural properties of the Tamil language and has historically presented extreme difficulties to its translators.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=167}} Talking about translating the Kural into other languages, [[Herbert Arthur Popley]] observes, \"it is impossible in any translation to do justice to the beauty and force of the original.\"{{sfn|Popley, 1931|p=x}} Zvelebil claims that it is impossible to truly appreciate the maxims found in the Kural couplets through a translation but rather that the Kural has to be read and understood in its original Tamil form.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}}\n\nBesides these inherent difficulties in translating the Kural, some scholars have attempted to either read their own ideas into the Kural couplets or deliberately misinterpret the message to make it conform to their preconceived notions. The Latin translation by the Christian missionary [[Constantius Joseph Beschi|Father Beshi]], for instance, contains several such mistranslations. According to V.

Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}}\n\nAccording to Zvelebil, the ''Tirukkural'' borrows \"a great number of lines\" and phrases from earlier Tamil texts. For example, phrases found in ''Kuruntokai'' (lit. \"The Collection of Short [Poems]\") and many lines in ''Narrinai'' (lit. \"The Excellent Love Settings\") which starts with an invocation to [[Vishnu]], appear in the later ''Tirukkural''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=15\u201316}} Authors who came after the composition of ''Tirukkural'' similarly extensively quoted and borrowed from the ''Tirukkural''. For example, the Prabandhas such as ''Tiruvalluvamalai'' probably from the 10th-century are anthologies on ''Tirukkural'', and these extensively quote and embed it verses written in meters ascribed to gods, goddesses, and revered Tamil scholars.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=58\u201359}} Similarly, the love story ''Perunkatai'' (lit. \"The Great Story\") probably composed in the 9th-century quotes from ''Tirukkural'' and embeds similar teachings and morals.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=135\u2013136}} Verse 22.59\u201361 the ''Manimekalai'' \u2013 a Buddhist-princess and later nun based love story epic, likely written about the 6th-century, also quotes ''Tirukkural''. This Buddhist epic ridicules Jainism while embedding morals and ideals similar to those in the Kural.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=140\u2013141 with footnotes}}\n\nThe Thirukkural teachings are similar to those found in ''Arthasastra'' but differ in some important aspects. In Thiruvalluvar's theory of state, unlike Kautilya, the army (''patai'') is the most important element. Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37 Thiruvalluvar recommends that a well kept and well-trained army (''patai'') led by an able commander and ready to go to war is necessary for a state.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=152-154, 144-151}}\n\nAccording to Hajela, the ''Porul'' of the Kural text is based on morality and benevolence as its cornerstones.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=901\u2013902}} The Tirukkural teaches that the ministers and people who work in public office should lead an ethical and moral life.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|p=92}} Unlike ''Manusmriti'', Tirukurral does not give importance to castes or any dynasty of rulers and ministers. The text states that one should call anyone with virtue and kindness a [[Brahmin]].{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|p=153}}\n\nAccording to Thomas Manninezhath \u2013 a theology scholar who grew up in South India, the ''Tirukkural'' is believed by the natives to reflect [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy and teaches an \"Advaitic way of life\".<ref name=\"Manninezhath1993p78\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Manninezhath|title=Harmony of Religions: Ved\u0101nta Siddh\u0101nta Samarasam of T\u0101yum\u0101navar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uE4-veDrY7AC&pg=PA78 |year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-1001-3|pages=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\n===World literature===\nScholars compare the teachings in ''Tirukkural'' with those in other ancient thoughts such as the Confucian sayings in [[Lun Yu]], [[Hitopadesa]], [[Panchatantra]], [[Manusmriti]], [[Tirumandiram]], [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible, sayings of the [[Buddha]] in [[Dhammapada]], and the ethical works of Persian origin such as [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] and [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]], in addition to the holy books of various religions.{{sfn|R.

Both Valluvar and [[Confucius]] focused on the behaviors and moral conducts of a common person. Similar to Valluvar, Confucius advocated legal justice embracing human principles, courtesy, and [[filial piety]], besides the virtues of [[wiktionary:benevolence|benevolence]], [[righteousness]], [[loyalty]] and [[trustworthiness]] as foundations of life.{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|pp=104-111}} While ahimsa remains the fundamental virtue of the Valluvarean tradition, [[Zen]] remains the central theme in Confucian tradition.{{sfn|Krishnamoorthy, 2004|pp=206\u2013208}} Incidentally, Valluvar differed from Confucius in two respects. Firstly, unlike Confucius, Valluvar was also a poet. Secondly, Confucius did not deal with the subject of [[conjugal love]], for which Valluvar devoted an entire division in his work.{{sfn|Anonymous|1999|p=vii}} Child-rearing is central to the Confucian thought of procreation of humanity and the benevolence of society.

The text has been translated into at least 40 Indian and non-Indian languages. The Kural is considered a masterpiece and one of the most important texts of the Tamil Literature.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} The Tamil people and the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] have long celebrated and upheld the text with reverence.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}}\n\n==Etymology and nomenclature==\n{{main|Glossary of names for the Tirukkural}}\nThe term ''Tirukkural'' is a compound word made of two individual terms, ''tiru'' and ''kural''. ''Tiru'' is an honorific Tamil term that corresponds to the universally Indian, Sanskrit term ''sri'' meaning \"holy, sacred, excellent, honorable, and beautiful.\"{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}} The term ''tiru'' has as many as 19 different meanings.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=vii}} ''Kural'' means something that is \"short, concise, and abridged.\"{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}} Etymologically, ''kural'' is the shortened form of ''kural paattu'', which is derived from ''kuruvenpaattu'', one of the two Tamil poetic forms explained by [[Tolkappiyam]], the other one being ''neduvenpaattu''.{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012a|pp=iv\u2013vi}} According to Winslow, ''kural'' is used as a literary term to indicate \"a metrical line of 2 feet, or a distich or couplet of short lines, the first of 4 and the second of 3 feet.\" Thus, ''Tirukkural'' literally comes to mean \"sacred couplets.\"{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}}\n\nThe work is highly cherished in the Tamil culture, as reflected by its nine different traditional titles: ''Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' (the sacred kural), ''Uttaravedam'' (the ultimate [[Veda]]), ''Thiruvalluvar'' (eponymous with the author), ''Poyyamoli'' (the falseless word), ''Vayurai valttu'' (truthful praise), ''Teyvanul'' (the divine book), ''Potumarai'' (the common Veda), ''Muppal'' (the three-fold path), and ''Tamilmarai'' (the Tamil Veda).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}\n\n== Date ==\n{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}\nThe Kural has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 5th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]], and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as [[Somasundara Bharathiar]] and M Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]], a [[Czechs|Czech]] scholar of Tamil literature, these early dates such as 300 BCE to 1 BCE are unacceptable and not supported by evidence within the text. The diction and grammar of the Kural, and Valluvar's indebtedness to some earlier Sanskrit sources, suggest that he lived after the \"early Tamil bardic poets\", but before Tamil bhakti poets era.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124 with footnotes}}\n\nIn 1959, [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to around or after the 6th century CE. His proposal is based on the evidence that the Kural text contains a large proportion of Sanskrit loan words, shows awareness and indebtedness to some Sanskrit texts best dated to the first half of the 1st millennium CE, and the grammatical innovations in the language of the Kural literature.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124 with footnotes}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Pillai published a list of 137 Sanskrit loan words in the Kural text.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=170-171}} Later scholars [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]] show that 35 of these are of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin and not Sanskrit loan words. Zvelebil states that an additional few have uncertain etymology and that future studies may prove those to be Dravidian.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=170-171}} The 102 remaining loan words from Sanskrit are \"not negligible\", and some of the teachings in the Kural text, according to Zvelebil, are \"undoubtedly\" based on the then extant Sanskrit works such as the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' and ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (also called the ''Manavadharmasastra'').{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=170-171}}\n\nIn his treatise of Tamil literary history published in 1974, Zvelebil states that the Kural text does not belong to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] period and dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} His estimate is based on the language of the text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared with these older texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the \"one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition\" as a few of the verses in the Kural text are \"undoubtedly\" translations of the verses of earlier Indian texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}\n\nIn the 19th century and the early 20th century, European writers and missionaries variously dated the text and its author to between 400 and 1000 CE.{{sfn|C. Blackburn, 2000|pp=454 with footnote 7}} According to Blackburn, the \"current scholarly consensus\" dates the text and the author to approximately 500 CE.{{sfn|C.

No other authentic pre-colonial texts have been found to support any legends about the life of Valluvar. Starting around early 19th century, numerous inconsistent legends on Valluvar in various Indian languages and English were published.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}}\n\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue at Kanyakumari 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|The statue of Valluvar, the author of the Kural text, on an island in [[Kanyakumari]] facing towards the Tamil Nadu coastline]]\nVarious claims have been made regarding Valluvar's family background and occupation in the colonial era literature, all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} One traditional version claims that he was a [[Paraiyar]] weaver.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=124-125}} Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of [[Vellalar]]s because he extols agriculture in his work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} Another states he was an outcaste, born to a Pariah woman and a [[Brahmin]] father.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} [[M. Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]] speculated that \"valluva\" in his name is a variation of \"vallabha\", the designation of a royal officer.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] derived his name from \"valluvan\" (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was \"the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|pp=24\u201326}} The traditional biographies not only are inconsistent, but also contain incredulous claims about the author of the Kural text. Along with various versions of his birth circumstances, many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary [[Agastya]] and other sages.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} There are also accounts claiming that, during his return journey, Valluvar sat under a tree whose shadow sat still over him and did not move the entire day, he killed a demon, and many more.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical, a feature common to \"international and Indian folklore\". The alleged low birth, high birth and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=459-464}}\n\nThe Kural text is aphoristic and non-denominational in nature and can be selectively interpreted in many ways. This has led almost every major religious group in [[India]], including [[Christianity]], to claim the work and its author as one of their own.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} In a manner similar to speculations of the author's biography, there has been much speculation about his religion with no historical evidence. The 19th-century Christian missionary [[George Uglow Pope]], for example, claimed that Valluvar must have lived in the 9th century CE, come in contact with Christian teachers such as [[Pantaenus]] of [[Alexandria]], imbibed Christian ideas and peculiarities of Alexandrian teachers and then wrote the \"wonderful Kurral\" with an \"echo of the 'Sermon of the Mount'.\"{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} This theory is ahistorical and discredited.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=42}} According to Zvelebil, the ethics and ideas in Valluvar's work are not [[Christian ethics]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}}\n\nValluvar is thought to have belonged to either [[Jainism]] or [[Hinduism]]. This can be observed in his treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept of both the religions. In the 1819 translation, [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Valluvar was a Jain or Hindu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=463-464}} According to Zvelebil, Valluvar's treatment of the chapters on [[moral vegetarianism]]{{Ref label|A|a|none}} and [[non-killing]] reflects the Jain precepts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} Certain epithets for God and ascetic values found in the text are found in Jainism, states Zvelebil. He theorizes that Valluvar was probably \"a learned Jain with eclectic leanings\", who was well acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} Nevertheless, early [[Digambara]] or [[Svetambara]] Jaina texts do not mention Valluvar or the Kural text. The first claim of Valluvar as an authority appears in a 16th-century Jain text.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1974|p=119 with footnote 10}}\n\nAccording to other scholars, Valluvar's writings suggest that he belonged to [[Hinduism]]. Hindu teachers have mapped his teachings in the Kural literature to the teachings found in Hindu texts.{{sfn|Swamiji Iraianban|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=xiii-xvii, Appendix note on verse 1103}} The three parts that the Kural is divided into, namely, ''a\u1e5fam'' (virtue), ''poru\u1e37'' (wealth) and ''inbam'' (love), aiming at attaining ''veedu'' (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, [[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]].{{sfn|P.S.

However, the subdivisions beyond these three, as found in some surviving manuscripts and commentaries, are likely later additions because there are variations between these subtitles found in manuscripts and those in historical commentaries.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013163}} For example, the following subdivisions are found in [[Parimelalhagar]]'s version, which greatly varies from that of [[Manakkudavar]]'s:{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\n* Chapters 1\u20134: Introduction\n* Chapters 5\u201324: Domestic virtue\n* Chapters 25\u201338: Ascetic virtue\n* Chapters 39\u201363: Royalty, the qualities of the leader of men\n* Chapters 64\u201373: The subject and the ruler\n* Chapters 74\u201396: Essential parts of state, shrewdness in public life\n* Chapters 97\u2013108: Reaching perfection in social life\n* Chapters 109\u2013115: Concealed love\n* Chapters 116\u2013133: Wedded love\n\nSuch subdivisions are likely later additions, but the couplets themselves have been preserved in the original form and there is no evidence of later revisions or insertions into the couplets.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013160}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nAccording to Zvelebil, the content of the Kural text is \"undoubtedly patterned\" and \"very carefully structured\".{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=163}} There are no structural gaps in the text, with every couplet indispensable for the structured whole. There are two distinct meanings for every couplet, namely, a structural one and a proverbial one. In their isolated form, that is, when removed from the context of the 10-couplet chapter, the couplets lose their structural meaning but retain the \"wise saying, moral maxim\" sense. In isolation, a couplet is \"a perfect form, possessing, in varying degree, the prosodic and rhetoric qualities of gnomic poetry.\"{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013163}} Within the chapter-structure, the couplets acquire their structural meaning and reveal the more complete teaching of the author. This, Zvelebil states, is the higher pattern in the Kural text, and finally, in relation to the entire work, they acquire perfection in the totality of their structure.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158\u2013163}} In terms of structural flow, the text journeys the reader from \"the imperfect, incomplete\" state of man implicit in the early chapters to the \"physically, morally, intellectually and emotionally perfect\" state of man living as a husband and citizen, states Zvelebil.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=159}}\n\nIn poetic terms, it fuses verse and aphoristic form in diction in a \"pithy, vigorous, forceful and terse\" manner. It is an ethics text that expounds a universal, moral and practical approach to life. Throughout the work, Valluvar is more considerate about the substance than the linguistic appeal of his writing.{{sfn|Mahadevan, 1985|p=187}}\n\n===Substance===\nThe text was written for its time, for the then contemporary society. It is marked by [[pragmatic idealism]],{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4333}} focused on \"man in the totality of his relationships\".{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4341}} According to Zvelebil, the Kural text does not feature \"true and great poetry\" throughout the work, except, notably, in the [[Inbam (Kural book)|third book]], which deals with love and pleasure. This emphasis on substance rather than poetry suggests that Valluvar's main aim was not to produce a work of art, but rather an instructive text focused on wisdom, justice, and ethics.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=168}}\n\nThe Kural text begins with an invocation of God and then praises the rain for being the vitalizer of all life forms on earth. It proceeds to describe the qualities of a righteous person, before concluding the introduction by emphasizing the value of ''a\u1e5fam'' or virtue.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}} Valluvar extols rain next only to God for it provides food and serves as the basis of a stable economic life by aiding in agriculture, which Valluvar asserts as the most important economic activity later in Book II of the Kural text.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=27}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote=\"The greatest virtue of all is non-killing; truthfulness cometh only next.\"|salign=right|source=(Kural 323; [[V.

Despite knowing its seemingly contradictory nature from a purist point of view, Valluvar employs this method to emphasise the importance of the given code of ethic. Following are some of the instances where Valluvar employs contradictions to expound the virtues.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n* While in Chapter 93 Valluvar writes on the evils of intoxication, in Chapter 109 he uses the same to show the sweetness of love by saying love is sweeter than wine.\n* To the question \"What is wealth of all wealth?\" Valluvar points out to two different things, namely, grace (Kural 241) and hearing (Kural 411).\n* In regard to the virtues one should follow dearly even at the expense of other virtues, Valluvar points to veracity (Kural 297), not coveting another's wife (Kural 150), and not being called a slanderer (Kural 181). In essence, however, in Chapter 33 he crowns non-killing as the foremost of all virtues, pushing even the virtue of veracity to the second place (Kural 323).\n* Whereas he says that one can eject what is natural or inborn in him (Kural 376), he indicates that one can overcome the inherent natural flaws by getting rid of laziness (Kural 609).\n* While in Chapter 7 he asserts that the greatest gain men can obtain is by their learned children (Kural 61), in Chapter 13 he says that it is that which is obtained by self-control (Kural 122).\n\n==Commentaries and translations==\n{{main|Translations of Tirukkural|List of Tirukkural translations by language|Tirukkural translations into English}}\n\n===Commentaries===\n[[File:Tirukkural manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Palm leaf manuscript of the Tirukkural]]\nThe Kural is one of the most reviewed of all works in [[Tamil literature]], and almost every notable scholar has written commentaries (explanation in prose or verse) on it.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{Ref label|F|f|none}} Some of the Tamil literature that was composed after the Kural quote or borrow its couplets in their own texts.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=337-338}} According to Aravindan, these texts may be considered as the early commentaries to the Kural text.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}\n\nDedicated commentaries on the Kural text appear about and after the 10th century CE. There were at least ten medieval commentaries of which only six have survived into the modern era. The [[Ten Medieval Commentators|ten medieval commentators]] include [[Manakkudavar]], [[Dharumar]], [[Dhamatthar]], [[Nacchar]], [[Paridhi]]yar, [[Thirumalaiyar]], [[Mallar (poet)|Mallar]], [[Pari Perumal]], [[Kaalingar]], and [[Parimelalhagar]], all of whom lived between the 10th and the 13th centuries CE. Of these, only the works of Manakkudavar, Paridhi, Kaalingar, Pari Perumal, and Parimelalhagar are available today. The works of Dharumar, Dhaamatthar, and Nacchar are only partially available. The commentaries by Thirumalaiyar and Mallar are lost completely. The best known among these are the commentaries by Parimelalhagar, Kaalingar, and Manakkudavar.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333\u20134334}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|p=2}} Among the ten medieval commentaries, scholars have found spelling, homophonic, and other minor textual variations in a total of 900 couplets, including 217 couplets in Book I, 487 couplets in Book II, and 196 couplets in Book III.{{sfn|Perunchithiranar, 1933|p=259}}\n\nThe best known and influential historic commentary on the Kural text is the ''Parimelalhakiyar virutti''. It was written by [[Parimelalhagar]] \u2013 a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Brahmin, likely based in [[Kanchipuram]], who lived about or before 1272 CE based on an inscription discovered in a Hindu temple dedicated to [[Vishnu|Varadaraja]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=126 with footnotes}} Along with the Kural text, this commentary has been widely published and is in itself a Tamil classic.{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=558-561, 563}} Parimelalhagar's commentary has survived over the centuries in many folk and scholarly versions. A more scholarly version of this commentary was published by Krisnamachariyar in 1965.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=126 with footnotes}} According to Norman Cutler, Parimelalhagar's commentary interprets and maneuvers the Kural text within his own context, grounded in the concepts and theological premises of Hinduism. His commentary closely follows the Kural's teachings, while reflecting both the cultural values and textual values of the 13th- and 14th-century Tamil Nadu. Valluvar's text can be interpreted and maneuvered in other ways, states Cutler.{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=558-561, 563}}\n\nBesides the ten medieval commentaries, there are at least three more commentaries written by unknown authors.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} One of them was published under the title \"Palhaiya Urai\" (meaning ancient commentary), while the second one was based on Paridhiyar's commentary.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} The third one was published in 1991 under the title \"Jaina Urai\" (meaning Jaina commentary) by [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]] in [[Thanjavur]].{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|p=129}} Following these medieval commentaries, there are at least 21 [[venpa]] commentaries to the Kural, including Somesar Mudumoli Venba, Murugesar Muduneri Venba, Sivasiva Venba, Irangesa Venba, and Vadamalai Venba, all of which are considered commentaries in verse form.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=ix}}{{sfn|Iraikuruvanar, 2009|pp=53\u201359}}\n\nSeveral modern commentaries started appearing in the 19th and 20th centuries.

For example, S. R. Ranganathan,\u00a0a librarian of [[University of Madras]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]], discovered a Malayalam translation copied in year 777 of the Malayalam calendar, a manuscript that Zvelebil dates to late 16th century.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=127 with footnote 99}} The text was translated into several European languages during the colonial era, particularly by the [[Christian missionaries]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=28\u201347}}\n\nThe first European language translation ([[Latin]]) was published by [[Constanzo Beschi|Constantius Joseph Beschi]] in 1730. However, he translated only the first two books, viz., virtue and wealth, leaving out the book on love because its erotic and sexual nature was deemed by him to be inappropriate for a Christian missionary. The first [[French language|French]] translation was brought about by an unknown author by about 1767 that went unnoticed. The first available French version was by [[E. S. Ariel]] in 1848. Again, he did not translate the whole work but only parts of it. The first [[German language|German]] translation was made by [[Karl Graul]], who published it in 1856 both at [[London]] and [[Leipzig]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=30\u201331}}<ref name=derkural>[https://archive.org/details/dli.RTa2/page/n7 Der Kural des Tiruvalluver], Karl Graul (1856), Williams & Norgate</ref>\n\nThe first, and incomplete, [[English language|English]] translations were made by N. E. Kindersley in 1794 and then by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1812. While Kindersley translated a selection of the Kural text, Ellis translated 120 couplets in all\u201469 of them in verse and 51 in prose.{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92\u201395}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1992|pp=}} [[Edward Jewitt Robinson|E. J.

It contained the original Tamil text of the Kural, Parimelalhagar's commentary, Ramanuja Kavirayar's amplification of the commentary and Drew's English prose translation. However, Drew translated only 630 couplets, and the remaining were translated by [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]], a native missionary. Like Beschi, Drew did not translate the third book on love.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=31}} The first complete English translation of the Kural was the one by the Christian missionary [[George Uglow Pope]] in 1886, which introduced the complete Kural to the western world.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=32}}\n\nThe translations of the Kural in Southeast Asian and East Asian languages were published in the 20th century. A few of these relied on re-translating the earlier English translations of the work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=127 with footnote 99}}\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, there were about 24 translations of the Kural in English alone, by both native and non-native scholars, including those by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]], [[K. M. Balasubramaniam]], [[Shuddhananda Bharati]], [[A. Chakravarti]], [[M. S. Purnalingam Pillai]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[P. S. Sundaram]], [[V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar]], [[G. Vanmikanathan]], [[Kasturi Srinivasan]], [[S. N. Sriramadesikan]], and [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=36}} The work has also been translated into [[Vaagri Booli language|Vaagri Booli]], the language of the [[Narikurava]]s, a tribal community in Tamil Nadu, by Kittu Sironmani.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 25 March 2013}}\n\n===Difficulties and distortions===\nWith a highly compressed prosodic form, the Kural text employs the intricately complex ''[[Kural (poetic form)|Kural venba]]'' [[Poetic metre|metre]], known for its eminent suitability to gnomic poetry.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=166}} This form, which Zvelebil calls \"a marvel of brevity and condensation,\" is closely connected with the structural properties of the Tamil language and has historically presented extreme difficulties to its translators.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=167}} Talking about translating the Kural into other languages, [[Herbert Arthur Popley]] observes, \"it is impossible in any translation to do justice to the beauty and force of the original.\"{{sfn|Popley, 1931|p=x}} Zvelebil claims that it is impossible to truly appreciate the maxims found in the Kural couplets through a translation but rather that the Kural has to be read and understood in its original Tamil form.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}}\n\nBesides these inherent difficulties in translating the Kural, some scholars have attempted to either read their own ideas into the Kural couplets or deliberately misinterpret the message to make it conform to their preconceived notions. The Latin translation by the Christian missionary [[Constantius Joseph Beschi|Father Beshi]], for instance, contains several such mistranslations. According to V. Ramasamy, \"Beschi is purposely distorting the message of the original when he renders {{lang|ta|\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bbf}} as \u2018the sea of miserable life\u2019 and the phrase {{lang|ta|\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bb2\u0bcd}} as \u2018sea of this birth\u2019 which has been translated by others as \u2018the sea of many births\u2019. Beschi means thus \u2018those who swim the vast sea of miseries\u2019. The concept of rebirth or many births for the same soul is contrary to Christian principle and belief.\"{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=33}}\n\nAccording to Norman Cutler, both in the past and in the contemporary era, the Kural has been reinterpreted and fit to reflect the textual values in the text as well as the cultural values of the author(s).{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=549-554}} About 1300 CE, the Tamil scholar Parimelalhagar interpreted the text in [[Brahmanical]] premises and terms.{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=549-554}} Just like Christian missionaries during the colonial era cast the work in their own Christian premises, phrases and concepts, some Dravidianists of the contemporary era reinterpret and cast the work to further their own goals and socio-political values. This has produced highly divergent interpretations of the original.{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=549-554}}{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=449-457}}\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:Thirukkural Madras 1812.JPG|thumb|150px|First known edition of the Kural, published in Tamil, in 1812.]]\n\nThe ''Thirukkural'' remained largely unknown outside India for over a millennium. In addition to [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s, it had been passed on as word of mouth from parents to their children and from preceptors to their students for generations within the Tamil-speaking regions of [[South India]]. According to Sanjeevi, the first translation of the work appeared in [[Malayalam]] (Kerala) in 1595.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44\u201349}} The first paper print of ''Tirukkural'' is traceable to 1812, credited to the efforts of \u00d1\u0101napirak\u0101car who used wooden blocks embossed from palm-leaf scripts to produce copies of the ''Kurral'' along with those of ''Nalatiyar''.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1992|p=160}} It was only in 1835 that Indians were permitted to establish printing press.

Sundaram|1987|pp=7\u201316}}\n\nAccording to Zvelebil, the ''Tirukkural'' borrows \"a great number of lines\" and phrases from earlier Tamil texts. For example, phrases found in ''Kuruntokai'' (lit. \"The Collection of Short [Poems]\") and many lines in ''Narrinai'' (lit. \"The Excellent Love Settings\") which starts with an invocation to [[Vishnu]], appear in the later ''Tirukkural''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=15\u201316}} Authors who came after the composition of ''Tirukkural'' similarly extensively quoted and borrowed from the ''Tirukkural''. For example, the Prabandhas such as ''Tiruvalluvamalai'' probably from the 10th-century are anthologies on ''Tirukkural'', and these extensively quote and embed it verses written in meters ascribed to gods, goddesses, and revered Tamil scholars.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=58\u201359}} Similarly, the love story ''Perunkatai'' (lit. \"The Great Story\") probably composed in the 9th-century quotes from ''Tirukkural'' and embeds similar teachings and morals.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=135\u2013136}} Verse 22.59\u201361 the ''Manimekalai'' \u2013 a Buddhist-princess and later nun based love story epic, likely written about the 6th-century, also quotes ''Tirukkural''. This Buddhist epic ridicules Jainism while embedding morals and ideals similar to those in the Kural.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=140\u2013141 with footnotes}}\n\nThe Thirukkural teachings are similar to those found in ''Arthasastra'' but differ in some important aspects. In Thiruvalluvar's theory of state, unlike Kautilya, the army (''patai'') is the most important element. Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37 Thiruvalluvar recommends that a well kept and well-trained army (''patai'') led by an able commander and ready to go to war is necessary for a state.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=152-154, 144-151}}\n\nAccording to Hajela, the ''Porul'' of the Kural text is based on morality and benevolence as its cornerstones.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=901\u2013902}} The Tirukkural teaches that the ministers and people who work in public office should lead an ethical and moral life.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|p=92}} Unlike ''Manusmriti'', Tirukurral does not give importance to castes or any dynasty of rulers and ministers. The text states that one should call anyone with virtue and kindness a [[Brahmin]].{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|p=153}}\n\nAccording to Thomas Manninezhath \u2013 a theology scholar who grew up in South India, the ''Tirukkural'' is believed by the natives to reflect [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy and teaches an \"Advaitic way of life\".<ref name=\"Manninezhath1993p78\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Manninezhath|title=Harmony of Religions: Ved\u0101nta Siddh\u0101nta Samarasam of T\u0101yum\u0101navar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uE4-veDrY7AC&pg=PA78 |year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-1001-3|pages=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\n===World literature===\nScholars compare the teachings in ''Tirukkural'' with those in other ancient thoughts such as the Confucian sayings in [[Lun Yu]], [[Hitopadesa]], [[Panchatantra]], [[Manusmriti]], [[Tirumandiram]], [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible, sayings of the [[Buddha]] in [[Dhammapada]], and the ethical works of Persian origin such as [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] and [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]], in addition to the holy books of various religions.{{sfn|R.

Similar to Valluvar, Confucius advocated legal justice embracing human principles, courtesy, and [[filial piety]], besides the virtues of [[wiktionary:benevolence|benevolence]], [[righteousness]], [[loyalty]] and [[trustworthiness]] as foundations of life.{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|pp=104-111}} While ahimsa remains the fundamental virtue of the Valluvarean tradition, [[Zen]] remains the central theme in Confucian tradition.{{sfn|Krishnamoorthy, 2004|pp=206\u2013208}} Incidentally, Valluvar differed from Confucius in two respects. Firstly, unlike Confucius, Valluvar was also a poet. Secondly, Confucius did not deal with the subject of [[conjugal love]], for which Valluvar devoted an entire division in his work.{{sfn|Anonymous|1999|p=vii}} Child-rearing is central to the Confucian thought of procreation of humanity and the benevolence of society.
