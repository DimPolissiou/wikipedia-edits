A post-WWII building boom then pushed the population upward to 353 in 1960. During the 1970s and 1980s, urban sprawl of the city of [[Tulsa]] reached Glenpool, and the town became a bedroom suburb.

By November 22, 1905, they had drilled through the Red Fork Sand, the deepest known producing sand in the area without striking oil. There was a small stream of natural gas at a depth of \n\n{{convert|1450|ft|m}}, so they decided to drill deeper. A few feet further down, the rig encountered a formation known as the Bartlesville Sand, where Chesley noticed the first trace of oil on the drill bit. The well began making a gurgling sound and soon emitted a gusher clear over the derrick. The well soon produced over 75 barrels a day of light, sweet crude oil.

Prices for leases and for drilling services rose sharply. Fewer than two percent of the wildcat wells failed to produce oil. Some of the Creek landowners began earning as much as a million dollars a year from royalties on the production from their 160-acre plots. According to one source,\"... More money was made on the Oklahoma oil boom than the [[California gold rush]] and Colorado silver rush combined.\"<ref name=\"GPOF\"/>\n\nAfter only one year, the Glenn Pool field had 127 completed wells. Of these, 107 produced oil, 12 found only gas and 11 were dry holes. In addition, 24 more wells were in progress and 33 sites were being readied for drilling. By 1907, the field was increasingly controlled by three companies: [[Texaco]], [[Gulf Oil|Gulf Oil Company]] and Prairie Oil and Gas. Galbreath and Chesley were ready to move on. They sold their Glenn Pool holdings to Edgar Crosbie for $US 500,000 and $US 200,000, respectively.<ref name = \"Davenport\"/>\n\nThe Ida Glenn well was plugged and abandoned in 1964.

Scott McLucas Studio.

{"title_page": "Exhibition Place", "text_new": "[[File:The Exhibition (Toronto).JPG|thumb|The [[Princes' Gates]] are the eastern entrance of Exhibition Place.]]\n'''Exhibition Place''' is a publicly owned [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use district]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, located by the [[Lake Shore Boulevard|shoreline]] of [[Lake Ontario]], just west of [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]]. The {{Convert|197 |acre|ha |adj=on}} site includes exhibit, trade, and banquet centres, theatre and music buildings, monuments, parkland, sports facilities, and a number of civic, provincial, and national historic sites. The district's facilities are used year-round for exhibitions, trade shows, public and private functions, and sporting events.\n\nFrom mid-August through [[Labour Day]] each year, the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE), which is now a private company, from which the name Exhibition Place is derived, is held on the grounds. During the CNE, Exhibition Place encompasses {{convert|260|acre|km2}}, expanding to include nearby parks and parking lots. The CNE uses the buildings for exhibits on agriculture, food, arts and crafts, government and trade displays. For entertainment, the CNE provides a [[midway (fair)|midway]] of rides and games, music concerts at the [[CNE Bandshell|Bandshell]], featured shows at the [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|Coliseum]], and the [[Canadian International Air Show]]. The fair is one of the largest and most successful of its kind in [[North America]] and an important part of the culture of Toronto.\n\nThe buildings on the site date from the 1700s to recent years. Five buildings on the site (the Fire Hall/Police Station, [[Government Building (Toronto)|Government Building]], [[Horticulture Building (Toronto)|Horticulture Building]], Music Building and Press Building), were designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1988.<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0548&oqeName=Gouinlock+Buildings+%2F+Early+Exhibition+Buildings&oqfName=%C9difices+Gouinlock Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},  Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada</ref><ref>[http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/com-ful_e.aspx?id=10470 Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings], National Register of Historic Places</ref> The grounds have seen a mix of protection for heritage buildings along with new development. The site was originally set aside for military purposes and gradually given over to exhibition purposes. One military building remains.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==The site==\n[[File:Gfp-canada-ontario-toronto-view-of-the-shoreline-from-the-tower.jpg|thumb|View of Exhibition Place from the [[CN Tower]] in 2013. The site is situated along the shoreline of [[Lake Ontario]], east of the [[Humber Bay]].]]\nExhibition Place is a rectangular site located length-wise along the north shoreline of [[Lake Ontario]] to the west of downtown Toronto. The site is mostly flat ground sloping down gently to the shoreline. It was originally forested land, and was cleared for military use. Sections east of Stanley Barracks and south were filled in the early part of the 20th century. Today, the district is mostly paved, with an area of parkland remaining in its western section. There is a large open paved area in the southern central section, which is used for parking and the temporary amusements of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE). The site has a variety of historic buildings, open spaces and monuments. The eastern entrance to Exhibition Place is marked by the large ceremonial Princes' Gates, named for [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and his brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Prince George]], who visited in 1927. The roads are all named after Canadian provinces and territories except for Princes' Boulevard which is the main street east-west. Several of the roads are used for the annual [[Honda Indy Toronto]] car race. South of the grounds is [[Ontario Place]], a theme park built in 1971 on landfill in Lake Ontario, and operated by the government of Ontario.\n\nThe site also has a long history of sports facilities on the site, starting with an equestrian track and grandstand. The grandstand eventually was converted for use by music concerts, major league [[baseball]] and [[Canadian football|football]] teams. The newest sports facility to be built is the [[association football|soccer]]-specific stadium, [[BMO Field]]. There is also an arena, the [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|Coliseum]], home to professional [[ice hockey]]. The site was used for several sports venues of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].\n\nThe site is administered by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place, appointed by the [[City of Toronto government]].<ref name=\"Exhibition Place\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/kb/docs/articles/special-purpose-bodies-and-external-organizations/agencies,-boards,-commissions-and-corporations-abccs/service-and-program-operating-boards/exhibition-place2.html |title=Exhibition Place |work= www.toronto.ca |accessdate=2018-01-13}}</ref> As of 2014, the organization had 133 full-time employees, up to 700 during major events, contributed $11 million annually to the City of Toronto, and attracted 5.3 million visitors annually to the site.

The area was an important portage route for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and the French wanted to capture their trade before they reached British posts to the south. It was burned by its garrison in 1759 after other French posts fell to the British on Lake Ontario.\n\nWhen the Town of [[York, Upper Canada|York]], the predecessor of Toronto, was inaugurated in the 1790s, the land to the east and west of the garrison (later [[Fort York]]) was reserved for military purposes. This includes all of today's Exhibition Place. Years later, the British military decided to replace Fort York with [[New Fort York]] (later the Stanley Barracks), to be located to the west of the existing fort. To finance this, the military sold the eastern half of the reserve. In 1840&ndash;1841, they constructed a series of six limestone buildings and several smaller ones. The fort was surrounded by a wood fence as elaborate defensive works were never built. The fort was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870, which named it [[Stanley Barracks]] in 1893.\n\n[[File:Crystal Palace 1871.jpg|thumb|The Palace of Industry, designed after the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in London, was erected for the 1858 fair.]]\n\nThe Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for [[Canada West]] inaugurated the [[Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West]] in 1846, to be held annually in different localities. For the 1858 fair, to be held in Toronto, a permanent \"Palace of Industry\" exhibition building, based on London's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], was built at [[King Street (Toronto)|King]] and Shaw Streets in what is now [[Liberty Village]]. The site held four more fairs until the 1870s when the City of Toronto government decided the exhibition had outgrown the site. The City signed a lease with the Government of Canada for a section of the western end of the reserve in April 1878. The Palace of Industry was moved to a site on the reserve near today's Horticulture Building, reconstructed and expanded. The City sold the King and Shaw site to the [[Massey Ferguson|Massey Manufacturing Company]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Torontoist |url=http://torontoist.com/2008/08/historicist_an_exhibition_in_crysta/ |title=Historicist: An Exhibition in Crystal |first=Jamie |last=Bradburn | date=August 23, 2008 |accessdate=October 28, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1878 Provincial Agricultural Fair was held on the grounds. When [[Ottawa]] was chosen to host the 1879 fair, Toronto decided to hold its own fair. First called the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, it was held in the Crystal Palace and temporary buildings. At first, the eastern part of the site was still reserved for military purposes, the exhibition held on the western part of the reserve, where many of the oldest exhibit buildings are located. As time went by, more and more of the reserve was taken over for exhibition purposes, including a horse track and grandstand, and exhibit buildings.\n\n===Development of permanent buildings===\n[[File:Dufferin Gate Toronto circa 1910.JPG|thumb|The Dufferin Gates were replaced with a more elaborate archway in 1910.]]\nIn 1902, after the Government of Canada announced it would sponsor a major exhibition at the site in 1903, the Toronto City Council decided to rebuild the exhibition site. In 1903, the Government of Canada reached an agreement to transfer the remaining military reserve to the City of Toronto. Under the agreement, military uses were permitted to continue until such time that replacement facilities were built. Included in this was Old Fort York, which the City committed to preserve.{{sfn|Sendzikas|2011|p=89}} The building campaign saw the building of fifteen permanent buildings designed by architect [[George Wallace Gouinlock|G. W. Gouinlock]] from 1903 until 1912, including the surviving Press Building, Horticulture Building, [[Government Building (Toronto)|Government Building]], Music Building and Fire Hall / Police Station. The new buildings were elaborately designed and set in an attractively landscaped site. At the conclusion of the building campaign, the name was officially changed to the Canadian National Exhibition. The five remaining buildings were declared a historic site in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=HistoricPlaces.ca |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=10470 |title=Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings National Historic Site of Canada |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the older buildings were lost to fire during this time, including the first Grandstand and the Crystal Palace (known as the Transportation Building) in 1906. In 1910, the Dufferin Gates were replaced with a more elaborate arch and out-buildings on each side. During World War I, the Government Building was used as a barracks for soldiers, and a tent camp was set up on the site of the current [[CNE Ontario Government Building|Ontario Government Building]] (now Liberty Grand). The Dufferin Gates were patrolled by soldiers.\n\nWhen the CNE became the world's largest annual fair in 1920, a 50-year plan was launched following the urban design and architectural precedents of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Osbaldeston|2008|pp=197\u2013198}} [[Chapman and Oxley]] prepared the 1920 plan, which emphasized [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] and [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] urban design. The Empire Court was to be a monumental central space with a triumphal arch and gates and monumental exhibition buildings with courtyards.\n[[File:Coliseum exterior photo ca 1922.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coca-Cola Coliseum|The Coliseum]] was opened in 1921 to host the [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]].]]\nDuring the 1920s, the exhibition grounds were expanded to the west and to the east, as well as to the south, where [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] was used to build [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] (originally \"Boulevard Drive\"), connecting downtown with Toronto's growing western suburbs. The Coliseum, to host the new [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]], was opened in 1921, followed by the Government of Ontario Building in 1926, the Princes' Gates in 1927, and the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1928. By the 1930s, the Beaux-Arts style faded in popularity. The start of the trend for a new style of architecture arguably became evident in the construction of the Automotive Building in 1929, the first building that moved away from the Beaux-Art architecture envisioned by the 1920 plan, mixing clean modern lines with classical ornamentation. In 1931, the [[Horse Palace]] was built, replacing temporary stables used for the Winter Fair. The Horse Palace used [[Art Deco]] ornamentation. In 1936, the Art Deco [[CNE Bandshell|Bandshell]] was constructed for open-air music concerts.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the exhibition grounds became Toronto's main military training grounds. The CNE, and virtually all other non-military uses of the lands ceased. The CNE was not held between 1942 and 1946, when the land and its facilities were turned over to the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] as a training ground. The Graphic Arts Building housed Red Cross facilities, the Coliseum became the RCAF Manning Depot, the Horse Palace was used for barracks and the Automotive Building became the shore facility HMCS ''York'' for the Royal Canadian Navy.<ref>''Structures'', episode ''CNE During World War 2'', Rogers TV, 2001</ref> After World War II, the buildings were used as a [[demobilization]] centre. The CNE would resume again in 1947, as the Canadian military returned the grounds back to its civilian administrators.\n\n=== Post World War II ===\nAfter the military vacated Stanley Barracks, the CNE made plans for the Barracks' demolition. However, until 1951, the buildings were used for emergency housing. The first phase of demolition in 1951 demolished all of the wooden buildings, leaving only the original stone buildings.{{sfn|Sendzikas|2011|pp=148-150}} In 1953, despite public opposition, three of the remaining four stone buildings were demolished for parking, leaving only the Officers' Quarters. In 1955, the Quarters found its first CNE use, for Sports Hall of Fame exhibits before being turned into a year-round Maritime Museum in 1959.{{sfn|Sendzikas|2011|pp=1548-155}}\n\nA new phase of building construction followed, replacing buildings destroyed by fire, demolished for the Gardiner Expressway, or needed expansions. The new buildings, mostly in the central block of the site, exhibited a new [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] style of architecture. In 1946, the third Grandstand burned down. In its place was built the fourth Grandstand, a massive concrete construction and monumental cantilevered steel roof was a sharp contrast to the other buildings around it. The Modernist trend continued with the construction of other buildings and monuments typifying the modernist style including the Food Building (1954), the Shell Oil Tower (1955), Queen Elizabeth Building (1957) and the Princess Margaret Fountain (1958).\n\nIn the later 1950s, the new six-lane Gardiner Expressway was pushed through the north side of the grounds, cut below grade in the western section of the grounds, and an elevated section in the eastern section. This necessitated the demolition of the Dufferin Gate, the Women's Rest building{{sfn|Lorimer|1973|p=102}} and the Machinery Hall. The new [[parabolic arch]] Dufferin Gate was built in 1959. \n[[File:Hall of Fame Facade.jpg|thumb|right|Remnant of Hall of Fame building facade at [[BMO Field]]. The building housed the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] from 1961 to 2006.]]\nOn January 3, 1961, the Manufacturer's Building and the Women's Building (the one built prior to the Queen Elizabeth Building) were destroyed by fire.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Toronto Star |title=Flames Turn CNE Landmark to Rubble |page=31 |date=January 4, 1961}}</ref> The buildings were replaced by the Better Living Centre, which came with a distinctive [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]-inspired ornament on its roof. In 1961, the Hall of Fame building opened north of the Grandstand to house [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] and the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. In 1963, the Coliseum was re-clad with a modernist south facade. To replace its exhibit in the Ontario Government Building, the Government of Ontario built Ontario Place on artificial islands to the south of Exhibition Place (accessible via two foot bridges).\n\nCoinciding with the opening of the ultra-modern Ontario Place to the south, a new master plan for the Exhibition site was developed in 1971. The 1971 Master Plan was radical, calling for the demolition of many pre-World War II buildings, new Modernist buildings, and a massive central public space with a reflecting pool and fountains on the site of Exhibition Stadium, which was to be relocated. The plan proposed the demolition of the Fire Station, Art Gallery, General Exhibits Building, Railways Building, Government Building, Ontario Government Building, Automotive Building, Transportation Building, Band Shell, Grandstand, Shell Tower and the 1959 Dufferin Gate.{{sfn|Lorimer|1973|p=118}} A monorail was proposed to move people around the site and to and from the parking lots. It had first been proposed to connect Union Station and the Exhibition Grounds. Dufferin Street was to be connected to Lake Shore Boulevard, a new four-lane road along the north of the site and a new 1800-place parking lot taking the place of buildings to the west of Dufferin.{{sfn|Lorimer|1973|p=118}}\n\n[[File:Blue Jays v White Sox 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Redeveloped [[Exhibition Stadium]] in 1977, during the second game played by the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].]]\n\nThe plan resulted in some demolition, such as the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1972 (allegedly in poor structural condition) and the General Exhibits Building and Art Gallery, which were in the path of the new road. In 1974, the International Building, (formerly the Transportation Building), to the west of the bandshell, burnt down. It was hosting an exhibit on [[Spain]] during the CNE when it caught fire and was destroyed. The building was demolished and not replaced, the site left vacant and has since used mostly as a parking lot. The 1971 plan was abandoned after Exhibition Stadium was redeveloped and enlarged to host [[Major League Baseball]] in 1977.{{sfn|Osbaldeston|2008|pp=203\u2013206}} The site officially became Exhibition Place, partly in recognition that very little of the site was retained as parklands.\n\nIn 1978, to celebrate the centenary of the fair, a copy of the original 1913 music bandstand was built on the site of the original in the park north of the Horticulture Building. North of the park a new structure designed to resemble the 1870s-era exhibition buildings was added.<ref name=tce-music>{{cite web |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-national-exhibition-emc/ |title=Music at the Canadian National Exhibition |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref> The buildings host mostly children's activities during the CNE.

The race, known today as the Honda Indy Toronto, has taken place annually since, and is part of the [[IndyCar Series]]. The streets of Exhibition Place are closed off to regular traffic and a closed circuit is made through the grounds and along Lake Shore Boulevard. The race meant the end of the landmark Bulova/Shell Oil observation tower.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Torontoist |url=http://torontoist.com/2013/08/lets-go-to-the-ex-for-the-134th-time/slide/20130813shelltower/ |title=Let\u2019s Go to the Ex, for the 135th Time |first=Jamie |last=Bradburn |accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the Music Building, which had closed due to structural problems, was gutted by fire. The 1907 exterior was restored and a new interior was built.<ref name=tce-music/>\n\n===New emphasis on year-round use===\nIn the 1990s, budget pressures on the City of Toronto led to a new emphasis on the self-sufficiency of Exhibition Place. It saw the tear-down of the permanent midway buildings and the Flyer roller coaster. The City planned to charge rent to the midway's operator, Conklin Shows, which chose to tear down the buildings instead and set up temporary rides each year for the CNE.\n\n[[File:Ricohcoliseum.jpg|thumb|The [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], moved into [[Coca-Cola Coliseum]] in 2003.]]\n\nThe new National Trade Centre (now the Enercare Centre) trade show building, planned since the 1971 plan, was built on the vacant Electrical Building site to host more and larger trade shows year-round. It incorporated the Coliseum and Annex buildings to create one large exhibit space. In 2003, the Coliseum was rebuilt and expanded to provide a home for professional ice hockey. It is currently the home of the [[Toronto Marlies]] team from October to April each year.\n\nThe trend to utilize the grounds year-round to cover the grounds' expense, continued with the rental of the Arts & Crafts Building to the Medieval Times theatre company, the Ontario Government Building was rented to become event space known as \"Liberty Grand\", and the Horticulture Building became a night club known as \"Muzik.\" The Automotive Building was turned over to private management and is used exclusively for private events and conferences.\n\nIn 1999, Exhibition Stadium, mostly vacant after the opening of the downtown [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] stadium, was demolished. The site was vacant until 2007, when the new BMO Field soccer stadium, a public-private partnership, was built on the site to bring [[Major League Soccer]] to Toronto. The new soccer stadium also meant the end of the Hall of Fame building. The Hockey Hall of Fame had vacated earlier for downtown Toronto. A portion of the Hall of Fame facade was retained as one of the entrances to the new stadium. As a demonstration project, a [[WindShare]] [[wind turbine]] was built to the west of the Fort Rouill\u00e9 site.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the Exhibition Place grounds has seen several proposals for new uses. In July 2005, the City of Toronto asked for aquarium proposals from private enterprises. The only two respondents, [[Ripley Entertainment]] and Oceanus Holdings, suggested that they would be interested provided the location was closer downtown or had better transit access and parking. When the City of Toronto was considering the construction of a permanent casino, the CNE was the site of several proposals. The aquarium was built next to the CN tower and the City chose not to build a permanent casino.\n\nTwo new buildings have been added at Exhibition Place. In the north-west corner, the [[Toronto Raptors]] basketball team built a new practice facility which is shared part-time with the community. In the south-east, along Lake Shore Boulevard, the \"Hotel X\" hotel was constructed on the site of New Fort York. The foundations of several of the New Fort York buildings were revealed as part of the development. The hotel was built to complement the facilities of the Enercare and Allstream Centres. The soccer stadium was recently expanded, and adapted to allow it to host the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Toronto Argonauts]].\n\n===2015 Pan Am and Parapan Games===\n[[File:PanAmbeachvolleyball center.jpg|thumb|The [[Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre]] at Exhibition Place. The centre, along with other facilities at Exhibition Place was used as event venues for the [[2015 Pan Am Games]].]]\n\nIn July 2015, Exhibition Place was the site of sporting venues for the [[2015 Pan American Games]]. The collection of sites was referred to as \"CIBC Pan Am Park\" and each building was given a venue name. The Enercare Centre and Coliseum buildings were used for indoor sports, temporary facilities for beach volleyball were built south of BMO Field and a watercourse laid out on Lake Ontario. As a result of the games, the 2015 Toronto Honda Indy was scheduled in June to allow for time for the site to prepare for the Pan Am Games. As well the site was wound down in time for setup for the 2015 Canadian National Exhibition (scheduled to open August 21).\n\n==Buildings==\nWhile the CNE only lasts for a few weeks at the end of the summer, many major permanent buildings and other structures have been built over the years. Most are used for other purposes throughout the year.\n[[File:Stanley Barracks.jpg|thumb|left|Stanley Barracks Officers' Quarters. Erected in 1840, the building is the last remaining structure of [[New Fort York]], a military installation that was built at Exhibition Place.]]\nThe west end of the grounds is the original site of exhibitions and the oldest buildings are located here. There are five purpose-built fair buildings designed by architect G. W. Gouinlock: the Horticulture Building, built in 1907; the Government Building, built in 1912; the Music Building, built in 1907; the Administration Building, built in 1905; and the Fire Hall/Police Station, built in 1912. Just south of Dufferin Gate is Centennial Square, a green space with a bandstand. The Ontario Government Building was added later in 1926. The Bandshell, modeled after the famed Art Deco Hollywood Bowl was built in 1936, replacing a 1906 bandstand. North of the Bandshell is Bandshell Park, a large open green space for gatherings. Near the Bandshell is the 1790s [[Scadding Cabin]], the only building dating to the 1879 inaugural exhibition. There are two large fountains; the Princess Margaret Fountain and the Shrine Monument Fountain south of the Bandshell. To the west of Bandshell park, the former International Building site is now a parking lot, and there is a parking lot in the north-west corner of the site.\n\nThe central block contains more recent 1950-1960s buildings, which are all replacements for earlier buildings, and are larger than the buildings to the west: the Better Living Centre (exhibition space), the Queen Elizabeth Building complex (theatre, exhibition and administration sections) and the Food Building. The BMO Field soccer stadium, built in 2007, is situated on the site of the 1947 Grandstand and the 1961 Halls of Fame building. South of BMO Field is a large open parking lot and midway area. The CNE plans to make the area a public square, and move the parking underground. South of the central section are two pedestrian bridges over Lake Shore Boulevard to the Ontario Place complex.\n\nThe east block was the most active area of military usage and retains the only military building left on the site, the Stanley Barracks Officers' Quarters, dating to the 1840s. The area is a mix of buildings, including the older Coliseum, Horse Palace and newer buildings. The section is dominated by the exhibition complex of the Enercare Centre, Coliseum and the Industry Building. The Horse Palace (which adjoins the Coliseum and is used for equine shows and quartering), the Automotive Building (which was once used for car shows and is now a conference centre) and the General Services Building are all older exhibition buildings dating from the 1920s. The new \"Hotel X\" project includes a display of foundations of New Fort York which once occupied part of the site.\n\n===Sports venues===\nExhibition Place was also home to [[Exhibition Stadium]], which was built out of the fourth Grandstand by adding two extra wings of seats. The original grandstand had been constructed in the late 1800s and was re-modelled, replaced, or destroyed over the years. It served as home to the CFL's Toronto Argonauts between 1958 and 1988 and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (AL) between 1977 and 1989. The two teams left for SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) in 1989. After it lost many stadium concert tours to Rogers Centre, and many other outdoor concerts to the nearby [[Molson Amphitheatre]] at Ontario Place, its usefulness was at an end. The stadium was demolished in 1999 to serve as parking and allow a more sprawling midway. However, on October 26, 2005, the City of Toronto approved the construction of a 20,000 seat soccer stadium (BMO Field) on Exhibition Place land.\n\n==== Exhibition Stadium (former stadium) ====\n{{main|Exhibition Stadium}}\n[[File:Exhibition stadium.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Exhibition Stadium in 1992, several years before it was demolished.]]\nThe CNE has been host to four grandstands since its inception. The third grandstand, designed by G. W. Gouinlock, was built in 1907 and had a capacity of 16,000. It burned down in 1946, subsequently leading to the construction of the fourth (known as [[CNE Grandstand]]), built in 1948. Designed by [[architect]]s Marani and Morris, this building was the first of what would prove to be several [[Modernism|Modernist]] buildings built on the CNE grounds, its distinctive and bold cantilevered truss roof dominating the grounds for over 50 years. It initially housed 22,000 people, but was expanded over the years to a maximum of 54,000 in order to accommodate the additional seating required for major professional sports teams who made the Grandstand their home. It became the home base for the Toronto Argonauts football team, and later, to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. Architect Bill Sanford designed the alterations for baseball in 1976.\n\nA stock car race held on the grounds marked a historical race;  on July 18, 1958, [[Richard Petty]] made his NASCAR [[Grand National Series]] debut at Exhibition Stadium.\n\nIn addition to sports, CNE Grandstand was the stage for many entertainers over the years. Famous comedians who were featured there included [[Bob Hope]], [[Victor Borge]], and [[Bill Cosby]]. Similarly, many well-known musical acts made an appearance at the venue, ranging from [[Duke Ellington]], [[Guy Lombardo]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[The Beach Boys]] (appearing there 11 times between 1974 and 1990), [[The Monkees]], [[Sonny & Cher]], to [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[The Who]],  [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Tina Turner]]. After the grandstand was demolished, open-air concerts during the CNE have been held at the Bandshell.\n\nThe Blue Jays and Argos left the open-air Exhibition Stadium for the retractable roofed Skydome (now, the Rogers Centre) in 1989. By that time it was recognized that the building was beginning to visibly decay, and was little used in its final decade of existence. Though it was the earliest of the modernist-style buildings on the grounds, it was the only one not to be become a historically listed building. It was finally demolished in 1999.\n\n==== BMO Field (current stadium) ====\n{{main|BMO Field}}\n[[File:BMO Field in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Stadium|[[BMO Field]] is an outdoor field located at Exhibition Place.]]\nIn 2007, the open-air BMO Field [[soccer-specific stadium]] was constructed on the site of the former Exhibition Stadium and the Canada Sports Hall of Fame buildings. The Hall of Fame building had been vacated by the Hockey Hall of Fame and was demolished to make way for the stadium. The stadium was built to host [[Toronto FC]], the Major League Soccer (MLS) team as well as the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canadian national soccer team]]. Capacity is approximately 31,000 people. It opened on April 28, 2007, the start of the 2007 MLS season. Under the FIFA-sanctioned name \"National Soccer Stadium\", it was the center-piece venue for the 2007 [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. It was expanded for the 2015 season and had a new roof installed for the 2016 season. In conjunction with the stadium construction, Princes' Boulevard was re-routed to the south of the stadium.\n\n==== Coliseum ====\n{{main|Coca-Cola Coliseum}}\nThe Coliseum (1922, now part of the Enercare Centre complex) is an indoor arena. It is an example of Beaux-Arts design by City architect [[George F.W. Price]] and renovated by [[Brisbin Brook Beynon, Architects]]. Its main entrance was originally to the north, and the building was remodelled with a Modernist facade main entrance to the south in 1963. The original facade was restored when the Enercare Centre was built. It is home to the [[minor league]] Toronto Marlies professional ice hockey team during the winter months. Every November, it is used for the \"Royal Horse Show\" component of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair annually in November.\n\n==== OVO Athletic Centre ====\n{{main|OVO Athletic Centre}}\n[[File:OVO Athletic Centre Southeast 2019.jpg|thumb|The [[OVO Athletic Centre]] was completed in 2016.]]\nIn another partnership with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the new OVO Athletic Centre (originally known as the Biosteel Centre) was completed in 2016 at the west end of Exhibition Place on parking lot lands. The facility is a practice facility for the Toronto Raptors [[National Basketball Association]] team. It has two basketball courts. The facility displaced some parkland, including a [[baseball diamond]] on the site used for a CNE tournament.\n\n===Exhibit buildings===\n==== Better Living Centre ====\n[[File:BetterLivingCentre CNE-Grounds Aug25-05.jpg|thumb|left|The Better Living Centre is a [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] building opened in 1962.]]\nOne of the Modernist buildings on the site, the original purpose of the Better Living Centre was to introduce new ranges of consumer goods to the baby boomer generation, making it a \"space of encounter between consumer and product\". For many people attending the CNE, the building hosted their first encounters with such technologies as [[Color television#Color television|colour television]], [[transistor radio]]s or [[home computer]]s. It also became the place where people would expect to see the latest models of various consumer goods, ranging from [[vacuum cleaner]]s to kitchen appliances.\n\nThe building's stark modernist architecture, made up of large white forms, a vast flat roof and harsh angles, suited its futurist themes. The building was designed by [[architect]]s Marani, Morris and Allan{{sfn|Martins-Manteiga|2007|p=95}} and was opened by Toronto mayor [[Nathan Phillips (politician)|Nathan Phillips]] on August 17, 1962. It was built on the former site of the Manufacturers' building, which burned down in 1961. The new building replaced the exhibit space of the Manufacturers' Building and the General Exhibit Building.\n\nThe CNE no longer uses the Better Living Centre for its original purpose of introducing consumers to the latest and greatest products during the CNE. Instead, it has been divided in two. One-half hosts the CNE Casino for the month of August, while the other half is the \"Farm, Food and Fun\" pavilion during the CNE.\n\nThe building is used at other times of the year for special events. It hosts an indoor amusement park during March Break and a Hallowe'en exhibit \"Screamers\" during the month of October.\n\n====Enercare Centre====\n{{main|Enercare Centre}}\n[[File:DirectEnergyCentre3.jpg|thumb|right|The Enercare Centre is Canada's largest indoor exhibition hall.]]\nThe Enercare Centre (1997), along Princes' Boulevard,  has seven exhibit halls with one million square feet (90,000 m\u00b2) of space. The new building, first known as the National Trade Centre, took over the location of the old TTC streetcar loop and CNE entrance and the open space vacant since the Electrical and Engineering Building was demolished. It is interconnected with the [[Ricoh Coliseum]] and the Industry Building to the north to provide one large, configurable exhibition space. Home to the Toronto International Boat Show, the National Home Show, the One of A Kind Show, and the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Designed by architectural teams [[Zeidler Partnership Architects]] and [[Dunlop-Farrow Architects]]. During the exhibition, the building houses the international product displays and animal shows.\n\n====Food Building====\nThe Food Building (1954) was built to replace the original [[Pure Food Building]] (c. 1922 and demolished 1953). It was designed by [[Richard A. Fisher]].{{sfn|Martins-Manteiga|2007|p=85}} Water cascades down the windows of the east and west entrances to the building.

It is not only the oldest building on the grounds, but the [[List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto|oldest building in Toronto]]. It was built by the [[The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) (RCAC)|Queen's York Rangers]] in 1794 on behalf of [[John Scadding]], who served as clerk (essentially, an executive assistant) to the first [[List of lieutenant governors of Ontario|lieutenant governor of Upper Canada]], [[John Graves Simcoe]]. The original cabin was disassembled from its original site and rebuilt by the York Pioneers, along with an adjacent cabin made out of new logs, on the current site, just in time for the original Toronto Industrial Exhibition in 1879.\n[[File:Scadding Cabin - CNE Grounds, Toronto (September 1 2005).jpg|thumb|left|[[Scadding Cabin]] is Toronto's oldest standing structure. Erected in 1794, it was moved to its present site in 1879.]]\nScadding was given a plot of land from what is now just north of Gerrard Street East, south to the waterfront. The cabin was built close to the Don River's east side, on what is now part of the [[Don Valley Parkway]], just south of [[Queen Street East]]. Scadding sold the property in 1818 to William Smith. In 1879, his son William Smith offered the cabin to the [[York Pioneers]], a local historical society. Around this time, someone mistook the information concerning the original owner for the cabin, leading to it being erroneously called \"The Governor Simcoe cabin\". John Scadding's youngest son, [[Henry Scadding]] wrote an early history of York/Toronto and set the record straight on who the original owner of the cabin was. When he died in 1901, the York Pioneers renamed it \"The Scadding Cabin\", in honour of this son of the original owner, who had also been a past president of their society.\n\nIt is a squat, two-storey [[log cabin]] with low ceilings, designed to retain the heat from the fire in winter close to its occupants. It is said that John Graves Simcoe, who was over {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, had to stoop in order to enter the building. The building as it now stands is little changed from its original construction. Apparently an additional {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} extension that would have appeared to the south of the building was not moved. The second cabin constructed next to it by the York Pioneers was built using wood that was too green, and it was demolished a few years after construction. Over the years some of the timbers have been replaced, and the cabin was remounted on a stone foundation in the late part of the 20th century. Inside the cabin are furnishings appropriate to a house in [[Upper Canada]] in the 1830s, and some known to have belonged to Simcoe.\n\n===Music and entertainment venues===\n\n==== Bandshell ====\n{{main|CNE Bandshell}}\n[[File:Toronto bandshell.jpg|thumb|The [[CNE Bandshell]] with a modern canopy extension in 2007.

Named after [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the original gate to the CNE grounds was named in his honour, situated at the bottom of [[Dufferin Street]], also named after the same person. The original gateway was erected in 1895, and was superseded by a more permanent, ornate Beaux-Arts style triumphal arch built in 1910, and officially re-opened by Lord Dufferin in 1914.\n\nWith the construction of Toronto's [[Gardiner Expressway]] in 1956, the gates were demolished in order to make way for the roadway. In their place a modernist-style [[parabola|parabolic]] arch was erected {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} south of the previous gates in 1956, designed by architect [[Philip R.

The Art Deco elements of the Horse Palace include a hard-edged angular composition, cubist forms and strong horizontal and vertical planes.  The low relief sculptured friezes of horses located on the exterior of the building are also indicative of the Art Deco style of design. It is also the permanent home of the Toronto Police Service Mounted Unit, a branch of City of Toronto Animal Services and a riding academy.\n* The [[Horticulture Building (Toronto)|Horticulture Building]], designed by G.

The {{Convert|197 |acre|ha |adj=on}} site includes exhibit, trade, and banquet centres, theatre and music buildings, monuments, parkland, sports facilities, and a number of civic, provincial, and national historic sites. The district's facilities are used year-round for exhibitions, trade shows, public and private functions, and sporting events.\n\nFrom mid-August through [[Labour Day]] each year, the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE), which is now a private company, from which the name Exhibition Place is derived, is held on the grounds. During the CNE, Exhibition Place encompasses {{convert|260|acre|km2}}, expanding to include nearby parks and parking lots. The CNE uses the buildings for exhibits on agriculture, food, arts and crafts, government and trade displays. For entertainment, the CNE provides a [[midway (fair)|midway]] of rides and games, music concerts at the [[CNE Bandshell|Bandshell]], featured shows at the [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|Coliseum]], and the [[Canadian International Air Show]]. The fair is one of the largest and most successful of its kind in [[North America]] and an important part of the culture of Toronto.\n\nThe buildings on the site date from the 1700s to recent years. Five buildings on the site (the Fire Hall/Police Station, [[Government Building (Toronto)|Government Building]], [[Horticulture Building (Toronto)|Horticulture Building]], Music Building and Press Building), were designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1988.<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0548&oqeName=Gouinlock+Buildings+%2F+Early+Exhibition+Buildings&oqfName=%C9difices+Gouinlock Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},  Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada</ref><ref>[http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/com-ful_e.aspx?id=10470 Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings], National Register of Historic Places</ref> The grounds have seen a mix of protection for heritage buildings along with new development. The site was originally set aside for military purposes and gradually given over to exhibition purposes. One military building remains.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==The site==\n[[File:Gfp-canada-ontario-toronto-view-of-the-shoreline-from-the-tower.jpg|thumb|View of Exhibition Place from the [[CN Tower]] in 2013. The site is situated along the shoreline of [[Lake Ontario]], east of the [[Humber Bay]].]]\nExhibition Place is a rectangular site located length-wise along the north shoreline of [[Lake Ontario]] to the west of downtown Toronto. The site is mostly flat ground sloping down gently to the shoreline. It was originally forested land, and was cleared for military use. Sections east of Stanley Barracks and south were filled in the early part of the 20th century. Today, the district is mostly paved, with an area of parkland remaining in its western section. There is a large open paved area in the southern central section, which is used for parking and the temporary amusements of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE). The site has a variety of historic buildings, open spaces and monuments. The eastern entrance to Exhibition Place is marked by the large ceremonial Princes' Gates, named for [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and his brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Prince George]], who visited in 1927. The roads are all named after Canadian provinces and territories except for Princes' Boulevard which is the main street east-west. Several of the roads are used for the annual [[Honda Indy Toronto]] car race. South of the grounds is [[Ontario Place]], a theme park built in 1971 on landfill in Lake Ontario, and operated by the government of Ontario.\n\nThe site also has a long history of sports facilities on the site, starting with an equestrian track and grandstand. The grandstand eventually was converted for use by music concerts, major league [[baseball]] and [[Canadian football|football]] teams. The newest sports facility to be built is the [[association football|soccer]]-specific stadium, [[BMO Field]]. There is also an arena, the [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|Coliseum]], home to professional [[ice hockey]]. The site was used for several sports venues of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].\n\nThe site is administered by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place, appointed by the [[City of Toronto government]].<ref name=\"Exhibition Place\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/kb/docs/articles/special-purpose-bodies-and-external-organizations/agencies,-boards,-commissions-and-corporations-abccs/service-and-program-operating-boards/exhibition-place2.html |title=Exhibition Place |work= www.toronto.ca |accessdate=2018-01-13}}</ref> As of 2014, the organization had 133 full-time employees, up to 700 during major events, contributed $11 million annually to the City of Toronto, and attracted 5.3 million visitors annually to the site.

The area was an important portage route for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and the French wanted to capture their trade before they reached British posts to the south. It was burned by its garrison in 1759 after other French posts fell to the British on Lake Ontario.\n\nWhen the Town of [[York, Upper Canada|York]], the predecessor of Toronto, was inaugurated in the 1790s, the land to the east and west of the garrison (later [[Fort York]]) was reserved for military purposes. This includes all of today's Exhibition Place. Years later, the British military decided to replace Fort York with [[New Fort York]] (later the Stanley Barracks), to be located to the west of the existing fort. To finance this, the military sold the eastern half of the reserve. In 1840&ndash;1841, they constructed a series of six limestone buildings and several smaller ones. The fort was surrounded by a wood fence as elaborate defensive works were never built. The fort was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870, which named it [[Stanley Barracks]] in 1893.\n\n[[File:Crystal Palace 1871.jpg|thumb|The Palace of Industry, designed after the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in London, was erected for the 1858 fair.]]\n\nThe Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for [[Canada West]] inaugurated the [[Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West]] in 1846, to be held annually in different localities. For the 1858 fair, to be held in Toronto, a permanent \"Palace of Industry\" exhibition building, based on London's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], was built at [[King Street (Toronto)|King]] and Shaw Streets in what is now [[Liberty Village]]. The site held four more fairs until the 1870s when the City of Toronto government decided the exhibition had outgrown the site. The City signed a lease with the Government of Canada for a section of the western end of the reserve in April 1878. The Palace of Industry was moved to a site on the reserve near today's Horticulture Building, reconstructed and expanded. The City sold the King and Shaw site to the [[Massey Ferguson|Massey Manufacturing Company]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Torontoist |url=http://torontoist.com/2008/08/historicist_an_exhibition_in_crysta/ |title=Historicist: An Exhibition in Crystal |first=Jamie |last=Bradburn | date=August 23, 2008 |accessdate=October 28, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1878 Provincial Agricultural Fair was held on the grounds. When [[Ottawa]] was chosen to host the 1879 fair, Toronto decided to hold its own fair. First called the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, it was held in the Crystal Palace and temporary buildings. At first, the eastern part of the site was still reserved for military purposes, the exhibition held on the western part of the reserve, where many of the oldest exhibit buildings are located. As time went by, more and more of the reserve was taken over for exhibition purposes, including a horse track and grandstand, and exhibit buildings.\n\n===Development of permanent buildings===\n[[File:Dufferin Gate Toronto circa 1910.JPG|thumb|The Dufferin Gates were replaced with a more elaborate archway in 1910.]]\nIn 1902, after the Government of Canada announced it would sponsor a major exhibition at the site in 1903, the Toronto City Council decided to rebuild the exhibition site. In 1903, the Government of Canada reached an agreement to transfer the remaining military reserve to the City of Toronto. Under the agreement, military uses were permitted to continue until such time that replacement facilities were built. Included in this was Old Fort York, which the City committed to preserve.{{sfn|Sendzikas|2011|p=89}} The building campaign saw the building of fifteen permanent buildings designed by architect [[George Wallace Gouinlock|G. W. Gouinlock]] from 1903 until 1912, including the surviving Press Building, Horticulture Building, [[Government Building (Toronto)|Government Building]], Music Building and Fire Hall / Police Station. The new buildings were elaborately designed and set in an attractively landscaped site. At the conclusion of the building campaign, the name was officially changed to the Canadian National Exhibition. The five remaining buildings were declared a historic site in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=HistoricPlaces.ca |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=10470 |title=Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings National Historic Site of Canada |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the older buildings were lost to fire during this time, including the first Grandstand and the Crystal Palace (known as the Transportation Building) in 1906. In 1910, the Dufferin Gates were replaced with a more elaborate arch and out-buildings on each side. During World War I, the Government Building was used as a barracks for soldiers, and a tent camp was set up on the site of the current [[CNE Ontario Government Building|Ontario Government Building]] (now Liberty Grand). The Dufferin Gates were patrolled by soldiers.\n\nWhen the CNE became the world's largest annual fair in 1920, a 50-year plan was launched following the urban design and architectural precedents of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Osbaldeston|2008|pp=197\u2013198}} [[Chapman and Oxley]] prepared the 1920 plan, which emphasized [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] and [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] urban design. The Empire Court was to be a monumental central space with a triumphal arch and gates and monumental exhibition buildings with courtyards.\n[[File:Coliseum exterior photo ca 1922.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coca-Cola Coliseum|The Coliseum]] was opened in 1921 to host the [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]].]]\nDuring the 1920s, the exhibition grounds were expanded to the west and to the east, as well as to the south, where [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] was used to build [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] (originally \"Boulevard Drive\"), connecting downtown with Toronto's growing western suburbs. The Coliseum, to host the new [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]], was opened in 1921, followed by the Government of Ontario Building in 1926, the Princes' Gates in 1927, and the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1928. By the 1930s, the Beaux-Arts style faded in popularity. The start of the trend for a new style of architecture arguably became evident in the construction of the Automotive Building in 1929, the first building that moved away from the Beaux-Art architecture envisioned by the 1920 plan, mixing clean modern lines with classical ornamentation. In 1931, the [[Horse Palace]] was built, replacing temporary stables used for the Winter Fair. The Horse Palace used [[Art Deco]] ornamentation. In 1936, the Art Deco [[CNE Bandshell|Bandshell]] was constructed for open-air music concerts.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the exhibition grounds became Toronto's main military training grounds. The CNE, and virtually all other non-military uses of the lands ceased. The CNE was not held between 1942 and 1946, when the land and its facilities were turned over to the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] as a training ground. The Graphic Arts Building housed Red Cross facilities, the Coliseum became the RCAF Manning Depot, the Horse Palace was used for barracks and the Automotive Building became the shore facility HMCS ''York'' for the Royal Canadian Navy.<ref>''Structures'', episode ''CNE During World War 2'', Rogers TV, 2001</ref> After World War II, the buildings were used as a [[demobilization]] centre. The CNE would resume again in 1947, as the Canadian military returned the grounds back to its civilian administrators.\n\n=== Post World War II ===\nAfter the military vacated Stanley Barracks, the CNE made plans for the Barracks' demolition. However, until 1951, the buildings were used for emergency housing. The first phase of demolition in 1951 demolished all of the wooden buildings, leaving only the original stone buildings.{{sfn|Sendzikas|2011|pp=148-150}} In 1953, despite public opposition, three of the remaining four stone buildings were demolished for parking, leaving only the Officers' Quarters. In 1955, the Quarters found its first CNE use, for Sports Hall of Fame exhibits before being turned into a year-round Maritime Museum in 1959.{{sfn|Sendzikas|2011|pp=1548-155}}\n\nA new phase of building construction followed, replacing buildings destroyed by fire, demolished for the Gardiner Expressway, or needed expansions. The new buildings, mostly in the central block of the site, exhibited a new [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] style of architecture. In 1946, the third Grandstand burned down. In its place was built the fourth Grandstand, a massive concrete construction and monumental cantilevered steel roof was a sharp contrast to the other buildings around it. The Modernist trend continued with the construction of other buildings and monuments typifying the modernist style including the Food Building (1954), the Shell Oil Tower (1955), Queen Elizabeth Building (1957) and the Princess Margaret Fountain (1958).\n\nIn the later 1950s, the new six-lane Gardiner Expressway was pushed through the north side of the grounds, cut below grade in the western section of the grounds, and an elevated section in the eastern section. This necessitated the demolition of the Dufferin Gate, the Women's Rest building{{sfn|Lorimer|1973|p=102}} and the Machinery Hall. The new [[parabolic arch]] Dufferin Gate was built in 1959. \n[[File:Hall of Fame Facade.jpg|thumb|right|Remnant of Hall of Fame building facade at [[BMO Field]]. The building housed the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] from 1961 to 2006.]]\nOn January 3, 1961, the Manufacturer's Building and the Women's Building (the one built prior to the Queen Elizabeth Building) were destroyed by fire.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Toronto Star |title=Flames Turn CNE Landmark to Rubble |page=31 |date=January 4, 1961}}</ref> The buildings were replaced by the Better Living Centre, which came with a distinctive [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]-inspired ornament on its roof. In 1961, the Hall of Fame building opened north of the Grandstand to house [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] and the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. In 1963, the Coliseum was re-clad with a modernist south facade. To replace its exhibit in the Ontario Government Building, the Government of Ontario built Ontario Place on artificial islands to the south of Exhibition Place (accessible via two foot bridges).\n\nCoinciding with the opening of the ultra-modern Ontario Place to the south, a new master plan for the Exhibition site was developed in 1971. The 1971 Master Plan was radical, calling for the demolition of many pre-World War II buildings, new Modernist buildings, and a massive central public space with a reflecting pool and fountains on the site of Exhibition Stadium, which was to be relocated. The plan proposed the demolition of the Fire Station, Art Gallery, General Exhibits Building, Railways Building, Government Building, Ontario Government Building, Automotive Building, Transportation Building, Band Shell, Grandstand, Shell Tower and the 1959 Dufferin Gate.{{sfn|Lorimer|1973|p=118}} A monorail was proposed to move people around the site and to and from the parking lots. It had first been proposed to connect Union Station and the Exhibition Grounds. Dufferin Street was to be connected to Lake Shore Boulevard, a new four-lane road along the north of the site and a new 1800-place parking lot taking the place of buildings to the west of Dufferin.{{sfn|Lorimer|1973|p=118}}\n\n[[File:Blue Jays v White Sox 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Redeveloped [[Exhibition Stadium]] in 1977, during the second game played by the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].]]\n\nThe plan resulted in some demolition, such as the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1972 (allegedly in poor structural condition) and the General Exhibits Building and Art Gallery, which were in the path of the new road. In 1974, the International Building, (formerly the Transportation Building), to the west of the bandshell, burnt down. It was hosting an exhibit on [[Spain]] during the CNE when it caught fire and was destroyed. The building was demolished and not replaced, the site left vacant and has since used mostly as a parking lot. The 1971 plan was abandoned after Exhibition Stadium was redeveloped and enlarged to host [[Major League Baseball]] in 1977.{{sfn|Osbaldeston|2008|pp=203\u2013206}} The site officially became Exhibition Place, partly in recognition that very little of the site was retained as parklands.\n\nIn 1978, to celebrate the centenary of the fair, a copy of the original 1913 music bandstand was built on the site of the original in the park north of the Horticulture Building. North of the park a new structure designed to resemble the 1870s-era exhibition buildings was added.<ref name=tce-music>{{cite web |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-national-exhibition-emc/ |title=Music at the Canadian National Exhibition |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref> The buildings host mostly children's activities during the CNE.

The annual [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] race was first organized at the site in 1986.]]\nIn 1986, the streets were turned into a high-speed open-wheel car racing circuit for the first time. The race, known today as the Honda Indy Toronto, has taken place annually since, and is part of the [[IndyCar Series]]. The streets of Exhibition Place are closed off to regular traffic and a closed circuit is made through the grounds and along Lake Shore Boulevard. The race meant the end of the landmark Bulova/Shell Oil observation tower.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Torontoist |url=http://torontoist.com/2013/08/lets-go-to-the-ex-for-the-134th-time/slide/20130813shelltower/ |title=Let\u2019s Go to the Ex, for the 135th Time |first=Jamie |last=Bradburn |accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the Music Building, which had closed due to structural problems, was gutted by fire. The 1907 exterior was restored and a new interior was built.<ref name=tce-music/>\n\n===New emphasis on year-round use===\nIn the 1990s, budget pressures on the City of Toronto led to a new emphasis on the self-sufficiency of Exhibition Place. It saw the tear-down of the permanent midway buildings and the Flyer roller coaster. The City planned to charge rent to the midway's operator, Conklin Shows, which chose to tear down the buildings instead and set up temporary rides each year for the CNE.\n\n[[File:Ricohcoliseum.jpg|thumb|The [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], moved into [[Coca-Cola Coliseum]] in 2003.]]\n\nThe new National Trade Centre (now the Enercare Centre) trade show building, planned since the 1971 plan, was built on the vacant Electrical Building site to host more and larger trade shows year-round. It incorporated the Coliseum and Annex buildings to create one large exhibit space. In 2003, the Coliseum was rebuilt and expanded to provide a home for professional ice hockey. It is currently the home of the [[Toronto Marlies]] team from October to April each year.\n\nThe trend to utilize the grounds year-round to cover the grounds' expense, continued with the rental of the Arts & Crafts Building to the Medieval Times theatre company, the Ontario Government Building was rented to become event space known as \"Liberty Grand\", and the Horticulture Building became a night club known as \"Muzik.\" The Automotive Building was turned over to private management and is used exclusively for private events and conferences.\n\nIn 1999, Exhibition Stadium, mostly vacant after the opening of the downtown [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] stadium, was demolished. The site was vacant until 2007, when the new BMO Field soccer stadium, a public-private partnership, was built on the site to bring [[Major League Soccer]] to Toronto. The new soccer stadium also meant the end of the Hall of Fame building. The Hockey Hall of Fame had vacated earlier for downtown Toronto. A portion of the Hall of Fame facade was retained as one of the entrances to the new stadium. As a demonstration project, a [[WindShare]] [[wind turbine]] was built to the west of the Fort Rouill\u00e9 site.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the Exhibition Place grounds has seen several proposals for new uses. In July 2005, the City of Toronto asked for aquarium proposals from private enterprises. The only two respondents, [[Ripley Entertainment]] and Oceanus Holdings, suggested that they would be interested provided the location was closer downtown or had better transit access and parking. When the City of Toronto was considering the construction of a permanent casino, the CNE was the site of several proposals. The aquarium was built next to the CN tower and the City chose not to build a permanent casino.\n\nTwo new buildings have been added at Exhibition Place. In the north-west corner, the [[Toronto Raptors]] basketball team built a new practice facility which is shared part-time with the community. In the south-east, along Lake Shore Boulevard, the \"Hotel X\" hotel was constructed on the site of New Fort York. The foundations of several of the New Fort York buildings were revealed as part of the development. The hotel was built to complement the facilities of the Enercare and Allstream Centres. The soccer stadium was recently expanded, and adapted to allow it to host the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Toronto Argonauts]].\n\n===2015 Pan Am and Parapan Games===\n[[File:PanAmbeachvolleyball center.jpg|thumb|The [[Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre]] at Exhibition Place. The centre, along with other facilities at Exhibition Place was used as event venues for the [[2015 Pan Am Games]].]]\n\nIn July 2015, Exhibition Place was the site of sporting venues for the [[2015 Pan American Games]]. The collection of sites was referred to as \"CIBC Pan Am Park\" and each building was given a venue name. The Enercare Centre and Coliseum buildings were used for indoor sports, temporary facilities for beach volleyball were built south of BMO Field and a watercourse laid out on Lake Ontario. As a result of the games, the 2015 Toronto Honda Indy was scheduled in June to allow for time for the site to prepare for the Pan Am Games. As well the site was wound down in time for setup for the 2015 Canadian National Exhibition (scheduled to open August 21).\n\n==Buildings==\nWhile the CNE only lasts for a few weeks at the end of the summer, many major permanent buildings and other structures have been built over the years. Most are used for other purposes throughout the year.\n[[File:Stanley Barracks.jpg|thumb|left|Stanley Barracks Officers' Quarters. Erected in 1840, the building is the last remaining structure of [[New Fort York]], a military installation that was built at Exhibition Place.]]\nThe west end of the grounds is the original site of exhibitions and the oldest buildings are located here. There are five purpose-built fair buildings designed by architect G. W. Gouinlock: the Horticulture Building, built in 1907; the Government Building, built in 1912; the Music Building, built in 1907; the Administration Building, built in 1905; and the Fire Hall/Police Station, built in 1912. Just south of Dufferin Gate is Centennial Square, a green space with a bandstand. The Ontario Government Building was added later in 1926. The Bandshell, modeled after the famed Art Deco Hollywood Bowl was built in 1936, replacing a 1906 bandstand. North of the Bandshell is Bandshell Park, a large open green space for gatherings. Near the Bandshell is the 1790s [[Scadding Cabin]], the only building dating to the 1879 inaugural exhibition. There are two large fountains; the Princess Margaret Fountain and the Shrine Monument Fountain south of the Bandshell. To the west of Bandshell park, the former International Building site is now a parking lot, and there is a parking lot in the north-west corner of the site.\n\nThe central block contains more recent 1950-1960s buildings, which are all replacements for earlier buildings, and are larger than the buildings to the west: the Better Living Centre (exhibition space), the Queen Elizabeth Building complex (theatre, exhibition and administration sections) and the Food Building. The BMO Field soccer stadium, built in 2007, is situated on the site of the 1947 Grandstand and the 1961 Halls of Fame building. South of BMO Field is a large open parking lot and midway area. The CNE plans to make the area a public square, and move the parking underground. South of the central section are two pedestrian bridges over Lake Shore Boulevard to the Ontario Place complex.\n\nThe east block was the most active area of military usage and retains the only military building left on the site, the Stanley Barracks Officers' Quarters, dating to the 1840s. The area is a mix of buildings, including the older Coliseum, Horse Palace and newer buildings. The section is dominated by the exhibition complex of the Enercare Centre, Coliseum and the Industry Building. The Horse Palace (which adjoins the Coliseum and is used for equine shows and quartering), the Automotive Building (which was once used for car shows and is now a conference centre) and the General Services Building are all older exhibition buildings dating from the 1920s. The new \"Hotel X\" project includes a display of foundations of New Fort York which once occupied part of the site.\n\n===Sports venues===\nExhibition Place was also home to [[Exhibition Stadium]], which was built out of the fourth Grandstand by adding two extra wings of seats. The original grandstand had been constructed in the late 1800s and was re-modelled, replaced, or destroyed over the years. It served as home to the CFL's Toronto Argonauts between 1958 and 1988 and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (AL) between 1977 and 1989. The two teams left for SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) in 1989. After it lost many stadium concert tours to Rogers Centre, and many other outdoor concerts to the nearby [[Molson Amphitheatre]] at Ontario Place, its usefulness was at an end. The stadium was demolished in 1999 to serve as parking and allow a more sprawling midway. However, on October 26, 2005, the City of Toronto approved the construction of a 20,000 seat soccer stadium (BMO Field) on Exhibition Place land.\n\n==== Exhibition Stadium (former stadium) ====\n{{main|Exhibition Stadium}}\n[[File:Exhibition stadium.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Exhibition Stadium in 1992, several years before it was demolished.]]\nThe CNE has been host to four grandstands since its inception. The third grandstand, designed by G. W. Gouinlock, was built in 1907 and had a capacity of 16,000. It burned down in 1946, subsequently leading to the construction of the fourth (known as [[CNE Grandstand]]), built in 1948. Designed by [[architect]]s Marani and Morris, this building was the first of what would prove to be several [[Modernism|Modernist]] buildings built on the CNE grounds, its distinctive and bold cantilevered truss roof dominating the grounds for over 50 years. It initially housed 22,000 people, but was expanded over the years to a maximum of 54,000 in order to accommodate the additional seating required for major professional sports teams who made the Grandstand their home. It became the home base for the Toronto Argonauts football team, and later, to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. Architect Bill Sanford designed the alterations for baseball in 1976.\n\nA stock car race held on the grounds marked a historical race;  on July 18, 1958, [[Richard Petty]] made his NASCAR [[Grand National Series]] debut at Exhibition Stadium.\n\nIn addition to sports, CNE Grandstand was the stage for many entertainers over the years. Famous comedians who were featured there included [[Bob Hope]], [[Victor Borge]], and [[Bill Cosby]]. Similarly, many well-known musical acts made an appearance at the venue, ranging from [[Duke Ellington]], [[Guy Lombardo]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[The Beach Boys]] (appearing there 11 times between 1974 and 1990), [[The Monkees]], [[Sonny & Cher]], to [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[The Who]],  [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Tina Turner]]. After the grandstand was demolished, open-air concerts during the CNE have been held at the Bandshell.\n\nThe Blue Jays and Argos left the open-air Exhibition Stadium for the retractable roofed Skydome (now, the Rogers Centre) in 1989. By that time it was recognized that the building was beginning to visibly decay, and was little used in its final decade of existence. Though it was the earliest of the modernist-style buildings on the grounds, it was the only one not to be become a historically listed building. It was finally demolished in 1999.\n\n==== BMO Field (current stadium) ====\n{{main|BMO Field}}\n[[File:BMO Field in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Stadium|[[BMO Field]] is an outdoor field located at Exhibition Place.]]\nIn 2007, the open-air BMO Field [[soccer-specific stadium]] was constructed on the site of the former Exhibition Stadium and the Canada Sports Hall of Fame buildings. The Hall of Fame building had been vacated by the Hockey Hall of Fame and was demolished to make way for the stadium. The stadium was built to host [[Toronto FC]], the Major League Soccer (MLS) team as well as the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canadian national soccer team]]. Capacity is approximately 31,000 people. It opened on April 28, 2007, the start of the 2007 MLS season. Under the FIFA-sanctioned name \"National Soccer Stadium\", it was the center-piece venue for the 2007 [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. It was expanded for the 2015 season and had a new roof installed for the 2016 season. In conjunction with the stadium construction, Princes' Boulevard was re-routed to the south of the stadium.\n\n==== Coliseum ====\n{{main|Coca-Cola Coliseum}}\nThe Coliseum (1922, now part of the Enercare Centre complex) is an indoor arena. It is an example of Beaux-Arts design by City architect [[George F.W. Price]] and renovated by [[Brisbin Brook Beynon, Architects]]. Its main entrance was originally to the north, and the building was remodelled with a Modernist facade main entrance to the south in 1963. The original facade was restored when the Enercare Centre was built. It is home to the [[minor league]] Toronto Marlies professional ice hockey team during the winter months. Every November, it is used for the \"Royal Horse Show\" component of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair annually in November.\n\n==== OVO Athletic Centre ====\n{{main|OVO Athletic Centre}}\n[[File:OVO Athletic Centre Southeast 2019.jpg|thumb|The [[OVO Athletic Centre]] was completed in 2016.]]\nIn another partnership with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the new OVO Athletic Centre (originally known as the Biosteel Centre) was completed in 2016 at the west end of Exhibition Place on parking lot lands. The facility is a practice facility for the Toronto Raptors [[National Basketball Association]] team. It has two basketball courts. The facility displaced some parkland, including a [[baseball diamond]] on the site used for a CNE tournament.\n\n===Exhibit buildings===\n==== Better Living Centre ====\n[[File:BetterLivingCentre CNE-Grounds Aug25-05.jpg|thumb|left|The Better Living Centre is a [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] building opened in 1962.]]\nOne of the Modernist buildings on the site, the original purpose of the Better Living Centre was to introduce new ranges of consumer goods to the baby boomer generation, making it a \"space of encounter between consumer and product\". For many people attending the CNE, the building hosted their first encounters with such technologies as [[Color television#Color television|colour television]], [[transistor radio]]s or [[home computer]]s. It also became the place where people would expect to see the latest models of various consumer goods, ranging from [[vacuum cleaner]]s to kitchen appliances.\n\nThe building's stark modernist architecture, made up of large white forms, a vast flat roof and harsh angles, suited its futurist themes. The building was designed by [[architect]]s Marani, Morris and Allan{{sfn|Martins-Manteiga|2007|p=95}} and was opened by Toronto mayor [[Nathan Phillips (politician)|Nathan Phillips]] on August 17, 1962. It was built on the former site of the Manufacturers' building, which burned down in 1961. The new building replaced the exhibit space of the Manufacturers' Building and the General Exhibit Building.\n\nThe CNE no longer uses the Better Living Centre for its original purpose of introducing consumers to the latest and greatest products during the CNE. Instead, it has been divided in two. One-half hosts the CNE Casino for the month of August, while the other half is the \"Farm, Food and Fun\" pavilion during the CNE.\n\nThe building is used at other times of the year for special events. It hosts an indoor amusement park during March Break and a Hallowe'en exhibit \"Screamers\" during the month of October.\n\n====Enercare Centre====\n{{main|Enercare Centre}}\n[[File:DirectEnergyCentre3.jpg|thumb|right|The Enercare Centre is Canada's largest indoor exhibition hall.]]\nThe Enercare Centre (1997), along Princes' Boulevard,  has seven exhibit halls with one million square feet (90,000 m\u00b2) of space. The new building, first known as the National Trade Centre, took over the location of the old TTC streetcar loop and CNE entrance and the open space vacant since the Electrical and Engineering Building was demolished. It is interconnected with the [[Ricoh Coliseum]] and the Industry Building to the north to provide one large, configurable exhibition space. Home to the Toronto International Boat Show, the National Home Show, the One of A Kind Show, and the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Designed by architectural teams [[Zeidler Partnership Architects]] and [[Dunlop-Farrow Architects]]. During the exhibition, the building houses the international product displays and animal shows.\n\n====Food Building====\nThe Food Building (1954) was built to replace the original [[Pure Food Building]] (c. 1922 and demolished 1953). It was designed by [[Richard A. Fisher]].{{sfn|Martins-Manteiga|2007|p=85}} Water cascades down the windows of the east and west entrances to the building.

The theatre, which has 1300 seats, has been used for radio, variety, and fashion shows and hosts stage productions and concerts. The exhibition hall, which is a large uninterrupted exhibit space is used year-round and is home to arts, crafts, and hobbies displays during the CNE.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Exhibition Place |url=http://www.explace.on.ca/history/walking_tours.php |title=History - Walking Tour |accessdate=September 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906122050/http://www.explace.on.ca/history/walking_tours.php |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n====The Scadding Cabin====\n{{main|Scadding Cabin}}\nThis one-room cabin is located adjacent to the Fort Rouill\u00e9 Monument and the CNE Bandshell. It is not only the oldest building on the grounds, but the [[List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto|oldest building in Toronto]]. It was built by the [[The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) (RCAC)|Queen's York Rangers]] in 1794 on behalf of [[John Scadding]], who served as clerk (essentially, an executive assistant) to the first [[List of lieutenant governors of Ontario|lieutenant governor of Upper Canada]], [[John Graves Simcoe]]. The original cabin was disassembled from its original site and rebuilt by the York Pioneers, along with an adjacent cabin made out of new logs, on the current site, just in time for the original Toronto Industrial Exhibition in 1879.\n[[File:Scadding Cabin - CNE Grounds, Toronto (September 1 2005).jpg|thumb|left|[[Scadding Cabin]] is Toronto's oldest standing structure. Erected in 1794, it was moved to its present site in 1879.]]\nScadding was given a plot of land from what is now just north of Gerrard Street East, south to the waterfront. The cabin was built close to the Don River's east side, on what is now part of the [[Don Valley Parkway]], just south of [[Queen Street East]]. Scadding sold the property in 1818 to William Smith. In 1879, his son William Smith offered the cabin to the [[York Pioneers]], a local historical society. Around this time, someone mistook the information concerning the original owner for the cabin, leading to it being erroneously called \"The Governor Simcoe cabin\". John Scadding's youngest son, [[Henry Scadding]] wrote an early history of York/Toronto and set the record straight on who the original owner of the cabin was. When he died in 1901, the York Pioneers renamed it \"The Scadding Cabin\", in honour of this son of the original owner, who had also been a past president of their society.\n\nIt is a squat, two-storey [[log cabin]] with low ceilings, designed to retain the heat from the fire in winter close to its occupants. It is said that John Graves Simcoe, who was over {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, had to stoop in order to enter the building. The building as it now stands is little changed from its original construction. Apparently an additional {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} extension that would have appeared to the south of the building was not moved. The second cabin constructed next to it by the York Pioneers was built using wood that was too green, and it was demolished a few years after construction. Over the years some of the timbers have been replaced, and the cabin was remounted on a stone foundation in the late part of the 20th century. Inside the cabin are furnishings appropriate to a house in [[Upper Canada]] in the 1830s, and some known to have belonged to Simcoe.\n\n===Music and entertainment venues===\n\n==== Bandshell ====\n{{main|CNE Bandshell}}\n[[File:Toronto bandshell.jpg|thumb|The [[CNE Bandshell]] with a modern canopy extension in 2007.

Named after [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the original gate to the CNE grounds was named in his honour, situated at the bottom of [[Dufferin Street]], also named after the same person. The original gateway was erected in 1895, and was superseded by a more permanent, ornate Beaux-Arts style triumphal arch built in 1910, and officially re-opened by Lord Dufferin in 1914.\n\nWith the construction of Toronto's [[Gardiner Expressway]] in 1956, the gates were demolished in order to make way for the roadway.

The race is held annually in July.  In addition to the IndyCar race, several support races are held, including [[Indy Lights]] and the [[NASCAR Pinty's Series]], as well as vendor exhibits, concerts, and other off-track activities. The track layout uses local roads that wind through and around Exhibition Place and is commonly referred to as the \"Streets of Toronto\" circuit.

From the Start/Finish line, drivers head East towards the Princes' Gates, turning right (south) onto Canada Boulevard before reaching the gate.  From Canada Boulevard, the track goes right onto Lake Shore Boulevard (west) which comprises the longest straightaway on the circuit (this straightaway is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Shoreline Drive during race telecasts;  Shoreline Drive is the start-finish straight at the [[Grand Prix of Long Beach]]).  Drivers re-enter the Exhibition grounds at Ontario Drive, heading north towards Prince's Boulevard where they turn left (west).  The circuit continues on to Manitoba Drive and heads north-east then east until reaching Nova Scotia Avenue.  At Nova Scotia Avenue, drivers turn right (south) then navigate a left-right-left series of turns until rejoining Prince's Boulevard and heading east towards the start/finish line.\n\nExhibition Place is one of seven Canadian circuits to have held an Indy/Champ Car race, the others being [[Canadian Tire Motorsport Park|Mosport]], [[Molson Indy Vancouver|Concord Pacific Place]] in [[Vancouver]], [[Edmonton Indy|Edmonton City Centre Airport]], [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] in [[Montreal]], [[Circuit Mont-Tremblant]], and [[Sanair Super Speedway]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transportation==\n===Public transit===\n[[File:509 Harbourfront CLRV Eastbound.jpg|thumb|[[Exhibition Loop]] serves as a terminus for several [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar routes]].]]\nThe grounds are well-connected to city and regional public transit systems.

Exhibition Place is also connected to city transit by the [[Toronto streetcar system]]'s [[509 Harbourfront|Harbourfront]] and [[511 Bathurst|Bathurst Street]] lines at the [[Exhibition Loop]] terminus, connecting Exhibition Place with Toronto [[rapid transit|subway]] system's [[Bathurst (TTC)|Bathurst]] and [[Union (TTC)|Union]] stations. The grounds are also served by the Dufferin bus (routes 29 and 929), which loops through Exhibition Place most of the year and terminating at the [[Dufferin Gate Loop]] terminus during the CNE and the rest of the year. Routes 29 and 929 connects with the subway's [[Dufferin (TTC)|Dufferin]] station on [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]].\n\nThe first streetcar terminus began operations in 1916 and was located at the current loop location along Manitoba Drive, north of the Coliseum. In 1923, the loop was relocated to the south of the Coliseum. To accommodate the construction of the National Trade Centre, it was re-located back to the original location in 1996.\n\n===Roads and gates===\n[[File:Toronto - ON - Princes' Gates.jpg|thumb|View of Princes' Boulevard looking eastward towards Princes' Gates.]]\n'''Princes' Boulevard''' starts at the Princes' Gate and extends west to the south of BMO Field and continues west to the Princess Margaret Fountain.

'''Fort Rouill\u00e9 Street''', of which a stub still exists north of the rail tracks, once extended into the Exhibition grounds to the lake shore. The street was cut off by the construction of the rail cut to move the rail lines below grade.

It was deployed to have powers to perform covert operations behind enemy lines for intelligence gathering and command operations. Due to the changed military situation after the 1990s, in 1992, their name changed to \"Maroon Berets\" (Turkish: ''Bordo Bereliler''). Its current color and name comes from designator of the new unit, [[Ka\u015fif Kozino\u011flu]] which was fan of Turkish football club [[Trabzonspor]].<ref>https://www.haber61.net/spor/neden-bordo-bereli-oldular-h101683.html</ref>\n\nThe OKK came into the public spotlight when they captured the PKK terrorist organization leader [[Abdullah \u00d6calan]] in [[Kenya]]. The identities of MB personal is classified. Unlike other special operations teams, MB Officers are battle hardened and are constantly operating and are active in the war on the PKK in the southeastern Iraqi border region of Turkey and even cross-border action into Northern Iraq.\n\n===Role in [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]]===\nA key figure of the coup was brigadier general [[Semih Terzi]], who was Deputy Commander of the Special Forces at the time and the highest ranking field commander during the coup attempt. He led a team of roughly 40 special forces operatives in an attempt to secure Special forces Headquarters and organize attacks against government agencies and the parliament. The attempt ended in failure, when senior master sergeant [[\u00d6mer Halisdemir]], a noncommissioned officer (NCO) with the Turkish military's Special Forces Command (OKK), shot and killed Semih Terzi, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.<ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/coup-plotters-targeted-turkish-president-with-daring-helicopter-raid-1468786991</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/who-killed-turkish-hero-stopped-coup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202071629/https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/who-killed-turkish-hero-stopped-coup.html |archivedate=2018-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe Special Forces are not aligned to any of the three branches of the TAF, receiving its orders directly from the [[General Staff of the Republic of Turkey]].<ref name=\"sabah\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/gundem/onlar_tsknin_bel_kemigi?albumId=20579&tc=35&page=8|title=Onlar TSK&#39;n\u0131n bel kemi\u011fi - Sayfa 8 Sabah - Fotohaber - G&#252;ndem - 05 Eyl&#252;l 2015 Cumartesi|publisher=sabah.com.tr|accessdate=2015-09-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006072457/http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/gundem/onlar_tsknin_bel_kemigi?albumId=20579&tc=35&page=8|archivedate=2015-10-06}}</ref> Although considered a brigade-level formation, as of 2017, this includes non-combatant units and administrative duties personnel as well, the combatant size of the OKK is not greater than 500.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/tu-army-okk.htm</ref> The Maroon Berets, along with Su Alt\u0131 Taarruz ([[Underwater Offence]]) and Su Alt\u0131 Savunma ([[Underwater Defence (Turkish Armed Forces)|Underwater Defence]]), is one of three special units of the Turkish military.\n\n===Combat Search and Rescue (''M.A.K.'')<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/tu-army-okk.htm</ref>===\nDespite the units name Combat Search and Rescue (''Muharebe Arama Kurtarma - M.A.K.''), its duties aren't limited to [[search and rescue]], but also focuses on unconventional warfare and military intelligence.

The [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] club finished the season in its best-ever position in third place, and in an effort to keep hold of him, bought up 75% of his rights from Barcelona for up to \u20ac8&nbsp;million, depending on Villarreal performance in the next two seasons.

The negotiations stalled when Villarreal's counteroffered to sell Riquelme only in exchange for \u20ac4&nbsp;million, Rodrigo Palacio and half the rights to either [[Mauro Boselli]] or [[Jonathan Maidana]], terms which were rejected by Boca.

He was given the number 16 shirt for the [[2007\u201308 La Liga|2007\u201308 season]]. Then, on 26 November 2007, Riquelme reached an agreement with Villarreal to allow his re-joining Boca Juniors when the next transfer window re-opened, in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=626379.html |title=Riquelme set to return home |publisher=Uefa.com |date= |accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoca opted to pay Villarreal US$15&nbsp;million to purchase Riquelme, while Villarreal would pay Riquelme's salary on behalf of Boca Juniors for remainder of the 2007\u201308 playing season, which was approximately \u20ac3&nbsp;million. The deal was the most expensive fee paid to an Argentine for its respective player in history. Riquelme subsequently signed a contract lasting from the end of 2007 to 2010. He was unable to participate in the [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]] as he was not registered by [[FIFA]] in time to be able to compete at the tournament.\n\nDuring the entire [[2007\u201308 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n season]], Riquelme would only go on to make ten league appearances and score one league goal. His first match of 2007\u201308 came in a 1\u20131 draw against Rosario Central during the 2008 Torneo Clausura.

2011|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> An [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] for 11 years, Riquelme represented the nation at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and two [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] tournaments, reaching the final in the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2007]] edition; he also participated in the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|2005 Confederations]] with Argentina, reaching the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup Final|final]], and he led his country as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] to win a Gold medal at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early years===\nRiquelme was born as the eldest of 11 children in a poor family, one day before Argentina won the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. He began playing football in the localities of San Fernando, playing for different local clubs, before gaining the opportunity to trial with the junior teams of [[Argentinos Juniors]]. After trialling, he was signed by the club where he began playing as a central midfielder. [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] spotted him when he was a youth player for [[Argentinos Juniors]]. In 1995, however, Riquelme was transferred from Argentinos Juniors U-20 to Boca Juniors U-20 for a fee of [[United States dollar|US$]]800,000, during an operation insisted by trainer Carlos Salvador Bilardo which led to the then president of Boca Juniors, Mauricio Macri, establishing various purchases of Argentinos Juniors youth players.\n\n===Boca Juniors===\nOn 10 November 1996, aged 18, Riquelme made his [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] debut in a 2\u20130 win against [[Uni\u00f3n de Santa Fe]]. Two weeks later, he scored his first senior goal in a 6\u20130 triumph over [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]].\n\n===Barcelona===\nIn July 2002, after seven successful seasons with Boca Juniors which brought him and the club six major titles, including the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[Copa Libertadores]] in 2000, Riquelme was transferred to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in [[Spain]] for a reported [[Euro|\u20ac]]11&nbsp;million transfer fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=44002.html|title=Bar\u00e7a take up Riquelme option|publisher=UEFA|date=26 November 2002|accessdate=}}</ref> Shortly before his departure, his brother, Cristian, was kidnapped; Riquelme negotiated for his brother's release and eventually paid the ransom, later stating this was one of the reasons why he chose to leave Boca.\n\nBar\u00e7a manager [[Louis van Gaal]] described Riquelme as a \"political signing\"<ref name=\"go-to man\">{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1800201,00.html|title=Lonesome Riquelme is the go-to man|work=The Guardian|first=Jason|last=Cowley|date=18 June 2006|accessdate=12 August 2006|location=London}}</ref> and treated him with indifference. When the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] did play him, he did so rarely, deploying him as a [[Right winger|winger]]. Thus, the player was unable to find his form during a period of largely substitute appearances, losing his place in the first team. He played mainly \u2013 as a starter \u2013 in the [[Copa del Rey]], and netted the game's only goal in a rare [[UEFA Champions League]] starting opportunity, at [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] in the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|group stage]].\n\n===Villarreal===\n[[File:JR Riquelme.jpg|Riquelme, with [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] and [[Sebasti\u00e1n Viera]], during a training session with Villarreal in 2005.|thumb|right|215px]]\nWhen Barcelona signed [[Ronaldinho]], the club exceeded the maximum foreign players that Spanish teams were allowed, prompting Riquelme's two-year loan move to Villarreal. There, he played alongside three compatriots: [[Rodolfo Arruabarrena]], [[Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez (Argentine footballer)|Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Juan Pablo Sor\u00edn]].\n\nAt the end of the [[2004\u201305 La Liga|2004\u201305 season]], Spanish sports newspaper ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' awarded Riquelme with the title of Most Artistic Player, also earning himself a nomination for the 2005 [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award after scoring a career-best 15 goals in 35 games. The [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] club finished the season in its best-ever position in third place, and in an effort to keep hold of him, bought up 75% of his rights from Barcelona for up to \u20ac8&nbsp;million, depending on Villarreal performance in the next two seasons. Villarreal also gave Riquelme a four-year contract extension,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=308912.html|title=Riquelme leaves Bar\u00e7a for good|publisher=UEFA.com|date=21 June 2005|accessdate=21 June 2005}}</ref> with the caveat that 25% of any subsequent transfer fee would be provided to ''Bar\u00e7a'' should Villarreal sell him.\n\nA peculiar contract situation arose when, on 7 December 2005, Villarreal beat [[Ligue 1|French]] club [[Lille OSC|Lille]] 1\u20130 to [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|win its Champions League group]], knocking out English giants [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and advancing to the knockout stages in the club's debut season in the main continental competition. Because of a clause in the transfer contract with Barcelona, Villarreal had to pay \u20ac1&nbsp;million to the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] club. Additionally, the contract included two other \"\u20ac1&nbsp;million clauses\": One if Villarreal finished in one of the top four league positions in [[2005\u201306 La Liga|2005\u201306]], and an identical clause for [[2006\u201307 La Liga|the following season]].\n\nOn 25 April 2006, as Villarreal reached the last-four in the Champions League, in the second leg against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Jens Lehmann]] saved a Riquelme [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] that would have taken the match to [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].

Riquelme scored in the 23rd minute, Boca's second goal of the match in an eventual 3\u20130 home victory. Boca finished in second position of their respective group with ten points, advancing to the knockout stages of the competition.\n\nDuring the [[2007 Copa Libertadores knockout stages|knockout stages]] of the competition, Boca faced [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]] in the round of 16 fixtures. During the first leg on 2 May 2007, Riquelme scored in the first minute as Boca claimed a 3\u20130 home victory.

During the second-leg of the quarter-finals, played on 24 May 2007, Riquelme scored Boca's first goal in the 61st minute of the match as they claimed a 2\u20130 away victory and a 3\u20131 aggregate result, ensuring progression to the semi-finals. During Boca's second-leg semi-final fixture against Colombia's [[C\u00facuta Deportivo]] on 7 June 2007, Riquelme scored a 44th-minute free kick, scoring Boca's first goal of their 3\u20130 home victory.

During the second half, Riquelme scored the 2\u20130 goal in 73rd-minute through a free-kick, with Boca eventually winning 3\u20130 at home. In the second leg, played away on 20 June, Riquelme scored a second-half double to give Boca Juniors a 2\u20130 victory and their sixth Copa Libertadores title. Boca Juniors therefore qualified for the [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]], and Riquelme was awarded as the competition's Most Valuable Player.\n\n[[File:Riquelme 2009.jpg|150px|thumb|Riquelme training with [[Boca Juniors]] in 2009.]]\n\n====2007\u201308 season====\nIn August 2007, it was reported that Boca had given up hope of re-signing Riquelme. A few days later, however, the situation changed, with Boca director Juan Carlos Crespi expressing confidence in the player's return \"within 10 days\". The negotiations stalled when Villarreal's counteroffered to sell Riquelme only in exchange for \u20ac4&nbsp;million, Rodrigo Palacio and half the rights to either [[Mauro Boselli]] or [[Jonathan Maidana]], terms which were rejected by Boca. On 30 August 2007, however, it was announced Riquelme had been signed by [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] for a fee of \u20ac8&nbsp;million, though the deal fell through at the last minute, leaving Riquelme a Villarreal player. He was given the number 16 shirt for the [[2007\u201308 La Liga|2007\u201308 season]]. Then, on 26 November 2007, Riquelme reached an agreement with Villarreal to allow his re-joining Boca Juniors when the next transfer window re-opened, in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=626379.html |title=Riquelme set to return home |publisher=Uefa.com |date= |accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoca opted to pay Villarreal US$15&nbsp;million to purchase Riquelme, while Villarreal would pay Riquelme's salary on behalf of Boca Juniors for remainder of the 2007\u201308 playing season, which was approximately \u20ac3&nbsp;million. The deal was the most expensive fee paid to an Argentine for its respective player in history. Riquelme subsequently signed a contract lasting from the end of 2007 to 2010. He was unable to participate in the [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]] as he was not registered by [[FIFA]] in time to be able to compete at the tournament.\n\nDuring the entire [[2007\u201308 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n season]], Riquelme would only go on to make ten league appearances and score one league goal. His first match of 2007\u201308 came in a 1\u20131 draw against Rosario Central during the 2008 Torneo Clausura. On 4 May 2008, he assisted [[Sebasti\u00e1n Battaglia]] in scoring Boca's only goal in their 1\u20130 home victory in the ''[[Supercl\u00e1sico]]'' with River Plate. Riquelme had taken a corner which was played to Battaglia, who headed the ball into the net in the 14th minute. During Boca's last [[2008 Copa Libertadores]] group-stage fixture against [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo|Maracaibo]] on 22 April 2008, Riquelme assisted defender [[Gabriel Paletta]] in scoring Boca's first goal when his free-kick was played towards Paletta, who headed the ball into the net in the tenth minute. Riquelme then scored Boca's third goal in the 74th minute with a close-ranged chip as Boca claimed a 3\u20130 home victory and finished in second position of their respective group, qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition.\n\nDuring the first-leg of the round of 16 stage on 30 April 2008, Riquelme side footed the ball into the net in the sixth minute after receiving a pass from [[\u00c1lvaro Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez|\u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez]]. Boca went on to win the match 2\u20131 and eventually claimed a 4\u20132 aggregate win. The club then faced [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] in the semi-final stages. In the first leg on 28 May 2008, Riquelme scored in the 12th minute of the match to give Boca a 1\u20130 lead after receiving a pass from Rodrigo Palacio, who played the ball across goal for Riquelme to convert. In the 65th minute, Riquelme scored from a free-kick which gave Boca a 2\u20131 lead before Fluminense again equalized. The second leg saw Fluminense defeat Boca Juniors 3\u20131, eliminating the Argentine side 5\u20133 on aggregate. Riquelme had scored four goals in the competition.\n\n====2008\u201309 season====\nIn October 2008, Boca Juniors centre-back [[Julio C\u00e9sar C\u00e1ceres]] had a very public conflict with his teammate Riquelme, when during an interview on a Paraguayan radio station in [[Asunci\u00f3n]], during his training with his national team, C\u00e1ceres questioned Riquelme's motivation. He claimed that, \"In some matches, he is apparently running and in others he is passive. He seems to be mentally saturated. He seems to have more motivation when he plays for his country.\" Riquelme responded by saying, in a telephone interview on the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports cable channel]], \"He doesn't know what I feel for the club. I take part in pre-match concentration just like the other players and I didn't have a holiday because I chose to play in the [Olympic] Games.

It features improved processing speed, improved graphics rendering, and a new revision of the operating system. It is the successor to the [[Amiga 2000]].\n\nIts predecessors, the [[Amiga 500]], [[Amiga 1000|1000]] and [[Amiga 2000|2000]], share the same fundamental system architecture and consequently perform without much variation in processing speed despite considerable variation in purchase price.
