{"title_page": "Noah Dietrich", "text_new": "{{short description|American business executive and associate of Howard R. Hughes}}\n'''Noah Dietrich''' (February 28, 1889 \u2013 February 15, 1982) was an American businessman, who was the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Howard Hughes]] business empire from 1925 to 1957.<ref name=obit/> (Even though these dates have been recorded as the official period of employment, Noah Dietrich continued to oversee and make executive decisions for the Hughes industries as late as 1970.) According to his own memoirs, he left the Hughes operation over a dispute involving putting more of his income on a [[capital gain]]s basis. The manuscript of his eventual memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', may have been a key, if inadvertent, source of novelist [[Clifford Irving]]'s infamous fake autobiography of Hughes.\n\n==Early life==\nDietrich was born on February 28, 1889 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of German-born evangelical [[Lutheran]] minister John Dietrich, and the former Sarah Peters.<ref>[http://www.noahdietrich.com/bio.html] \"Noah Dietrich was born February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin and was the fourth of six children born to Sarah Peters and German-born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich.\"</ref> He graduated from Janesville High School in 1906, married in 1910, and became a [[bank cashier]] in [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] for the next six months.  They then moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he became an [[auditor]] for the Los Angeles Suburban Land Co., and then the Janass Investment Co.  In 1917, he became an assistant [[comptroller]] for [[Edward L. Doheny]] Oil companies in [[New York City]].  Then Noah, along with his family now consisting of his wife and two daughters, decided to  move back to Los Angeles, where he worked for the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firm of Haskins and Sells. There he passed the [[California Board of Accountancy]] exam in 1923.<ref name=obit/><ref name=\"Noah\">{{cite book |last1=Dietrich |first1=Noah |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |title=Howard, The Amazing Mr. Hughes |date=1972 |publisher=Fawcett Publications, Inc. |location=Greenwich |pages=26-29}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===\"Noah Can Do It\"===\nIn Nov. 1925, at the age of 36, Dietrich met 19-year-old Hughes, who had gained control of [[Hughes Tool Company]] after buying out the other family heirs. Started by his father, [[Howard R. Hughes, Sr.]], Hughes Tool Company&nbsp;\u2013 or Toolco \u2013 manufactured oil drilling equipment, especially the multiple-edge, revolving-teeth roller cutter [[well drilling|drill bits]] the elder Hughes invented.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13-14,22-23,29-30}}\n\nHughes, according to Dietrich, was \"looking for someone with wide general knowledge,\" \"Someone who is resourceful and can solve problems.\"  Questions Hughes asked Dietrich included \"how a battleship finds the range on its target?\", and to \"Explain the principles of the internal combustion engine,\" both of which Dietrich was able to answer satisfactorily.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|23-24}}\n\nDietrich was hired as an executive assistant to explain the production and financial reports issued by Hughes' tool company, eventually becoming Hughes' personal delegate. In his memoir, Dietrich observed that Hughes had little interest in Toolco, other than as a source of revenue. \"The tool company,\" he quoted Hughes as saying, \"was my father's success. And it always will be.\"  The company's earnings, however, allowed Hughes to pursue his interest in Hollywood movies.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|33,76}}\n\nWhen still in his early twenties, Hughes told Dietrich, \"My first objective is to become the world's number one golfer. Second, the top aviator, and third I want to become the world's most famous motion picture producer. Then, I want you to make me the richest man in the world.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|73}} \n\nIn time, Dietrich came to serve as an executive for most of Hughes' enterprises, including [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA),<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|147}} [[RKO Pictures]]<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|237}} and [[Hughes Aircraft]].<ref name=obit/><ref name=Noah/>{{rp|255,257}}\n\nDietrich became Hughes' most indispensable executive&nbsp;\u2013 \"Noah can do it\" was, according to Dietrich's memoir, a frequent Hughes expression whenever difficult, if not impossible, wants or needs needed to be met. Some&nbsp;\u2013 such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home&nbsp;\u2013 were merely difficult.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13}} Others&nbsp;\u2013 such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during [[Prohibition]]&nbsp;\u2013 put him at serious risk.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|90-99}}\n\nDietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus.  Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax.  All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses.  Hughes even said of Dietrich, \"He knows more about my business than I do,\" referring to Noah as a \"genius\".<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|102-104,147,192,254}}\n\nSome of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich&nbsp;\u2013 who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself&nbsp;\u2013 \"of hiding his body and running things\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]] aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|178-181,194-195}}\n\nIn 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco.  Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|190-191}}\n\nDietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of [[Hughes Aircraft]] following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous [[flying boat]], the ''Hercules'', a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]&nbsp;\u2013 whose president, [[Juan Trippe]], had implored Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] to carry it&nbsp;\u2013 pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nDietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him&nbsp;\u2013 and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|207-208}}\n\nBy 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \"immensely onerous\", \"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|253}}\n\n===Falling out with Hughes===\nThough Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder.  Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|22,254,262}}\n\nIn 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership.  At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes.  Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan&nbsp;\u2013 on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit&nbsp;\u2013 stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \"Noah, I can't exist without you!\")<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|15-19,293-294}}\n\nHughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office\u2013 a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships.  Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|295-298}}\n\n===Post-Hughes career and memoirs===\nAfter parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich, as a well-respected financial and executive advisor, served on several corporate and financial boards as well as traveling to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]] (the same illness that killed shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]), did Dietrich finally retire in full.\n\nDietrich wrote of Hughes, \"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him.  He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth.  Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker.

Hughes}}\n'''Noah Dietrich''' (February 28, 1889 \u2013 February 15, 1982) was an American businessman, who was the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Howard Hughes]] business empire from 1925 to 1957.<ref name=obit/> (Even though these dates have been recorded as the official period of employment, Noah Dietrich continued to oversee and make executive decisions for the Hughes industries as late as 1970.) According to his own memoirs, he left the Hughes operation over a dispute involving putting more of his income on a [[capital gain]]s basis. The manuscript of his eventual memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', may have been a key, if inadvertent, source of novelist [[Clifford Irving]]'s infamous fake autobiography of Hughes.\n\n==Early life==\nDietrich was born on February 28, 1889 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of German-born evangelical [[Lutheran]] minister John Dietrich, and the former Sarah Peters.<ref>[http://www.noahdietrich.com/bio.html] \"Noah Dietrich was born February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin and was the fourth of six children born to Sarah Peters and German-born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich.\"</ref> He graduated from Janesville High School in 1906, married in 1910, and became a [[bank cashier]] in [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] for the next six months.  They then moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he became an [[auditor]] for the Los Angeles Suburban Land Co., and then the Janass Investment Co.  In 1917, he became an assistant [[comptroller]] for [[Edward L. Doheny]] Oil companies in [[New York City]].  Then Noah, along with his family now consisting of his wife and two daughters, decided to  move back to Los Angeles, where he worked for the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firm of Haskins and Sells. There he passed the [[California Board of Accountancy]] exam in 1923.<ref name=obit/><ref name=\"Noah\">{{cite book |last1=Dietrich |first1=Noah |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |title=Howard, The Amazing Mr. Hughes |date=1972 |publisher=Fawcett Publications, Inc. |location=Greenwich |pages=26-29}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===\"Noah Can Do It\"===\nIn Nov. 1925, at the age of 36, Dietrich met 19-year-old Hughes, who had gained control of [[Hughes Tool Company]] after buying out the other family heirs. Started by his father, [[Howard R. Hughes, Sr.]], Hughes Tool Company&nbsp;\u2013 or Toolco \u2013 manufactured oil drilling equipment, especially the multiple-edge, revolving-teeth roller cutter [[well drilling|drill bits]] the elder Hughes invented.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13-14,22-23,29-30}}\n\nHughes, according to Dietrich, was \"looking for someone with wide general knowledge,\" \"Someone who is resourceful and can solve problems.\"  Questions Hughes asked Dietrich included \"how a battleship finds the range on its target?\", and to \"Explain the principles of the internal combustion engine,\" both of which Dietrich was able to answer satisfactorily.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|23-24}}\n\nDietrich was hired as an executive assistant to explain the production and financial reports issued by Hughes' tool company, eventually becoming Hughes' personal delegate. In his memoir, Dietrich observed that Hughes had little interest in Toolco, other than as a source of revenue. \"The tool company,\" he quoted Hughes as saying, \"was my father's success. And it always will be.\"  The company's earnings, however, allowed Hughes to pursue his interest in Hollywood movies.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|33,76}}\n\nWhen still in his early twenties, Hughes told Dietrich, \"My first objective is to become the world's number one golfer. Second, the top aviator, and third I want to become the world's most famous motion picture producer. Then, I want you to make me the richest man in the world.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|73}} \n\nIn time, Dietrich came to serve as an executive for most of Hughes' enterprises, including [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA),<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|147}} [[RKO Pictures]]<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|237}} and [[Hughes Aircraft]].<ref name=obit/><ref name=Noah/>{{rp|255,257}}\n\nDietrich became Hughes' most indispensable executive&nbsp;\u2013 \"Noah can do it\" was, according to Dietrich's memoir, a frequent Hughes expression whenever difficult, if not impossible, wants or needs needed to be met. Some&nbsp;\u2013 such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home&nbsp;\u2013 were merely difficult.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|13}} Others&nbsp;\u2013 such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during [[Prohibition]]&nbsp;\u2013 put him at serious risk.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|90-99}}\n\nDietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus.  Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax.  All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses.  Hughes even said of Dietrich, \"He knows more about my business than I do,\" referring to Noah as a \"genius\".<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|102-104,147,192,254}}\n\nSome of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich&nbsp;\u2013 who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself&nbsp;\u2013 \"of hiding his body and running things\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]] aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|178-181,194-195}}\n\nIn 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco.  Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|190-191}}\n\nDietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of [[Hughes Aircraft]] following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous [[flying boat]], the ''Hercules'', a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]&nbsp;\u2013 whose president, [[Juan Trippe]], had implored Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] to carry it&nbsp;\u2013 pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nDietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him&nbsp;\u2013 and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|207-208}}\n\nBy 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \"immensely onerous\", \"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|253}}\n\n===Falling out with Hughes===\nThough Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder.  Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|22,254,262}}\n\nIn 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership.  At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes.  Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan&nbsp;\u2013 on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit&nbsp;\u2013 stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \"Noah, I can't exist without you!\")<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|15-19,293-294}}\n\nHughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office\u2013 a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships.  Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|295-298}}\n\n===Post-Hughes career and memoirs===\nAfter parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich served on several corporate and financial boards as a well-respected financial and executive adviser, as well as traveling to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]] (the same illness that killed shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]]), did Dietrich finally retire in full.\n\nDietrich wrote of Hughes, \"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him.  He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth.  Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker.  RKO was a heady diversion, an opportunity to pursue his sensual enjoyments.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|290}}\n\n==Personal life==\nBy 1936, he had divorced his first wife, and their two daughters were married.  By 1945, Dietrich had three children with his second wife.  By 1951, Dietrich was separated from his second wife.  After leaving Hughes in 1957, Dietrich married for a third time.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|140,188,257-258,301}}\n\nIn his book ''Howard'', Dietrich wrote, \"I much preferred the more exciting life,\" rather than the sedate life of a CPA.  He wrote the book \"to leave, for my children and grandchildren, a record of the role I played in a colorful subchapter of American history,\" and in part, so \"the American public should be informed on the uses and misuses of great wealth.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|11}}\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905773-1,00.html \"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\"], ''Time''</ref> revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost-written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail.

His works include ''[[Karma Incorporated]]'' and ''[[Emily Edison]]'' from publisher [[Viper Comics]], ''[[Astronaut Dad]]'', and a comic book adaptation of ''[[Antigone]]'' with frequent collaborator artist [[Tom Kurzanski]]. He writes a regular comic feature for [[D Magazine]] called ''[[Souvenir of Dallas]]'' with artist [[Paul Milligan]].  David is a contributor to the Smart Pop Series from [[BenBella Books]].  He is the co-host and co-producer of [[Fanboy Radio]]'s Indie Show, that showcases independent and small press comics. David lives in Arlington, Texas with his daughter Kennedy.\n\n== Career ==\nDavid Hopkins first professional writing was after college in 2002. Aja Jones asked him to write a stage play for her theatre troupe to be performed at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. The only performance of \"Space to Occupy\" was on September 14, 2002. Immediately afterwards, Hopkins began writing comics.\n\nThe first year, Hopkins wrote a five issue series ''The Insight''. Set in Dallas, Hopkins used extensive photo references from actual locations in the city. (He would later do this for [[Karma Incorporated]], which also takes place in Dallas.) Over the course of two years, there were two different artists attached to the project, which never came together and remains unpublished.\n\nIn June 2003, Hopkins wrote a 144-page graphic novel ''Astronaut Dad''\u2014a fictional story about three astronaut families living in Houston, set in 1963. Hopkins cites this work as his \"most personally satisfying\". It is set to be published by [[Silent Devil Productions]].\n\nLater that year, encouraged by the Isotope Awards, Hopkins self-published a mini-comic \"Some Other Day\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312100406/http://antiherocomics.com/sod_1.htm] with artist [[Brian Kelly (artist)|Brian Kelly]].\n\nIn 2004, Hopkins' first published work was a short story in [[Viper Comics]] ''[[Dead@17]]: Rough Cut''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060908160931/http://www.vipercomics.com/features_rc.asp].

In addition to the standard blue cover of issue one, a red exclusive [[variant cover]] was printed as part of the [[Diamond Comic Distributors Inc.|Diamond Distributors]] exclusives for that year. A second series was approved, but never completed.\n\nHopkins wrote ''Emily Edison'', which was published by [[Viper Comics]] in 2006, and illustrated by [[Brock Rizy]].

Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936\u201358). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for \"the [[sabre]]\".\n\n==History of model==\nThe LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],<ref>Flory,  J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021.</ref> which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.\n\nIn addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.\n\n[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]\nFrom 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an \"economy\" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a \"no cost\" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost \"economy\" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964\u201365), 340 (1966\u201367) and 350 (1968\u201376). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.\n\nFor most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.\n\nLeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.\n\n==First generation (1959\u20131960)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = File:59 LeSabre 06-15-2019 Queen Street Cruise.jpg\n| caption = 1959 Buick LeSabre four-door hardtop\n| name = First generation\n| model_years = 1959\u20131960\n| related = [[Pontiac Catalina]]<br>[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br>[[Buick Invicta]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br>[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Super 88]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Dynamic 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br>[[Pontiac Parisienne]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Star Chief]]<br>[[Pontiac Strato Chief]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Ventura]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />2-speed automatic\n| engine = {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n\n'''1959'''\n\nLeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959\u201360). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and \"Delta-wing\" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. \n[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]\nWhile Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed \"Triple Turbine\" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.\n\n'''1960'''\n[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]\nThe 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new \"Tri-Shield\" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]\" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were \"four-holers\".\n\nInside, a revised instrument panel featured a \"Mirromatic\" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.\n\n{{-}}\n{{anchor|second}}\n\n==Second generation (1961\u20131964)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name= Second generation\n | model_years    = 1961\u20131964\n | layout= [[FR layout]]\n|image='64 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg\n | engine={{unbulleted list | {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|''Small-Block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#364|''Nailhead'']] V8 | {{convert|401|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#401|''Nailhead'']] V8 }}\n | body_style= 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | transmission= {{unbulleted list | 3/4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] | 2/3-speed automatic }}\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n'''1961'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]\nLeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}} but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.\n\nInside were revised instrument panels retaining the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.<ref name=\"buick\">{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 106\u2013107 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}</ref>\n\nEngines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.<ref name=\"buick\"/>\n\n'''1962'''\n\nThe 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.\n\nUnder the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.\n\nInside, interiors were mildly revised with the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.\n\n'''1963'''\n[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]\nThe 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.\n\nInside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.\n\nThe same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.\n\n{{clear_left}}\n'''1964'''\n\n[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]\nMinor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped \"Custom\" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.<ref>Gunnell, p. 113</ref>\n\nUnder the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.\n\nReplacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.\n\nInside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.\n\n==Third generation (1965\u20131970)==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop.jpg\n | caption = 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop\n | name= Third generation\n | model_years    = 1965\u20131970\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]] sedan\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#340|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] V8\n | transmission= 2-speed [[Super Turbine 300|ST-300]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|ST-400]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] automatic\n | wheelbase= \n |related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n|layout=[[FR layout]]\n}}\n\n'''1965'''\n\nLeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the \"X\" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].\n\nStarting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.\n\n[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nInteriors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963\u201364 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.\n\nDrivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre \"400\" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine \"400\" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.\n\nBuick's engine\u2013transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.\n\n'''1966'''\n[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]\nNew grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.\n\nUnder the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.\n\n'''1967'''\n[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&W St-L\u00e9onard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]\n\nSomewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.\n\nNew options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.\n\nEngine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.\n{{-}}\n'''1968'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.\n\nA new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The \"LeSabre 400\" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The \"Switch-Pitch\" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.\n{{-}}\n'''1969'''\n[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]\nThe 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.\nInteriors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.\n\nAlso new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.\n\nPowertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre \"400\" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.\n\n'''1970'''\n[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pi\u00e8ces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nOnly minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.\n\nBoth base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.\n\nTransmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the \"Super Turbine\" designation used since 1964.\n\nAt the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.\n\nFor the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.\n\nThe 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Fourth generation (1971\u20131976)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1976 Buick LeSabre Custom.JPG\n | name= Fourth generation\n | model_years    = 1971\u20131976\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]]\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n | transmission= 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n | wheelbase= \n | length= \n | width= \n | height=\n |layout=[[FR layout]]\n | related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Centurion]]\n}}\n\n'''1971'''\n\nLike the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.\n\n[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]\nThe same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.\n\nThe new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.\n\nHowever, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.\n\nAlso new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.\n\nInside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a \"455\" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the \"Custom\" badge normally used.\n\n'''1972'''\n[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]\nA revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small \"BUICK\" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling \"B&nbsp;U&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;K\" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.\n\nInterior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.\n\nBoth the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.\n\nInside, the instrument panel featured a new \"FASTEN SEAT BELTS\" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.\n\n'''1973'''\n[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&nbsp;mph bumpers]]\nA larger federally mandated \"5&nbsp;mph\" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.\n\nThe LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.\n\n'''1974'''\n[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]\nNew grilles and taillights along with a 5&nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.\n\nInside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.\n\nNew integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.\n\nWith the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.\n\nEngine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 \"performance package\" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.\n\nNew options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a \"low fuel\" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.\n\n'''1975'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.\n\nEngine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.\n\nBodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window \"Colonnade\" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.\n\nInside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&nbsp;mph compared to 120&nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.\n\nConvertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.\n\n'''1976'''\n\nOnly minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.\n\nThe '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.\n\n==Fifth generation (1977\u20131985)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1977 Buick LeSabre Custom Landau (17485350663).jpg\n | caption= 1977 Buick LeSabre Coupe\n | name= Fifth generation\n | model_years    = 1977\u20131985\n | body_style= 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | platform=[[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | layout=[[FR layout]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick]] V6<br />{{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|Pontiac]] V8<br />{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LF9 Diesel|Oldsmobile]] Diesel V8<br />{{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile]] V8\n | transmission= 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (THM-350 or THM-400) automatic<br />4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|THM200-4R]] automatic\n | related= [[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Safari]]<br/>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Estate]]\n}}\n\n'''1977'''\n[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\n\nThe '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a \"corporate-wide\" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.\n\nAlthough the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.\n\n'''Size comparison between 1974 and 1984 Buick LeSabre sedans'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n!\n!1974 Buick LeSabre\n!1984 Buick LeSabre\n|-\n|Wheelbase || {{Convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Overall Length || {{Convert|226.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|218.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width|| {{Convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|78.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height|| {{Convert|54.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Weight\n|4486&nbsp;lbs (2035&nbsp;kg)\n|3637&nbsp;lbs (1650&nbsp;kg)\n|-\n|Front Headroom|| {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|39.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Legroom|| {{Convert|42.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|42.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Hip Room|| {{Convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|64.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Headroom|| {{Convert|38.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Legroom\u2013ins.|| {{Convert|38.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Hip Room|| {{Convert|61.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|63.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Luggage Capacity|| {{Convert|19.7|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|20.8|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\n'''1978'''\nFollowing a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285&nbsp;lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.\n\n'''1979'''\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\nOnly minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.\n\n'''1980'''\n[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]\nNew sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977\u201379 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.\n\nEngine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.\n\n'''1981'''\n[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]\nOnly minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.<ref>Gunnell, pp. 199-200</ref> Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's \"Computer Command Control\" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.\n\nThe three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.\n\nLeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.\n\n'''1982-83'''\n[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]\n\nFew changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.\n\n'''1984'''\n[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\nNew grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).\n\n'''1985'''\n\nThis would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992\u201396 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.\n{{-}}\n\n==Sixth generation (1986\u20131991)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1986 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n | caption = 1986 LeSabre sedan\n | name= Sixth generation\n | model_years=1986\u20131991\n | layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n | platform=[[GM H platform|H-body]]\n | engine= {{unbulleted list | 3.0&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN7|''LN7'']] [[V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LG2|''LG2/LG3'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN3|''LN3'']] V6 }}\n | wheelbase={{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | length={{convert|196.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|197.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (Limited)\n | width={{convert|72.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | assembly=[[Flint, Michigan]], [[United States]]\n | height={{convert|55.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | body_style=2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n | related= [[Oldsmobile 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n | transmission= 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|4T60]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n}}\n\nThe 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.\n\nMost Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous \"3800\" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substitution of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.\n\nIn 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of \"Premium American Motorcars\" rather than sporty/performance models.\n\nBeginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.\n\n<gallery widths=200px heights=120px>\nFile:'80s LeSabre Coupe.jpg|1987-1989 LeSabre coupe\nFile:Buick LeSabre Limited 1 -- 11-24-2009.jpg|1987\u20131989 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan\nFile:1988 Buick LeSabre T-type, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|1988 Buick LeSabre T-type coupe\nFile:1990-1991 Buick LeSabre -- 09-22-2010.jpg|1990\u20131991 Buick LeSabre sedan\nFile:1990-91 Buick LeSabre Custom, rear right.jpg|Rear view of 1990-1991 LeSabre Custom sedan\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n==Seventh generation (1992\u20131999)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1992-96 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n| name = Seventh generation\n| production = 1991-June 1999\n| model_years = 1992\u20131999\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform = [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|''3800 Series I'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|''3800 Series II'']] V6 }}\n| designer = Bill Porter\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]] automatic<br />4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|200.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|200.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| width = {{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)\n| height = {{convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| assembly = Wentzville, Missouri United States\n| related = [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile 88/Regency/LSS]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n}}\nThis LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door (\"[[family]]-style\") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.\n\n[[File:1992 - 1996 Buick LeSabre Custom (rear).jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of 1994-96 Buick LeSabre]]\n[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]\nThe LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (305 [[N\u00b7m]]) The 3513&nbsp;lb (1593&nbsp;kg) car got 18&nbsp;mpg (13.1&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) in the city and 28&nbsp;mpg (8.4&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&nbsp;mph (129&nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&nbsp;mph (173&nbsp;km/h).\n\nThe LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.\n\nIn 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included \"90th Anniversary\" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.\n\nFor 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&nbsp;MPG city and 30&nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.\n\n[[File:1998 Buick LeSabre Limited, Emerald Green, front right.jpg|left|thumb|Facelift Buick LeSabre Limited (1998)]]\n[[File:LeSabre Dash.JPG|thumb|Late '90s LeSabre dashboard]]\nThe LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was \"1970-something\" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.  The last 1999 LeSabre left Buick City's final line as the last Buick City-built car in June 1999.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Eighth generation (2000\u20132005)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name= Eighth generation\n | image=2000-2005 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n | production     = March 1999-August 2005\n | model_years    = 2000\u20132005\n | assembly=[[Lake Orion, Michigan]], [[United States]]<br />[[Hamtramck, Michigan]], [[United States]]\n | body_style= 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n | platform= [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]<ref name=\"Frame\">{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H CARS MOVE TO G PLATFORM|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}</ref>\n | related=[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Aurora]]<br />[[Buick Riviera]]<br />[[Cadillac Seville]] \n| layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n | engine= 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]]\n | transmission= 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n | wheelbase= {{convert|112.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | length= {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | width= {{convert|73.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | height={{convert|57|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n }}\nThe 2000 LeSabre was introduced in March 1999. It was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.<ref name=\"Frame\"/>  The LeSabre was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.\n\nSome of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions.  Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.\n\nIn 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial. The Celebration Edition featured all the standard equipment of the Limited with a choice pearlescent White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16\" chrome wheels, and special badging. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, [[OnStar]], EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and RainSense automatic windshield wipers.  Although created to commemorate Buick's centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAmong other packages offered on LeSabre included a Platinum Edition package on 2004 Customs.\n\nThe standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]] providing:\n* Power: 205 [[horsepower|hp]] (153 [[kilowatt|kW]])\n* Torque: 230 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (312 [[N\u00b7m]])\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Discontinuation==\nThe LeSabre was America's best-selling full- size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]], Buick's newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the [[Lake Orion, Michigan]] assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the [[Pontiac G6]]) and the last [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] LeSabre rolled off the assembly line in mid-August, 2005.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}<references/>\n* {{cite journal|title=Buick LeSabre|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|author=[[Patrick Bedard]]|issue=March 1992|pages=128\u2013129}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.lesabret.com/ Board Dedicated to 87-89 LeSabre T Types]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120215246/http://www.lesabret-type.com/ Website containing information on the 86 LeSabre Grand National and 87-89 LeSabre T Type]\n* [http://www.zamiska.net/bltregistry/ The Buick Lesabre Grand National and T-type Registry]\n\n{{Buick Vehicles}}\n{{Buick postwar timeline}}\n{{Buick}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buick Lesabre}}\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Buick vehicles|LeSabre]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1959]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2019}}\n{{short description|Full-size car by General Motors}}\n{{Redir|LeSabre}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=00-05 Buick LeSabre 1.jpg\n|caption = 2000 - 2005 Buick LeSabre\n|name=Buick LeSabre\n|manufacturer= [[General Motors]]\n| model_years    = 1959\u20132005\n|predecessor=[[Buick Special]]\n|successor=[[Buick Lucerne]]\n|class=Full-size car\n| layout    = {{ubl |[[FR layout]] (1959\u20131985) |[[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]] (1986\u20132005)}}\n}}\nThe '''Buick LeSabre''' was a [[full-size]] car made by General Motors from 1959 to 2005.  Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936\u201358). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for \"the [[sabre]]\".\n\n==History of model==\nThe LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],<ref>Flory,  J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021.</ref> which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.\n\nIn addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.\n\n[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]\nFrom 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an \"economy\" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a \"no cost\" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost \"economy\" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964\u201365), 340 (1966\u201367) and 350 (1968\u201376). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.\n\nFor most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.\n\nLeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.\n\n==First generation (1959\u20131960)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = File:59 LeSabre 06-15-2019 Queen Street Cruise.jpg\n| caption = 1959 Buick LeSabre four-door hardtop\n| name = First generation\n| model_years = 1959\u20131960\n| related = [[Pontiac Catalina]]<br>[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br>[[Buick Invicta]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br>[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Super 88]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Dynamic 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br>[[Pontiac Parisienne]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Star Chief]]<br>[[Pontiac Strato Chief]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Ventura]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />2-speed automatic\n| engine = {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n\n'''1959'''\n\nLeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959\u201360). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and \"Delta-wing\" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. \n[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]\nWhile Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed \"Triple Turbine\" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.\n\n'''1960'''\n[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]\nThe 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new \"Tri-Shield\" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]\" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were \"four-holers\".\n\nInside, a revised instrument panel featured a \"Mirromatic\" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.\n\n{{-}}\n{{anchor|second}}\n\n==Second generation (1961\u20131964)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name= Second generation\n | model_years    = 1961\u20131964\n | layout= [[FR layout]]\n|image='64 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg\n | engine={{unbulleted list | {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|''Small-Block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#364|''Nailhead'']] V8 | {{convert|401|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#401|''Nailhead'']] V8 }}\n | body_style= 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | transmission= {{unbulleted list | 3/4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] | 2/3-speed automatic }}\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n'''1961'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]\nLeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}} but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.\n\nInside were revised instrument panels retaining the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.<ref name=\"buick\">{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 106\u2013107 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}</ref>\n\nEngines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.<ref name=\"buick\"/>\n\n'''1962'''\n\nThe 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.\n\nUnder the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.\n\nInside, interiors were mildly revised with the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.\n\n'''1963'''\n[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]\nThe 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.\n\nInside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.\n\nThe same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.\n\n{{clear_left}}\n'''1964'''\n\n[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]\nMinor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped \"Custom\" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.<ref>Gunnell, p. 113</ref>\n\nUnder the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.\n\nReplacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.\n\nInside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.\n\n==Third generation (1965\u20131970)==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop.jpg\n | caption = 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop\n | name= Third generation\n | model_years    = 1965\u20131970\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]] sedan\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#340|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] V8\n | transmission= 2-speed [[Super Turbine 300|ST-300]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|ST-400]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] automatic\n | wheelbase= \n |related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n|layout=[[FR layout]]\n}}\n\n'''1965'''\n\nLeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the \"X\" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].\n\nStarting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.\n\n[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nInteriors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963\u201364 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.\n\nDrivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre \"400\" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine \"400\" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.\n\nBuick's engine\u2013transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.\n\n'''1966'''\n[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]\nNew grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.\n\nUnder the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.\n\n'''1967'''\n[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&W St-L\u00e9onard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]\n\nSomewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.\n\nNew options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.\n\nEngine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.\n{{-}}\n'''1968'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.\n\nA new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The \"LeSabre 400\" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The \"Switch-Pitch\" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.\n{{-}}\n'''1969'''\n[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]\nThe 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.\nInteriors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.\n\nAlso new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.\n\nPowertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre \"400\" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.\n\n'''1970'''\n[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pi\u00e8ces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nOnly minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.\n\nBoth base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.\n\nTransmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the \"Super Turbine\" designation used since 1964.\n\nAt the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.\n\nFor the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.\n\nThe 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Fourth generation (1971\u20131976)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1976 Buick LeSabre Custom.JPG\n | name= Fourth generation\n | model_years    = 1971\u20131976\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]]\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n | transmission= 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n | wheelbase= \n | length= \n | width= \n | height=\n |layout=[[FR layout]]\n | related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Centurion]]\n}}\n\n'''1971'''\n\nLike the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.\n\n[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]\nThe same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.\n\nThe new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.\n\nHowever, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.\n\nAlso new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.\n\nInside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a \"455\" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the \"Custom\" badge normally used.\n\n'''1972'''\n[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]\nA revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small \"BUICK\" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling \"B&nbsp;U&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;K\" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.\n\nInterior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.\n\nBoth the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.\n\nInside, the instrument panel featured a new \"FASTEN SEAT BELTS\" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.\n\n'''1973'''\n[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&nbsp;mph bumpers]]\nA larger federally mandated \"5&nbsp;mph\" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.\n\nThe LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.\n\n'''1974'''\n[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]\nNew grilles and taillights along with a 5&nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.\n\nInside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.\n\nNew integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.\n\nWith the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.\n\nEngine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 \"performance package\" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.\n\nNew options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a \"low fuel\" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.\n\n'''1975'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.\n\nEngine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.\n\nBodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window \"Colonnade\" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.\n\nInside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&nbsp;mph compared to 120&nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.\n\nConvertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.\n\n'''1976'''\n\nOnly minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.\n\nThe '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.\n\n==Fifth generation (1977\u20131985)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1977 Buick LeSabre Custom Landau (17485350663).jpg\n | caption= 1977 Buick LeSabre Coupe\n | name= Fifth generation\n | model_years    = 1977\u20131985\n | body_style= 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | platform=[[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | layout=[[FR layout]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick]] V6<br />{{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|Pontiac]] V8<br />{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LF9 Diesel|Oldsmobile]] Diesel V8<br />{{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile]] V8\n | transmission= 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (THM-350 or THM-400) automatic<br />4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|THM200-4R]] automatic\n | related= [[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Safari]]<br/>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Estate]]\n}}\n\n'''1977'''\n[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\n\nThe '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a \"corporate-wide\" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.\n\nAlthough the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.\n\n'''Size comparison between 1974 and 1984 Buick LeSabre sedans'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n!\n!1974 Buick LeSabre\n!1984 Buick LeSabre\n|-\n|Wheelbase || {{Convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Overall Length || {{Convert|226.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|218.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width|| {{Convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|78.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height|| {{Convert|54.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Weight\n|4486&nbsp;lbs (2035&nbsp;kg)\n|3637&nbsp;lbs (1650&nbsp;kg)\n|-\n|Front Headroom|| {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|39.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Legroom|| {{Convert|42.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|42.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Hip Room|| {{Convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|64.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Headroom|| {{Convert|38.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Legroom\u2013ins.|| {{Convert|38.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Hip Room|| {{Convert|61.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|63.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Luggage Capacity|| {{Convert|19.7|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|20.8|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\n'''1978'''\nFollowing a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285&nbsp;lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.\n\n'''1979'''\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\nOnly minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.\n\n'''1980'''\n[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]\nNew sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977\u201379 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.\n\nEngine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.\n\n'''1981'''\n[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]\nOnly minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.<ref>Gunnell, pp. 199-200</ref> Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's \"Computer Command Control\" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.\n\nThe three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.\n\nLeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.\n\n'''1982-83'''\n[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]\n\nFew changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.\n\n'''1984'''\n[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\nNew grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).\n\n'''1985'''\n\nThis would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992\u201396 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.\n{{-}}\n\n==Sixth generation (1986\u20131991)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1986 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n | caption = 1986 LeSabre sedan\n | name= Sixth generation\n | model_years=1986\u20131991\n | layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n | platform=[[GM H platform|H-body]]\n | engine= {{unbulleted list | 3.0&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN7|''LN7'']] [[V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LG2|''LG2/LG3'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN3|''LN3'']] V6 }}\n | wheelbase={{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | length={{convert|196.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|197.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (Limited)\n | width={{convert|72.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | assembly=[[Flint, Michigan]], [[United States]]\n | height={{convert|55.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | body_style=2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n | related= [[Oldsmobile 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n | transmission= 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|4T60]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n}}\n\nThe 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.\n\nMost Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous \"3800\" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substitution of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.\n\nIn 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of \"Premium American Motorcars\" rather than sporty/performance models.\n\nBeginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.\n\n<gallery widths=200px heights=120px>\nFile:'80s LeSabre Coupe.jpg|1987-1989 LeSabre coupe\nFile:Buick LeSabre Limited 1 -- 11-24-2009.jpg|1987\u20131989 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan\nFile:1988 Buick LeSabre T-type, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|1988 Buick LeSabre T-type coupe\nFile:1990-1991 Buick LeSabre -- 09-22-2010.jpg|1990\u20131991 Buick LeSabre sedan\nFile:1990-91 Buick LeSabre Custom, rear right.jpg|Rear view of 1990-1991 LeSabre Custom sedan\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n==Seventh generation (1992\u20131999)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1992-96 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n| name = Seventh generation\n| production = 1991-June 1999\n| model_years = 1992\u20131999\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform = [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|''3800 Series I'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|''3800 Series II'']] V6 }}\n| designer = Bill Porter\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]] automatic<br />4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|200.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|200.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| width = {{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)\n| height = {{convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| assembly = Wentzville, Missouri United States\n| related = [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile 88/Regency/LSS]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n}}\nThis LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door (\"[[family]]-style\") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.\n\n[[File:1992 - 1996 Buick LeSabre Custom (rear).jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of 1994-96 Buick LeSabre]]\n[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]\nThe LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (305 [[N\u00b7m]]) The 3513&nbsp;lb (1593&nbsp;kg) car got 18&nbsp;mpg (13.1&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) in the city and 28&nbsp;mpg (8.4&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&nbsp;mph (129&nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&nbsp;mph (173&nbsp;km/h).\n\nThe LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.\n\nIn 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included \"90th Anniversary\" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.\n\nFor 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&nbsp;MPG city and 30&nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.\n\n[[File:1998 Buick LeSabre Limited, Emerald Green, front right.jpg|left|thumb|Facelift Buick LeSabre Limited (1998)]]\n[[File:LeSabre Dash.JPG|thumb|Late '90s LeSabre dashboard]]\nThe LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was \"1970-something\" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.

It was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.<ref name=\"Frame\"/>  The LeSabre was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.\n\nSome of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions.  Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.\n\nIn 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial. The Celebration Edition featured all the standard equipment of the Limited with a choice pearlescent White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16\" chrome wheels, and special badging. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, [[OnStar]], EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and RainSense automatic windshield wipers.  Although created to commemorate Buick's centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAmong other packages offered on LeSabre included a Platinum Edition package on 2004 Customs.\n\nThe standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]] providing:\n* Power: 205 [[horsepower|hp]] (153 [[kilowatt|kW]])\n* Torque: 230 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (312 [[N\u00b7m]])\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Discontinuation==\nThe LeSabre was America's best-selling full- size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]], Buick's newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the [[Lake Orion, Michigan]] assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the [[Pontiac G6]]) and the last [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] LeSabre rolled off the assembly line in mid-August, 2005.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}<references/>\n* {{cite journal|title=Buick LeSabre|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|author=[[Patrick Bedard]]|issue=March 1992|pages=128\u2013129}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.lesabret.com/ Board Dedicated to 87-89 LeSabre T Types]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120215246/http://www.lesabret-type.com/ Website containing information on the 86 LeSabre Grand National and 87-89 LeSabre T Type]\n* [http://www.zamiska.net/bltregistry/ The Buick Lesabre Grand National and T-type Registry]\n\n{{Buick Vehicles}}\n{{Buick postwar timeline}}\n{{Buick}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buick Lesabre}}\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Buick vehicles|LeSabre]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1959]]\n", "name_user": "2605:e000:1528:436f:4864:f299:b9b0:cbe3", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_LeSabre"}
