From this his scope has broadened to embrace more generally the competitive relationships between religious institutions and the state in modern Europe. He is the author of a study of Christian\u2013Jewish relations in [[Prussia]] (''The Politics of Conversion. Missionary Protestantism and the Jews in Prussia, 1728\u20131941''; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995).\n\n===''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600\u20131947''===\nProfessor Clark's best-selling history of Prussia (''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600\u20131947''; London: [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], 2006) won several prestigious prizes and its critical reception gave him a public profile that reached well beyond the academic world. The German language version of the book, entitled ''Preu\u00dfen. Aufstieg und Niedergang 1600\u20131947'', won for Clark the 2010 {{ill|German Historians' Prize|de|Preis des Historischen Kollegs}}, an award normally given to historians nearing the ends of their careers. Clark remains (in 2014) the youngest ever recipient of this triennial prize, and the only one of the winners not to have approached his work as a mother-tongue German speaker. In 17 chapters covering 800 pages, Clark contends that Germany was \"not the fulfillment of Prussia's destiny but its downfall\".<ref>\"Nicht die Erf\u00fcllung Preu\u00dfens, sondern sein Verderben\". Christopher Clark: ''Preu\u00dfen. Aufstieg und Niedergang. 1600\u20131947.'' 2007, S. 13.</ref> Although the nineteenth century [[Kulturkampf]] was characterised by a peculiar intensity and radicalism, Clark's careful study of sources in several different European languages enabled him to spell out just how closely the Prussian experience of church-state rivalry resembled events elsewhere in Europe. In this way the book powerfully rebuts the traditional [[Sonderweg]] bandwagon, whereby throughout the twentieth century mainstream historians have placed great emphasis on the \"differentness\" of Germany's historical path, before and during the nineteenth century. Clark downplays the perceived uniqueness of the much vaunted reform agenda pursued by Prussia between 1815 and 1848. He believes that the political and economic significance of the [[Zollverein|German customs union]], established in 1834, came to be discovered and then overstated by historians only retrospectively, and in the light of much later political developments.\n\n===''Kaiser Wilhelm II''===\nWith his critical biography of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|last German Kaiser]] (''Kaiser Wilhelm II''; Harlow: [[Longman]], 2000, series \"Profiles in Power\"), Clark aims to offer correctives to many of the traditional positions presented in [[John C. G. R\u00f6hl|J. C. G. R\u00f6hl]]'s three-volume biography of Wilhelm.\n\n===''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''===\nClark's study of the outbreak of the [[First World War]], ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'', appeared in English in 2012;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/interview-mit-christopher-clark-dieser-krieg-hat-das-ganze.724.de.html?dram:article_id=275077|accessdate=26 June 2014|title=''Interview mit Christopher Clark. \"Dieser Krieg hat das ganze Jahrhundert entstellt\"''|type=[[Deutschlandfunk]] interview in German, originally published in 2013, by Thilo K\u00f6\u00dfler with Clark about Clark's book ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''}}</ref> the German version (''Die Schlafwandler: Wie Europa in den Ersten Weltkrieg zog'') followed in 2013.

Risks inherent in the strategies pursued by the various governments involved had been taken before without catastrophic consequences: this now enabled leaders to follow similar approaches while not adequately evaluating or recognising those risks.

The report was in support of the family's claims for compensation under a 1994 German law allowing restitution for the loss of property confiscated by the [[German Democratic Republic]] on condition that the claimants or their ancestors had not \"given substantial support\" to the National Socialist or East German Communist regimes. Clark acknowledged that expressions of support for the Nazis had been made by the last Kaiser's eldest son, [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Wilhelm]], the most senior member of the former dynasty in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s and the owner of the Hohenzollern properties. But his report concluded that Wilhelm was \"one of the politically most reserved and least compromised persons\" among the aristocratic Nazi collaborators, and that he was simply too marginal a figure to have been able to give \"significant support\" to Hitler \u2013 a position that supported the Hohenzollerns' claims.<ref name=Motadel>[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/03/26/what-do-the-hohenzollerns-deserve/ \"What Do the Hohenzollerns Deserve?\"] by David Motadel, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 26 March 2020 {{subscription required}}</ref> \n\nClark's report was criticised by two historians commissioned by the German state to consider the Hohenzollern claims: {{ill|Peter Brandt (historian)|de|Peter Brandt (Historiker)|lt=Peter Brandt}}, a specialist in Prussia and imperial Germany at the [[University of Hagen]], and {{ill|Stephan Malinowski|de}}, a German historian at the [[University of Edinburgh]], who is the author of the standard work on the relationship between the German aristocracy and the Nazi movement, ''Vom K\u00f6nig zum F\u00fchrer'' (2003). Brandt and Malinowski provided substantial further evidence of Wilhelm's support for the Nazis that Clark had overlooked. Their two reports leave no doubt about the prince's deep-seated anti-Semitism.<ref name=Motadel />\n\nAmidst the historical controversy that unfolded in the German press, [[Richard J.

From this his scope has broadened to embrace more generally the competitive relationships between religious institutions and the state in modern Europe. He is the author of a study of Christian\u2013Jewish relations in [[Prussia]] (''The Politics of Conversion. Missionary Protestantism and the Jews in Prussia, 1728\u20131941''; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995).\n\n===''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600\u20131947''===\nProfessor Clark's best-selling history of Prussia (''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600\u20131947''; London: [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], 2006) won several prestigious prizes and its critical reception gave him a public profile that reached well beyond the academic world. The German language version of the book, entitled ''Preu\u00dfen. Aufstieg und Niedergang 1600\u20131947'', won for Clark the 2010 {{ill|German Historians' Prize|de|Preis des Historischen Kollegs}}, an award normally given to historians nearing the ends of their careers. Clark remains (in 2014) the youngest ever recipient of this triennial prize, and the only one of the winners not to have approached his work as a mother-tongue German speaker. In 17 chapters covering 800 pages, Clark contends that Germany was \"not the fulfillment of Prussia's destiny but its downfall\".<ref>\"Nicht die Erf\u00fcllung Preu\u00dfens, sondern sein Verderben\". Christopher Clark: ''Preu\u00dfen. Aufstieg und Niedergang. 1600\u20131947.'' 2007, S. 13.</ref> Although the nineteenth century [[Kulturkampf]] was characterised by a peculiar intensity and radicalism, Clark's careful study of sources in several different European languages enabled him to spell out just how closely the Prussian experience of church-state rivalry resembled events elsewhere in Europe. In this way the book powerfully rebuts the traditional [[Sonderweg]] bandwagon, whereby throughout the twentieth century mainstream historians have placed great emphasis on the \"differentness\" of Germany's historical path, before and during the nineteenth century. Clark downplays the perceived uniqueness of the much vaunted reform agenda pursued by Prussia between 1815 and 1848. He believes that the political and economic significance of the [[Zollverein|German customs union]], established in 1834, came to be discovered and then overstated by historians only retrospectively, and in the light of much later political developments.\n\n===''Kaiser Wilhelm II''===\nWith his critical biography of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|last German Kaiser]] (''Kaiser Wilhelm II''; Harlow: [[Longman]], 2000, series \"Profiles in Power\"), Clark aims to offer correctives to many of the traditional positions presented in [[John C. G. R\u00f6hl|J. C. G. R\u00f6hl]]'s three-volume biography of Wilhelm.\n\n===''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''===\nClark's study of the outbreak of the [[First World War]], ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'', appeared in English in 2012;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/interview-mit-christopher-clark-dieser-krieg-hat-das-ganze.724.de.html?dram:article_id=275077|accessdate=26 June 2014|title=''Interview mit Christopher Clark. \"Dieser Krieg hat das ganze Jahrhundert entstellt\"''|type=[[Deutschlandfunk]] interview in German, originally published in 2013, by Thilo K\u00f6\u00dfler with Clark about Clark's book ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914''}}</ref> the German version (''Die Schlafwandler: Wie Europa in den Ersten Weltkrieg zog'') followed in 2013.

The report was in support of the family's claims for compensation under a 1994 German law allowing restitution for the loss of property confiscated by the [[German Democratic Republic]] on condition that the claimants or their ancestors had not \"given substantial support\" to the National Socialist or East German Communist regimes. Clark acknowledged that expressions of support for the Nazis had been made by the last Kaiser's eldest son, [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Wilhelm]], the most senior member of the former dynasty in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s and the owner of the Hohenzollern properties. But his report concluded that Wilhelm was \"one of the politically most reserved and least compromised persons\" among the aristocratic Nazi collaborators, and that he was simply too marginal a figure to have been able to give \"significant support\" to Hitler \u2013 a position that supported the Hohenzollerns' claims.<ref name=Motadel>[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/03/26/what-do-the-hohenzollerns-deserve/ \"What Do the Hohenzollerns Deserve?\"] by David Motadel, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 26 March 2020 {{subscription required}}</ref> \n\nClark's report was criticised by two historians commissioned by the German state to consider the Hohenzollern claims: {{ill|Peter Brandt (historian)|de|Peter Brandt (Historiker)|lt=Peter Brandt}}, a specialist in Prussia and imperial Germany at the [[University of Hagen]], and {{ill|Stephan Malinowski|de}}, a German historian at the [[University of Edinburgh]], who is the author of the standard work on the relationship between the German aristocracy and the Nazi movement, ''Vom K\u00f6nig zum F\u00fchrer'' (2003). Brandt and Malinowski provided substantial further evidence of Wilhelm's support for the Nazis that Clark had overlooked. Their two reports leave no doubt about the prince's deep-seated anti-Semitism.<ref name=Motadel />\n\nAmidst the historical controversy that unfolded in the German press, [[Richard J.

As the nation developed, Singaporeans began to embrace pay-TV as an additional source of lifestyle entertainment, in addition to other entertainment sources such as cinemas, Internet and DVD/VCD purchase/rentals.\n\nIn 2002, StarHub completed its merger with '''Singapore Cable Vision''' and has adopted its name until in 2007,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sites.starhub.com/portal/site/StarHub/menuitem.876159666306d8a8aa494b608324a5a0/?vgnextoid=99301840a0e3c010VgnVCM10000038425a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=ItemCMId:e70fb567ea02d010VgnVCM100000404114acRCRD#top |title=StarHub and SCV Seal Merger Agreement |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725104630/http://sites.starhub.com/portal/site/StarHub/menuitem.876159666306d8a8aa494b608324a5a0/?vgnextoid=99301840a0e3c010VgnVCM10000038425a0aRCRD#top |archive-date=2009-07-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Milestones|url=http://sites.starhub.com/portal/site/StarHub/menuitem.7d3336855be9ef98aa494b608324a5a0/?vgnextoid=87001840a0e3c010VgnVCM10000038425a0aRCRD|access-date=2009-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815130045/http://sites.starhub.com/portal/site/StarHub/menuitem.7d3336855be9ef98aa494b608324a5a0/?vgnextoid=87001840a0e3c010VgnVCM10000038425a0aRCRD|archive-date=2009-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> where StarHub Cable Television was renamed to '''StarHub TV''', its current name.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sites.starhub.com/portal/site/StarHub/menuitem.876159666306d8a8aa494b608324a5a0/?vgnextoid=99301840a0e3c010VgnVCM10000038425a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=ItemCMId:2ca919785af6c110VgnVCM100000464114acRCRD#top |title=StarHub Realigns and Rebrands TV and Video Content with the Launch of 'STARHUB TV' |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725104630/http://sites.starhub.com/portal/site/StarHub/menuitem.876159666306d8a8aa494b608324a5a0/?vgnextoid=99301840a0e3c010VgnVCM10000038425a0aRCRD#top |archive-date=2009-07-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn 17 February 2009, StarHub announced that their television will be converted to digital and analogue set-top boxes will be terminated by 30 June 2009, beginning a phase of [[digital television transition]] in Singapore.<ref>{{cite web|title=StarHub TV to go into full digital mode|url=http://www.starhub.com/about-us/newsroom/2009/february/17022009_starhubtvtogointofulldigitalmode.html|website=StarHub |date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 April 2010, channel numbers for StarHub TV was overhauled into a three-digit numbering system, allowing easier recall for subscribers.

Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]]. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bangal, Utkala and gave birth to a new [[Brajabuli]] language.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi's preface to Beligatti's ''Alphabetum Brammhanicum'', published in 1771.<ref name=\"Tourutiana\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Djfl_uZqLAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tourutiana&f=false |last=Ded.

It blocked its membership for people outside from the Maithil Brahmin and Karna Kayastha castes. Maithil Mahasabha campaigned for the official recognition of Maithili as a regional language.

Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]]. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bangal, Utkala and gave birth to a new [[Brajabuli]] language.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi's preface to Beligatti's ''Alphabetum Brammhanicum'', published in 1771.<ref name=\"Tourutiana\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Djfl_uZqLAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tourutiana&f=false |last=Ded.

It blocked its membership for people outside from the Maithil Brahmin and Karna Kayastha castes. Maithil Mahasabha campaigned for the official recognition of Maithili as a regional language.
