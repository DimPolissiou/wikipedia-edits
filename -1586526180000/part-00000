Its official designation is '''Army Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter''' (\u4e8c\u5f0f\u5358\u5ea7\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f) and its [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was '''Tojo'''. \n\nThe design and development of the Ki-44 differed greatly to other Japanese fighters of the time, incorporating speed and [[Climb (aeronautics)|rate-of-climb]] in preference to maneuvrability.<ref name=\"millman\">{{cite book |last=Millman |first=Nicholas |author-link= |date=2011 |title=Ki-44 'Tojo' Aces of World War 2 |url= |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=1-8 |isbn=9781849084406}}</ref> This was a result of a need for a [[heavy fighter]] aircraft that followed a more offensive doctrine and the Ki-44 is often classified as an Air Defence Fighter.<ref name=\"millman\"/><ref name=\"Buechel\">{{cite book |last=Buechel |first=Richard M. |author-link= |date=1971 |title=Ki-44 Ia,b,c/IIa,b,c in Japanese Army Air force Service|url= |location=Berkshire, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Its development ran almost in parallel to its predecessor, the lighter and nimble [[Nakajima Ki-43]], and yet the two aircraft differed. The Ki-44 had a higher landing speed and was less maneuverable. These were concerns for pilots who would compare it to the Ki-43 or [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]] which were far more agile and responsive. As a result, the Ki-44 was first restricted to pilots with at least 1000 hours of flying time due to its tricky handling characteristics. However, it was later found that younger pilots who had not been instilled with the extensive aerobatic training of earlier cadres could manage the aircraft perfectly well, so the restriction was removed.<ref name=\"millman\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Ki-44 was the fastest climbing Japanese fighter at the time. While there was performance restrictions at high altitude, it was a useful [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] interceptor and is commonly associated with Home Island defence operations.<ref name=\"millman\"/> It was superior to the Ki-43 in that it was capable of matching Allied aircraft in climbs and dives, giving pilots more flexibility in combat and greater pilot confidence than the Ki-43; the basic armament of four 12.7mm machine guns or two 12.7mm guns and two 20&nbsp;mm cannons (or, in a few aircraft, two [[Ho-301_cannon|Ho-301 40mm cannons]] of limited range) was far more powerful to the older Ki-43's two 12.7mm machine guns.<ref name=\"Ethell1995p101\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=101.}}</ref><ref name=\"Ethell1995p100\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=100.}}</ref> \n\nProduction of the Ki-44 would terminate in late 1944 in favour of the more advanced [[Nakajima Ki-84]], and when the war ended, only three [[Sentai]] units were still equipped with them.<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 221\">Francillon, 1979, p.221</ref> Despite more than 1,200 aircraft built, none have survived the war.\n\n== Design and development ==\n[[File:Ki-44 skeleton.jpg|thumb|A Ki-44 at the Tokorozawa Army Maintenance School.]]\nNakajima began development of the Ki-44 in 1940 as a pure [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] with emphasis being placed on airspeed and rate of climb rather than maneuverability. The Japanese Army Air Force specification called for a maximum speed of 600&nbsp;km/h (370&nbsp;mph) at 4,000&nbsp;m (13,130&nbsp;ft), to be attained in five minutes. A set of Ki-43-like \"butterfly\" combat [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] was fitted for improved maneuverability. Armament consisted of a pair of 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) and a pair of 12.7&nbsp;mm (.50&nbsp;in) [[machine gun]]s.\n\nThe engine selected for the new interceptor was Nakajima's Ha-41 (a development of the [[Nakajima Ha-5]]) 14-cylinder double-row [[Radial engine|radial]], originally intended for bomber aircraft. Although the Ha-41 was not the ideal choice due to its large-diameter cross section, the design team was able to marry this engine to a much smaller fuselage with a narrow cross section. At 1,260&nbsp;mm in diameter, the Ha-41 was 126&nbsp;mm larger in diameter than the 1,144&nbsp;mm [[Nakajima Sakae]] (used in the [[Mitsubishi A6M]] \"Zero\" and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Hayabusa\"). However, the Sakae was only 27.8L in displacement and 1,000&nbsp;hp, while the Ha-41 was 37.5L and made 1,260&nbsp;hp (1,440 in the later Ha-109 version). In any case, since the Sakae wasn't powerful enough, the only alternative available was the Mitsubishi Kinsei, which was slightly smaller than the Ha-41 in diameter, five liters smaller in displacement, and was less powerful. Unfortunately, this was already in demand for many other aircraft, so the Ha-41 was chosen as the best powerplant. In order to achieve its design goals, the wing area was relatively small leading to a high [[wing loading]] and a comparatively high landing speed that could be daunting to the average Japanese pilot, who was more used to aircraft with a low wing loading like the Ki-44's predecessors, the Ki-43 and [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]].\n\nThe first Ki-44 [[prototype]] flew in August 1940 and the initial test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high landing speed and poor forward visibility during taxiing due to the large radial engine.\n\nA second pre-production batch of 40 aircraft were ordered, which featured four 12.7mm machine guns, a relocated air cooler and main gear doors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spick|first=Mike|title=Illustrated Directory of Fighters|year=2002|publisher=MBI Publishing|location=St Paul, USA|isbn=0-7603-1343-1|pages=481}}</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe Nakajima Ki-44 at one point equipped 12 ''[[sentai]]'' (\"[[group (air force)|groups]]/[[wing (air force)|wings]]\") of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force: ''9, 22, 23, 29, 47, 59, 64, 70, 85, 87, 104'' and ''246'' ''Sentai''. The [[Manchukuo Air Force]] also operated some Ki-44s.\n[[File:Wagner Book (15716772013).jpg|thumb|219x219px|Captured Ki-44]]\nPre-production Ki-44 aircraft and two of the prototypes were turned over to the Army for service trials on 15 September 1941. The type commenced operations when nine aircraft were received by an experimental unit, ''47th Chutai'' \"''Kawasemi Buntai''\" (\"Kingfisher [[flight (military unit)|Flight]], 47th Squadron\"), commanded by Major Toshio Sakagawa at [[Saigon]], Indochina in December 1941.\n\nThe Ki-44 also saw significant action with ''87th Sentai'' in the air defense role, while based at [[Palembang]], [[Sumatra]]. Other units equipped with the Ki-44 during the early part of the war were stationed in [[China]], [[Burma]], [[The Philippines]] and [[Korea]].\n\n[[File:Ki-44 (1).jpg|thumb|A Japanese Ki-44.]]\n\nLater in the war, the type saw action in an air defense role over the home islands \u2013 mainly around Japan's large industrial cities. ''47 Chutai'', after it was transferred to air defense roles in Japan, was expanded to become ''47 Sentai''.\n\nThe Ki-44-II ''Otsu'' (also known as the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a [[Ho-301]] 40&nbsp;mm autocannon. While this was a relatively high-caliber weapon, it used [[caseless ammunition]] with a low [[muzzle velocity]] and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special ''Shinten Seiku Tai'' ([[air superiority]] unit), comprising at least four aircraft,<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\">{{Harvnb|Bueschel|1971|overview Air Combat regiments.}}</ref> that was part of ''47th Sentai'', based at [[Narimasu]] airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to [[Aerial ramming|ram]] them \u2013 effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nBy the end of the war, Ki-44 variants were being replaced by the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] ''Hayate'', which was regarded as vastly superior \u2013 in aspects other than maintenance and reliability. \n\nDuring 1946\u201349, both sides in the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] operated Ki-44s surrendered or abandoned by Japanese units. Air units of the [[People's Liberation Army]] obtained aircraft formerly belonging to ''22'' and ''85 Sentai'', which had disbanded in [[Korea|Chosen]]. Some of these aircraft were reportedly flown by Japanese veterans. Within the [[Republic of China Air Force]] 18th Squadron (12th Fighter Group) was equipped with Ki-44s formerly of ''9th Sentai'', which had disbanded in Nanking, and ''29th Sentai'', which had disbanded at [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and they saw action in .<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\" /> Following the retreat of the Nationalists the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (formed in 1949) used the Ki-44 until the early 1950s.\n\n=== Survivors ===\nNo complete surviving examples of the Ki-44 exist. However a wing center section is preserved at the [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] Aviation Museum, at [[Xi'an]] in China.\n\n== Variants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"\n|- style=\"background: #eee;\"\n| colspan=\"4\"| '''Ki-44 Production: [[\u014cta, Gunma|Ota]] Aircraft Plant'''<ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix M. p.40-42</ref><ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix N. p.78</ref>\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Month''' || '''Aircraft<br> Produced''' || '''Government<br> Order'''\n|-\n| 1940 || August || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || September || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || October || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1941 || June || 1 || \n|-\n| 1941 || July || 4 || \n|-\n| 1941 || August || 1 || \n|-\n|'''1940/1'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''9'''||'''9'''\n|-\n| 1942 || January || 1 || \n|-\n| 1942 || February || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || March || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || April || 5 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || May || 7 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || June || 5 || \n|-\n| 1942 || July || 3 || \n|-\n| 1942 || August || 13 || \n|-\n| 1942 || September || 12 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || October || 13 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || November || 34 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || December || 30 || \n|-\n|'''1942'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''131'''||'''168'''\n|-\n| 1943 || January || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || February || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || March || 42 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || April || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || May || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || June || 40 || \n|-\n| 1943 || July || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || August || 51 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || September || 51 || \n|-\n| 1943 || October || 47 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || November || 56 || \n|-\n| 1943 || December || 65 || \n|-\n|'''1943'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''519'''||'''506'''\n|-\n| 1944 || January || 73 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || February || 54 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || March || 75 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || April || 85 || \n|-\n| 1944 || May || 72 || \n|-\n| 1944 || June || 65 || \n|-\n| 1944 || July || 39 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || August || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || September || 29 || \n|-\n| 1944 || October || 22 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || November || 11 || \n|-\n| 1944 || December || 7 || \n|-\n| 1945 || January || 2 || \n|-\n|'''1944/5'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''567'''||'''543'''\n|-\n| '''Total''' || ||'''1223''' || '''1223'''\n|}\n;Ki-44: First prototype (s/n 4401) with Ha-41 engine with a complex cooling system, unique for the first prototype.\n;Ki-44: Nine pre-production aircraft (s/n 4402-4410), the first of which being quite different than the later ones.

Its official designation is '''Army Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter''' (\u4e8c\u5f0f\u5358\u5ea7\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f) and its [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was '''Tojo'''. \n\nThe design and development of the Ki-44 differed greatly to other Japanese fighters of the time, incorporating speed and [[Climb (aeronautics)|rate-of-climb]] in preference to maneuvrability.<ref name=\"millman\">{{cite book |last=Millman |first=Nicholas |author-link= |date=2011 |title=Ki-44 'Tojo' Aces of World War 2 |url= |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=1-8 |isbn=9781849084406}}</ref> This was a result of a need for a [[heavy fighter]] aircraft that followed a more offensive doctrine and the Ki-44 is often classified as an Air Defence Fighter.<ref name=\"millman\"/><ref name=\"Buechel\">{{cite book |last=Buechel |first=Richard M. |author-link= |date=1971 |title=Ki-44 Ia,b,c/IIa,b,c in Japanese Army Air force Service|url= |location=Berkshire, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Its development ran almost in parallel to its predecessor, the lighter and nimble [[Nakajima Ki-43]], and yet the two aircraft differed. The Ki-44 had a higher landing speed and was less maneuverable. These were concerns for pilots who would compare it to the Ki-43 or [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]] which were far more agile and responsive. As a result, the Ki-44 was first restricted to pilots with at least 1000 hours of flying time due to its tricky handling characteristics. However, it was later found that younger pilots who had not been instilled with the extensive aerobatic training of earlier cadres could manage the aircraft perfectly well, so the restriction was removed.<ref name=\"millman\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Ki-44 was the fastest climbing Japanese fighter at the time. While there was performance restrictions at high altitude, it was a useful [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] interceptor and is commonly associated with Home Island defence operations.<ref name=\"millman\"/> It was superior to the Ki-43 in that it was capable of matching Allied aircraft in climbs and dives, giving pilots more flexibility in combat and greater pilot confidence than the Ki-43; the basic armament of four 12.7mm machine guns or two 12.7mm guns and two 20&nbsp;mm cannons (or, in a few aircraft, two [[Ho-301_cannon|Ho-301 40mm cannons]] of limited range) was far more powerful to the older Ki-43's two 12.7mm machine guns.<ref name=\"Ethell1995p101\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=101.}}</ref><ref name=\"Ethell1995p100\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=100.}}</ref> \n\nProduction of the Ki-44 would terminate in late 1944 in favour of the more advanced [[Nakajima Ki-84]], and when the war ended, only three [[Sentai]] units were still equipped with them.<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 221\"/> Despite more than 1,200 aircraft built, none have survived the war.\n\n== Design and development ==\n[[File:Ki-44 skeleton.jpg|thumb|A Ki-44 at the Tokorozawa Army Maintenance School.]]\nNakajima began development of the Ki-44 in 1940 as a pure [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] with emphasis being placed on airspeed and rate of climb rather than maneuverability. The Japanese Army Air Force specification called for a maximum speed of 600&nbsp;km/h (370&nbsp;mph) at 4,000&nbsp;m (13,130&nbsp;ft), to be attained in five minutes. A set of Ki-43-like \"butterfly\" combat [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] was fitted for improved maneuverability. Armament consisted of a pair of 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) and a pair of 12.7&nbsp;mm (.50&nbsp;in) [[machine gun]]s.\n\nThe engine selected for the new interceptor was Nakajima's Ha-41 (a development of the [[Nakajima Ha-5]]) 14-cylinder double-row [[Radial engine|radial]], originally intended for bomber aircraft. Although the Ha-41 was not the ideal choice due to its large-diameter cross section, the design team was able to marry this engine to a much smaller fuselage with a narrow cross section. At 1,260&nbsp;mm in diameter, the Ha-41 was 126&nbsp;mm larger in diameter than the 1,144&nbsp;mm [[Nakajima Sakae]] (used in the [[Mitsubishi A6M]] \"Zero\" and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Hayabusa\"). However, the Sakae was only 27.8L in displacement and 1,000&nbsp;hp, while the Ha-41 was 37.5L and made 1,260&nbsp;hp (1,440 in the later Ha-109 version). In any case, since the Sakae wasn't powerful enough, the only alternative available was the Mitsubishi Kinsei, which was slightly smaller than the Ha-41 in diameter, five liters smaller in displacement, and was less powerful. Unfortunately, this was already in demand for many other aircraft, so the Ha-41 was chosen as the best powerplant. In order to achieve its design goals, the wing area was relatively small leading to a high [[wing loading]] and a comparatively high landing speed that could be daunting to the average Japanese pilot, who was more used to aircraft with a low wing loading like the Ki-44's predecessors, the Ki-43 and [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]].\n\nThe first Ki-44 [[prototype]] flew in August 1940 and the initial test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high landing speed and poor forward visibility during taxiing due to the large radial engine.\n\nA second pre-production batch of 40 aircraft were ordered, which featured four 12.7mm machine guns, a relocated air cooler and main gear doors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spick|first=Mike|title=Illustrated Directory of Fighters|year=2002|publisher=MBI Publishing|location=St Paul, USA|isbn=0-7603-1343-1|pages=481}}</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe Nakajima Ki-44 at one point equipped 12 ''[[sentai]]'' (\"[[group (air force)|groups]]/[[wing (air force)|wings]]\") of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force: ''9, 22, 23, 29, 47, 59, 64, 70, 85, 87, 104'' and ''246'' ''Sentai''. The [[Manchukuo Air Force]] also operated some Ki-44s.\n[[File:Wagner Book (15716772013).jpg|thumb|219x219px|Captured Ki-44]]\nPre-production Ki-44 aircraft and two of the prototypes were turned over to the Army for service trials on 15 September 1941. The type commenced operations when nine aircraft were received by an experimental unit, ''47th Chutai'' \"''Kawasemi Buntai''\" (\"Kingfisher [[flight (military unit)|Flight]], 47th Squadron\"), commanded by Major Toshio Sakagawa at [[Saigon]], Indochina in December 1941.\n\nThe Ki-44 also saw significant action with ''87th Sentai'' in the air defense role, while based at [[Palembang]], [[Sumatra]]. Other units equipped with the Ki-44 during the early part of the war were stationed in [[China]], [[Burma]], [[The Philippines]] and [[Korea]].\n\n[[File:Ki-44 (1).jpg|thumb|A Japanese Ki-44.]]\n\nLater in the war, the type saw action in an air defense role over the home islands \u2013 mainly around Japan's large industrial cities. ''47 Chutai'', after it was transferred to air defense roles in Japan, was expanded to become ''47 Sentai''.\n\nThe Ki-44-II ''Otsu'' (also known as the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a [[Ho-301]] 40&nbsp;mm autocannon. While this was a relatively high-caliber weapon, it used [[caseless ammunition]] with a low [[muzzle velocity]] and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special ''Shinten Seiku Tai'' ([[air superiority]] unit), comprising at least four aircraft,<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\">{{Harvnb|Bueschel|1971|overview Air Combat regiments.}}</ref> that was part of ''47th Sentai'', based at [[Narimasu]] airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to [[Aerial ramming|ram]] them \u2013 effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nBy the end of the war, Ki-44 variants were being replaced by the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] ''Hayate'', which was regarded as vastly superior \u2013 in aspects other than maintenance and reliability. \n\nDuring 1946\u201349, both sides in the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] operated Ki-44s surrendered or abandoned by Japanese units. Air units of the [[People's Liberation Army]] obtained aircraft formerly belonging to ''22'' and ''85 Sentai'', which had disbanded in [[Korea|Chosen]]. Some of these aircraft were reportedly flown by Japanese veterans. Within the [[Republic of China Air Force]] 18th Squadron (12th Fighter Group) was equipped with Ki-44s formerly of ''9th Sentai'', which had disbanded in Nanking, and ''29th Sentai'', which had disbanded at [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and they saw action in .<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\" /> Following the retreat of the Nationalists the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (formed in 1949) used the Ki-44 until the early 1950s.\n\n=== Survivors ===\nNo complete surviving examples of the Ki-44 exist. However a wing center section is preserved at the [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] Aviation Museum, at [[Xi'an]] in China.\n\n== Variants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"\n|- style=\"background: #eee;\"\n| colspan=\"4\"| '''Ki-44 Production: [[\u014cta, Gunma|Ota]] Aircraft Plant'''<ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix M. p.40-42</ref><ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix N. p.78</ref>\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Month''' || '''Aircraft<br> Produced''' || '''Government<br> Order'''\n|-\n| 1940 || August || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || September || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || October || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1941 || June || 1 || \n|-\n| 1941 || July || 4 || \n|-\n| 1941 || August || 1 || \n|-\n|'''1940/1'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''9'''||'''9'''\n|-\n| 1942 || January || 1 || \n|-\n| 1942 || February || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || March || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || April || 5 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || May || 7 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || June || 5 || \n|-\n| 1942 || July || 3 || \n|-\n| 1942 || August || 13 || \n|-\n| 1942 || September || 12 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || October || 13 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || November || 34 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || December || 30 || \n|-\n|'''1942'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''131'''||'''168'''\n|-\n| 1943 || January || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || February || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || March || 42 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || April || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || May || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || June || 40 || \n|-\n| 1943 || July || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || August || 51 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || September || 51 || \n|-\n| 1943 || October || 47 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || November || 56 || \n|-\n| 1943 || December || 65 || \n|-\n|'''1943'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''519'''||'''506'''\n|-\n| 1944 || January || 73 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || February || 54 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || March || 75 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || April || 85 || \n|-\n| 1944 || May || 72 || \n|-\n| 1944 || June || 65 || \n|-\n| 1944 || July || 39 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || August || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || September || 29 || \n|-\n| 1944 || October || 22 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || November || 11 || \n|-\n| 1944 || December || 7 || \n|-\n| 1945 || January || 2 || \n|-\n|'''1944/5'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''567'''||'''543'''\n|-\n| '''Total''' || ||'''1223''' || '''1223'''\n|}\n;Ki-44: First prototype (s/n 4401) with Ha-41 engine with a complex cooling system, unique for the first prototype.\n;Ki-44: Nine pre-production aircraft (s/n 4402-4410), the first of which being quite different than the later ones.

R. R. Tolkien]], '''Moria''', also named '''Khazad-d\u00fbm''', is an ancient subterranean complex in [[Middle-earth]], comprising a vast [[labyrinth]]ine network of tunnels, chambers, mines and halls under the [[Misty Mountains]], with doors on both the western and the eastern sides of the mountain range. Moria is introduced in Tolkien's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and is a major scene of action in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn much of [[History of Arda|Middle-earth's fictional history]], Moria was the greatest city of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|the Dwarves]]. The city's wealth was founded on its mines, which produced ''[[mithril]]'', a fictional metal of great beauty and strength, suitable for armour. The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for ''mithril'', and disturbed a demon of great power: [[Durin's Bane|a Balrog]], which destroyed their kingdom. By the end of the [[Third Age]], Moria had long been abandoned by the Dwarves, and was a place of evil repute. It was dark, in dangerous disrepair, and in its labyrinths lurked [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and the [[Balrog]].\n\nScholars have identified likely sources for Tolkien's Moria: he had studied a Latin inscription about [[Ring of Silvianus|a lost ring]] at the temple of [[Nodens]] in Gloucestershire, at a place called Dwarf's Hill full of old mine-workings. The name Moria, Tolkien wrote, echoed the name of a castle in [[Norwegian Folktales|a Scandinavian folktale]], while Gandalf's death and reappearance reminded critics of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[transfiguration of Jesus]]. The West Gate that crashes closed behind the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] recalled to commentators the [[Wandering Rocks]] of [[Greek mythology]], and [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]]. Finally, the Fellowship's entry into the darkness via the deadly lake by the West Gate, and its exit into the light via the beautiful Mirrormere, alongside Gandalf's death and reappearance, has been compared to a [[baptism]], a ceremony that combines a symbolic death and the gift of new life.\n\nMoria provided dramatic scenes in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', inspired by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]]'s illustrations. Its multiple levels of tunnels and halls have served, too, as the basis for a variety of computer and board games.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien uses [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]] for the names for Moria in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. ''Moria'' is by far the most common name of the place in his writings. The name means \"the Black Chasm\" or \"the Black Pit\", from [[Sindarin]] ''mor'', \"dark, black\" and ''i\u00e2'', \"void, abyss\".<ref name=\"Letter 297\" group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', George Allen & Unwin, letter no. 297 (August 1967) pp. 382-384; {{ISBN|0-04-826005-3}}</ref> The element ''mor'' had the sense \"sinister, evil\", especially by association with infamous names such as ''[[Morgoth]]'' and ''[[Mordor]]''; indeed Moria itself had an evil reputation by the times in which ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set. The name ''Moria'' had (within the fiction) originally applied only to the Black Chasm itself. However, after the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were forced to abandon Khazad-d\u00fbm, its many lamps went out, and the whole subterranean complex became dark. Tolkien [[#Bible|borrowed the name ''Moria'']] itself, but not its meaning, from a book he had read.<ref name=\"Letter 297\" group=T/><ref>[[Wayne G.

In the fictional history, ''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' was Moria's original name, given by the Dwarves in [[Khuzdul|their own language, ''Khuzdul'']]. It is translated as the Dwarrowdelf, ''dwarrow'' being an archaic English form of \"dwarf\", and ''delf'' an archaic alternative to \"delving\", from the verb \"delve\", to dig.  Tolkien rhymes ''d\u00fbm'' with \"tomb\".<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 4 \"A Journey in the Dark\"}}</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's account==\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Misty Mountain (59053312).jpeg|thumb|Mist on the [[Alps]]: Tolkien's experiences on his 1911 visit gave him the idea for difficulties crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name=\"Letters #306\" group=T/>]]\n\nMoria was originally a system of natural caves located in Dimrill Dale, a valley on the eastern side of the Misty Mountains.

Three of the Misty Mountains' most massive peaks surrounded Dimrill Dale: the Mountains of Moria: ''Silvertine'' on the west; ''Redhorn'' on the north; and ''Cloudyhead'' on the east; or in [[Sindarin]] respectively ''Celebdil'', ''Caradhras'' and ''Fanuidhol''. Their [[Khuzd\u00fbl]] names, respectively ''Zirakzigil'', ''Barazinbar'' and ''Bundushath\u00fbr'', are mentioned by Gimli as the Fellowship nears Moria. The caves of Moria, where the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] city-kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm was founded, were situated under Silvertine; their mouth overlooked Dimrill Dale, which contained many waterfalls and a long, oval lake that reflected stars even in daylight. Perceiving [[Durin's Crown|these stars]] as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign, named the lake ''Kheled-z\u00e2ram'', the Mirrormere, and chose the eastward-facing caves above it for his new stronghold.<ref name=\"Lothl\u00f3rien\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 6 \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"}}</ref>\n\n====Geology====\n\nThe [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] excavated most of Khazad-d\u00fbm out of solid rock, leaving polished walls.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Minerals included [[gold]], [[gem]]s and [[iron ore]]. However the principal mineral was ''[[mithril]]'', a fabulously precious and versatile metal found nowhere else in Middle-earth. It was the source of Khazad-d\u00fbm's huge wealth, but ultimately [[#The Mines|its mining]] was the cause of its downfall. Beginning under the Silvertine, the Dwarves mined ever deeper, and down towards the roots of Mount Caradhras. There they unearthed the Balrog, which drove the Dwarves into exile.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nFar below even the deepest mines of the Dwarves lay a primordial underworld of tunnels, [[Subterranean river|streams]] and [[Underground lake|lakes]] in perpetual darkness, inhabited by primitive creatures. The tunnels were \"gnawed by nameless things\" from the beginnings of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]],<ref name=\"The White Rider\" group=T/> along with the [[Watcher in the Water]], which [[Gandalf]] suggested may have come from the underworld's waters.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\n===History===\nMoria was founded by [[Durin]] at the end of the [[Cosmology of Tolkien's legendarium#Stars|Ages of the Stars]]. During his reign, the precious metal mithril was discovered in the mines, and some of the major structures of Moria were built: Durin's Bridge, the Second Hall, the Endless Stair and Durin's Tower.

They were attacked by the monstrous [[Watcher in the Water]] as they entered the West-gate, and faced further perils in the subterranean passages. They reached the Chamber of Mazarbul, the ancient repository of documents holding [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]'s tomb and his colony's chronicle, the Book of Mazarbul.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> They were attacked there by a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]] and many Orcs, before being approached by the Balrog.

R. R. Tolkien]], '''Moria''', also named '''Khazad-d\u00fbm''', is an ancient subterranean complex in [[Middle-earth]], comprising a vast [[labyrinth]]ine network of tunnels, chambers, mines and halls under the [[Misty Mountains]], with doors on both the western and the eastern sides of the mountain range. Moria is introduced in Tolkien's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and is a major scene of action in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn much of [[History of Arda|Middle-earth's fictional history]], Moria was the greatest city of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|the Dwarves]]. The city's wealth was founded on its mines, which produced ''[[mithril]]'', a fictional metal of great beauty and strength, suitable for armour. The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for ''mithril'', and disturbed a demon of great power: [[Durin's Bane|a Balrog]], which destroyed their kingdom. By the end of the [[Third Age]], Moria had long been abandoned by the Dwarves, and was a place of evil repute. It was dark, in dangerous disrepair, and in its labyrinths lurked [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and the [[Balrog]].\n\nScholars have identified likely sources for Tolkien's Moria: he had studied a Latin inscription about [[Ring of Silvianus|a lost ring]] at the temple of [[Nodens]] in Gloucestershire, at a place called Dwarf's Hill full of old mine-workings. The name Moria, Tolkien wrote, echoed the name of a castle in [[Norwegian Folktales|a Scandinavian folktale]], while Gandalf's death and reappearance reminded critics of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[transfiguration of Jesus]]. The West Gate that crashes closed behind the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] recalled to commentators the [[Wandering Rocks]] of [[Greek mythology]], and [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]]. Finally, the Fellowship's entry into the darkness via the deadly lake by the West Gate, and its exit into the light via the beautiful Mirrormere, alongside Gandalf's death and reappearance, has been compared to a [[baptism]], a ceremony that combines a symbolic death and the gift of new life.\n\nMoria provided dramatic scenes in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', inspired by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]]'s illustrations. Its multiple levels of tunnels and halls have served, too, as the basis for a variety of computer and board games.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien uses [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]] for the names for Moria in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. ''Moria'' is by far the most common name of the place in his writings. The name means \"the Black Chasm\" or \"the Black Pit\", from [[Sindarin]] ''mor'', \"dark, black\" and ''i\u00e2'', \"void, abyss\".<ref name=\"Letter 297\" group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', George Allen & Unwin, letter no. 297 (August 1967) pp. 382-384; {{ISBN|0-04-826005-3}}</ref> The element ''mor'' had the sense \"sinister, evil\", especially by association with infamous names such as ''[[Morgoth]]'' and ''[[Mordor]]''; indeed Moria itself had an evil reputation by the times in which ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set. The name ''Moria'' had (within the fiction) originally applied only to the Black Chasm itself. However, after the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were forced to abandon Khazad-d\u00fbm, its many lamps went out, and the whole subterranean complex became dark. Tolkien [[#Bible|borrowed the name ''Moria'']] itself, but not its meaning, from a book he had read.<ref name=\"Letter 297\" group=T/><ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] & [[Christina Scull]] (2005), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', Harper Collins, p. 224 \"Moria\" {{ISBN|0 00 720308 X}}</ref>\n\n''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' is the second-commonest name, used for the fabulous city-kingdom of the Dwarves, especially in an historical or nostalgic context. In the fictional history, ''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' was Moria's original name, given by the Dwarves in [[Khuzdul|their own language, ''Khuzdul'']]. It is translated as the Dwarrowdelf, ''dwarrow'' being an archaic English form of \"dwarf\", and ''delf'' an archaic alternative to \"delving\", from the verb \"delve\", to dig.  Tolkien rhymes ''d\u00fbm'' with \"tomb\".<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 4 \"A Journey in the Dark\"}}</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's account==\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Misty Mountain (59053312).jpeg|thumb|Mist on the [[Alps]]: Tolkien's experiences on his 1911 visit gave him the idea for difficulties crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name=\"Letters #306\" group=T/>]]\n\nMoria was originally a system of natural caves located in Dimrill Dale, a valley on the eastern side of the Misty Mountains.

Three of the Misty Mountains' most massive peaks surrounded Dimrill Dale: the Mountains of Moria: ''Silvertine'' on the west; ''Redhorn'' on the north; and ''Cloudyhead'' on the east; or in [[Sindarin]] respectively ''Celebdil'', ''Caradhras'' and ''Fanuidhol''. Their [[Khuzd\u00fbl]] names, respectively ''Zirakzigil'', ''Barazinbar'' and ''Bundushath\u00fbr'', are mentioned by Gimli as the Fellowship nears Moria. The caves of Moria, where the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] city-kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm was founded, were situated under Silvertine; their mouth overlooked Dimrill Dale, which contained many waterfalls and a long, oval lake that reflected stars even in daylight. Perceiving [[Durin's Crown|these stars]] as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign, named the lake ''Kheled-z\u00e2ram'', the Mirrormere, and chose the eastward-facing caves above it for his new stronghold.<ref name=\"Lothl\u00f3rien\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 6 \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"}}</ref>\n\n====Geology====\n\nThe [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] excavated most of Khazad-d\u00fbm out of solid rock, leaving polished walls.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Minerals included [[gold]], [[gem]]s and [[iron ore]]. However the principal mineral was ''[[mithril]]'', a fabulously precious and versatile metal found nowhere else in Middle-earth. It was the source of Khazad-d\u00fbm's huge wealth, but ultimately [[#The Mines|its mining]] was the cause of its downfall. Beginning under the Silvertine, the Dwarves mined ever deeper, and down towards the roots of Mount Caradhras. There they unearthed the Balrog, which drove the Dwarves into exile.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nFar below even the deepest mines of the Dwarves lay a primordial underworld of tunnels, [[Subterranean river|streams]] and [[Underground lake|lakes]] in perpetual darkness, inhabited by primitive creatures.

During his reign, the precious metal mithril was discovered in the mines, and some of the major structures of Moria were built: Durin's Bridge, the Second Hall, the Endless Stair and Durin's Tower.

He won the 2003\u2013\u201904 Swedish Match Tour championship with 150 points. He followed that up with a come-from-behind victory in 2004\u2013\u201905.

After all, he is a three-time World Champion of Match Race Sailing. But he\u2019s also one of the most knowledgeable skippers on the Tour.\n\nThat knowledge comes not only from years on the match-race circuit, but also five different syndicates for the America\u2019s Cup. Gilmour\u2019s Cup career began with the 1987 defense in Perth, Western Australia, when he was the starting helmsman for [[Kevin Parry|Kevin Parry\u2019s]] Kookaburra syndicate, which ultimately lost the America\u2019s Cup.\n\nGilmour, however, had made his mark. During the Australian trials to select the Cup defender, Gilmour used the racing rules to his advantage and drew countless protests on his rivals. The members of the International Jury often found themselves sorting out protests well past when everyone had left the media center. Sometimes their decisions overturned previous day\u2019s results, which created chaos with the defense trials.\n\nGilmour\u2019s actions would ultimately lead to the creation of the Match Racing Rules, an appendix to the Racing Rules of Sailing. The goal of the new rules was to decide on-the-water infractions immediately through umpires in chase boats or on the competing boats.\n\nMr Gilmour was also inducted as the 2009 Chairman of the

He could play at either end of the ground as a [[key position]] [[forward-line|forward]] or [[Backline (football)|backman]]. After McCartney left the Magpies after four seasons from 1991\u20131994, he switched to [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]], with whom he had a good debut season in 1995. He missed out most of the year due to the strength of the team in 1997, therefore missing the Crows' first premiership triumph. So he moved to [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], where he played in the 1998 losing [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against the Crows. In 1999 he once again had the opportunity to play in a [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], but was suspended during the [[preliminary final]] against Brisbane saying that it was the worst day of his life, and went on to miss the Roos' premiership triumph that year. He then played in the team that made a losing preliminary final in 2000, which was the last [[AFL Finals Series|finals]] match he played, and could have been considered unlucky, considering circumstances, to have never played in a premiership. In 2002 he had a poor season after being forced to fill the key forward role vacated by champion [[Wayne Carey]] who did not compete in the 2002 season having left the club following a sex scandal with [[Anthony Stevens]]' wife.\n\n== Bali bombings ==\nOn 12 October 2002, McCartney was a victim of the [[2002 Bali bombing|Bali bombing]] near the [[Sari Club]]. He was drinking at a nearby pub called Paddy's Bar when the bomb exploded, causing McCartney and his companion, fellow AFL footballer [[Mick Martyn (Australian footballer)|Mick Martyn]], to suffer the impact of the blast. Martyn escaped with minor burns, while McCartney suffered severe second degree burns to over 50% of his body.<ref name=\"road\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/australian-rules-football-mccartney-realises-his-goal-at-end-of-long-and-painful-road-540179.html|title=US|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMcCartney initially thought his burns were minor and set about saving those around him instead of worrying about himself. He considered others to be in more pain than he was, and had to be taken on a special chartered flight back to Melbourne along with other victims. When he arrived the injuries turned out to be severe and McCartney almost died during surgery. He was awarded a [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] for his support to other victims.<ref>{{Cite It's an Honour |ausawardid=1044352 |date=17 October 2003 |recipient=Mr Jason Paul McCARTNEY  |award=Medal of the Order of Australia  |postnominal=OAM |citation=For service to the community, particularly through support for the recovery of victims and families affected by the bombings which occurred in Bali on 12 October 2002, and as a fundraiser for trauma services. |postscript= |accessdate=18 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWhat followed was a long rehabilitation process. McCartney stated that his objectives were to marry his fianc\u00e9e Nerissa, as planned, and also to return to [[Australian Football League|AFL]] football. The comeback was seen as an almost impossible task.\n\n==Return to AFL football==\nHe married fianc\u00e9e Nerissa Vanderheyden on 14 December, just 63 days after the bombings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/14/1039656259672.html|title=A post-Bali dream comes true - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}</ref> Throughout 2003, McCartney rehabilitated with the intention of regaining his place in the [[North Melbourne Football Club|Kangaroos]] on merit. Following an early season thigh strain, McCartney eventually played seven games with the Kangaroos' then-[[Victorian Football League|VFL]] affiliate [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] before gaining senior selection.\n\nOn 6 June 2003, McCartney returned to the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]. Playing for the [[Kangaroos Football Club|Kangaroos]] against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], McCartney was heavily bandaged, wore a long-sleeved top and had to wear protective gloves. McCartney wore the numbers \"88\" and \"202\" on his guernsey \u2013 88 representing the number of Australians who died in the Bali bombing, and 202 the total number of deaths, with many in the crowd also holding up the numbers on signs.<ref name=\"road\" />\n\nMcCartney had the modest statistics of 3 kicks, 1 mark and 1 goal, 1 behind. He booted a goal early in the final quarter, but with the Kangaroos trailing by less than a goal late in the game, McCartney dished off the ball to [[Leigh Harding]], who scored the winning goal with seconds remaining.\n\nIn a real twist to the night, McCartney announced his retirement from [[Australian Football League|AFL]] football during his on-field post-match interview, citing that his road back had left him spent and that he preferred to leave on a high note.

The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.\n:2. {{note|b}} In 2009, Croatia qualified through the back-up jury selection. \n:3. If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. If, for example, Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the countries who placed 11th and 12th were advanced to the following year's grand final along with the rest of the top ten countries. Serbia & Montenegro decided to withdraw from the competition even tho they finished in the top ten the previous year, so the country that placed 11th (which was Croatia) got the spot in the final instead.</small>\n\n==Awards==\n===Barbara Dex Award===\n{{further|Barbara Dex Award}}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Host city\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{Escyr|2016}}\n|[[Nina Kralji\u0107]]\n|{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Stockholm]]\n|{{center|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2016/05/22/barbara-dex-award-2016-nina-kraljic-wins-eurovisions-worst-dressed/142524/|title=Barbara Dex Award 2016: Croatia\u2019s Nina Kraljic tops Eurovision\u2019s Worst Dressed list|publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]]|date=22 May 2016|accessdate=8 December 2019|first=William Lee|last=Adams}}</ref>}}\n|}\n\n==Related involvement==\n===Heads of delegation===\nThe public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event.

The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.\n:2. {{note|b}} In 2009, Croatia qualified through the back-up jury selection. \n:3. If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year.
