At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values). It also contends that humans possess generative grammar, which is hard-wired into the human brain in some ways and makes it possible for young children to do the rapid and universal acquisition of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert K |title=The extended mind : the emergence of language, the human mind, and culture |date=2007 |publisher=Toronto : University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802093035 }}</ref> Elements of linguistic variation then determine the growth of language in the individual, and variation is the result of experience, given the genetic endowment and independent principles reducing complexity.\n\n=====Language Acquisition Device=====\n\n{{Main|Language Acquisition}}\n\nProposed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was purported to be an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant, species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters.

These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\".

[[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n=== Biolinguistics: challenging the Usage-Based approach ===\nAs mentioned above, Biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the Biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>.\n\n==Researchers in Biolinguistics==\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[https://massimo.sbs.arizona.edu Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, University of Arizona]\n*[[Michael Arbib]], [[University of Southern California]]\n*[[Philip Lieberman]], [[Brown University]]\n*[[Ray C.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology.

Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Researchers in Biolinguistics==\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[https://massimo.sbs.arizona.edu Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, University of Arizona]\n*[[Michael Arbib]], [[University of Southern California]]\n*[[Philip Lieberman]], [[Brown University]]\n*[[Ray C.

Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters.

In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\".

'''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n=== Biolinguistics: challenging the Usage-Based approach ===\nAs mentioned above, Biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the Biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n*[[Generative grammar|Generative Grammar]]\n*[[Minimalist program|Minimalist Program]]\n*[[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]]\n*[[Biosemiotics]]\n*[[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n*[[Neurolinguistics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Conferences===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070220115531/http://www.biolinguistics.net/ Biolinguistic Investigations Conference, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, February 2007.]\n*[http://www.biolinguistics.uqam.ca Conference on Biolinguistics: Language Evolution and Variation, Universit\u00e0 di Venezia, June 2007.]\n*[http://stel.ub.edu/symposium/ ICREA International Symposium in Biolinguistics, Universitat de Barcelona, October 2012.]\n*[http://www.biolinguistics.eu ''The Journal of Biolinguistics'']\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics Biolinguistics Journal]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Syntax]]\n[[Category:Noam Chomsky]]\n[[Category:Branches of linguistics]]\n[[Category:Cognitive science]]\n", "name_user": "MariaSam98", "label": "safe", "comment": "stylistic edits and links added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biolinguistics"}

From 20:33 \u2013 20:47 EDT (00:33 to 00:47 UTC), the aircraft experienced a radio blackout for approximately thirteen minutes, which was later found to be caused by communication radio tuning errors.<ref name=\"Mayday Fire On Board\">{{Cite episode |title=Fire on Board|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|season=1|number=3|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nAt 22:10 [[Atlantic Time Zone|AT]] (01:10 UTC, 52 minutes after takeoff), the flight crew detected an odor in the cockpit and determined it to be smoke from the air conditioning system. Four minutes later, the odor returned and smoke became visible, prompting the pilots to make a \"[[pan-pan]]\" radio call to Moncton [[air traffic control]], the [[Area control center|area control center (ACC)]] station in charge of air traffic over the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The pan-pan call indicated that there was an urgency due to smoke in the cockpit but did not declare an emergency as denoted by a \"[[Mayday]]\" call. The crew requested a diversion to [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston ({{convert|234|nmi|km mi}} away) before accepting Moncton ATC's offer of radar vectors to the closer [[Halifax International Airport]] in [[Enfield, Nova Scotia]], {{convert|66|nmi|km mi}} away.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|1\u20132}}\n\nAt 22:18 AT (01:18 UTC), Moncton Centre handed over traffic control of the plane to [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax]] terminal air traffic control, the ATC station in charge of controlling traffic in and out of Halifax International Airport. Upon being advised by Halifax ATC that they were 30 nautical miles (56&nbsp;km) from the airport, the crew requested more flight distance to allow the aircraft to descend safely from its altitude of {{Convert|21000|ft|m|abbr=}} at the time. The crew then requested to dump fuel to reduce their weight for landing. Halifax thus vectored the plane south toward [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margaret's Bay]]<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|2\u20133}} where it was safe for the aircraft to dump fuel while remaining within 40 nautical miles of the airport.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|3}}\n\nIn accordance with the Swissair checklist 'In case of smoke of unknown origin', the crew shut off power to the cabin, which also turned off the recirculating fans in the cabin's ceiling. This allowed the fire to spread to the cockpit, eventually shutting off power to the aircraft's [[autopilot]]. At 22:24:28 AT (01:24:28 UTC), the crew informed Halifax that \"we now must fly manually\", followed by declaring an emergency. Ten seconds later, the crew declared an emergency again, saying \"...and we are declaring emergency now, Swissair one eleven\"; this was the last transmission received from Flight 111.<ref name=\"cvr980902\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/cvr980902.htm|title=Air traffic control transcript for Swissair 111|date=2 September 1998|website=PlaneCrashInfo.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621132915/http://www.planecrashinfo.com/cvr980902.htm|archive-date=21 June 2016|access-date=19 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft [[flight data recorder]] stopped operating at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the [[cockpit voice recorder]].

The first and most prominent was:\n\n{{quote|\nAircraft certification standards for material flammability were inadequate in that they allowed the use of materials that could be ignited and sustain or propagate fire. Consequently, flammable material propagated a fire that started above the ceiling on the right side of the cockpit near the cockpit rear wall. The fire spread and intensified rapidly to the extent that it degraded aircraft systems and the cockpit environment, and ultimately led to the loss of control of the aircraft.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|253}}\n}}\n\nInvestigators identified evidence of [[Electric arc|arcing]] in wiring of the in-flight entertainment network, but this did not trip the [[circuit breaker]]s, which were not [[Arc-fault circuit interrupter|designed to trip on arcing.]] The investigation was unable to determine whether this arc was the \"lead event\" that was assumed to have ignited the flammable covering on [[Metallized polyethylene terephthalate|MPET]] insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|253}} After the crew cut power to \"non-essential\" cabin systems, a reverse flow in the cockpit ventilation ducts increased the amount of smoke reaching the flight deck.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|240}} By the time the crew became aware of the severity of the fire, it had become so extensive that it was impossible to address as it happened.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|254}}\n\nThe rapid spread of electrical power failures led to the breakdown of key avionics systems, and the crew was soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. The pilot-in-command was forced to fly manually because he had no light by which to see his controls after the instrument lighting failed. The fuel-laden plane was above maximum landing weight; as the flight crew dumped fuel as per procedure, they lost all control, and the doomed plane flew into the ocean uncommanded. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that aluminium parts in the flight deck ceiling had melted. The recovered [[attitude indicator|standby attitude indicator]] and [[airspeed indicator]]s showed that the aircraft struck the water at {{Convert|300|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} in a 20 degrees nose down and \n110-degree bank attitude; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity (\"g\" force).<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|103}} Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|104}}\n\n=== Safety recommendations ===\nThe TSB made nine recommendations relating to changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in Federal Aviation Authority standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.\n\n===Identification===\nThe [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] medical examiners positively identified most of the bodies within ten weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces, only one body was identifiable by sight.

From 20:33 \u2013 20:47 EDT (00:33 to 00:47 UTC), the aircraft experienced a radio blackout for approximately thirteen minutes, which was later found to be caused by communication radio tuning errors.<ref name=\"Mayday Fire On Board\">{{Cite episode |title=Fire on Board|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|season=1|number=3|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nAt 22:10 [[Atlantic Time Zone|AT]] (01:10 UTC, 52 minutes after takeoff), the flight crew detected an odor in the cockpit and determined it to be smoke from the air conditioning system. Four minutes later, the odor returned and smoke became visible, prompting the pilots to make a \"[[pan-pan]]\" radio call to Moncton [[air traffic control]], the [[Area control center|area control center (ACC)]] station in charge of air traffic over the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The pan-pan call indicated that there was an urgency due to smoke in the cockpit but did not declare an emergency as denoted by a \"[[Mayday]]\" call. The crew requested a diversion to [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston ({{convert|234|nmi|km mi}} away) before accepting Moncton ATC's offer of radar vectors to the closer [[Halifax International Airport]] in [[Enfield, Nova Scotia]], {{convert|66|nmi|km mi}} away.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|1\u20132}}\n\nAt 22:18 AT (01:18 UTC), Moncton Centre handed over traffic control of the plane to [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax]] terminal air traffic control, the ATC station in charge of controlling traffic in and out of Halifax International Airport. Upon being advised by Halifax ATC that they were 30 nautical miles (56&nbsp;km) from the airport, the crew requested more flight distance to allow the aircraft to descend safely from its altitude of {{Convert|21000|ft|m|abbr=}} at the time. The crew then requested to dump fuel to reduce their weight for landing. Halifax thus vectored the plane south toward [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margaret's Bay]]<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|2\u20133}} where it was safe for the aircraft to dump fuel while remaining within 40 nautical miles of the airport.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|3}}\n\nIn accordance with the Swissair checklist 'In case of smoke of unknown origin', the crew shut off power to the cabin, which also turned off the recirculating fans in the cabin's ceiling. This allowed the fire to spread to the cockpit, eventually shutting off power to the aircraft's [[autopilot]]. At 22:24:28 AT (01:24:28 UTC), the crew informed Halifax that \"we now must fly manually\", followed by declaring an emergency. Ten seconds later, the crew declared an emergency again, saying \"...and we are declaring emergency now, Swissair one eleven\"; this was the last transmission received from Flight 111.<ref name=\"cvr980902\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/cvr980902.htm|title=Air traffic control transcript for Swissair 111|date=2 September 1998|website=PlaneCrashInfo.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621132915/http://www.planecrashinfo.com/cvr980902.htm|archive-date=21 June 2016|access-date=19 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft [[flight data recorder]] stopped operating at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the [[cockpit voice recorder]].

The first and most prominent was:\n\n{{quote|\nAircraft certification standards for material flammability were inadequate in that they allowed the use of materials that could be ignited and sustain or propagate fire. Consequently, flammable material propagated a fire that started above the ceiling on the right side of the cockpit near the cockpit rear wall. The fire spread and intensified rapidly to the extent that it degraded aircraft systems and the cockpit environment, and ultimately led to the loss of control of the aircraft.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|253}}\n}}\n\nInvestigators identified evidence of [[Electric arc|arcing]] in wiring of the in-flight entertainment network, but this did not trip the [[circuit breaker]]s, which were not [[Arc-fault circuit interrupter|designed to trip on arcing.]] The investigation was unable to determine whether this arc was the \"lead event\" that was assumed to have ignited the flammable covering on [[Metallized polyethylene terephthalate|MPET]] insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|253}} After the crew cut power to \"non-essential\" cabin systems, a reverse flow in the cockpit ventilation ducts increased the amount of smoke reaching the flight deck.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|240}} By the time the crew became aware of the severity of the fire, it had become so extensive that it was impossible to address as it happened.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|254}}\n\nThe rapid spread of electrical power failures led to the breakdown of key avionics systems, and the crew was soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. The pilot-in-command was forced to fly manually because he had no light by which to see his controls after the instrument lighting failed. The fuel-laden plane was above maximum landing weight; as the flight crew dumped fuel as per procedure, they lost all control, and the doomed plane flew into the ocean uncommanded. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that aluminium parts in the flight deck ceiling had melted. The recovered [[attitude indicator|standby attitude indicator]] and [[airspeed indicator]]s showed that the aircraft struck the water at {{Convert|300|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} in a 20 degrees nose down and \n110-degree bank attitude; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity (\"g\" force).<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|103}} Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.<ref name=\"A98H0003 Final Report\" />{{rp|104}}\n\n=== Safety recommendations ===\nThe TSB made nine recommendations relating to changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in Federal Aviation Authority standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.\n\n===Identification===\nThe [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] medical examiners positively identified most of the bodies within ten weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces, only one body was identifiable by sight. [[DNA#DNA profiling|DNA profiling]] was used to identify approximately one hundred bodies, in what has been referred to as<!--Source doesn't actually say where it was referred to as such--> \"the largest DNA identification project ever undertaken in Canada\".<ref name=cmaj>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/160/2/241.full.pdf|title=229 people, 15 000 body parts: pathologists help solve Swissair 111's grisly puzzles|first=Nancy|last=Robb|journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]|volume=160|issue=2|pages=241\u2013243|date=26 January 1999|access-date=10 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508191102/http://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/160/2/241.full.pdf|archive-date=8 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to request medical histories and dental records. They were also asked to provide blood samples for genetic matching in the DNA identification of the victims. About 90 bodies were identified by the medical examiners using dental records; due to the large number of [[wiktionary:antemortem|ante-mortem]] (before death) dental X-rays available to the examiners, these bodies were able to be identified by late-October 1998.

The last MD-11 freighter was delivered to [[Lufthansa Cargo]] in 2001.\n\nThe crash of Flight 111 was a severe blow to Swissair, particularly as the [[in-flight entertainment]] system that was blamed for causing the accident had been installed on the aircraft to attract more passengers, in order to ease the airline's financial difficulties. Swissair went bankrupt shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, an event that caused a significant and widespread disruption to the aviation transportation industry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Swissair Takes a Gamble on New System|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-31/business/fi-29756_1_interactive-systems|access-date=6 May 2016|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=31 July 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603150557/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-31/business/fi-29756_1_interactive-systems|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter the crash of Flight 111, the [[Flight number#flight designator|flight designator]] for Swissair's New York\u2013Geneva route was changed to SR139, although the route was still operated by MD-11 aircraft.

The [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) were given leave to subscribe to the undertaking but they chose not to and the MS&LR found help from [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) instead.{{efn|name=fn1}}{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=210}}\n[[File:Ashley Railway Station.jpg|thumb|left|Ashley Railway Station]]\n\nIn 1861 a further Act modified the route and provided for the official involvement of the MS&LR.{{efn|name=fn2}}\n\nTogether the MSLR and GNR formed a [[Joint railway|joint committee]] to operate this railway along with three others that had been authorised but were not yet open.{{efn|They were the [[Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway]], the [[Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway]] and the [[West Cheshire Railway]]}}  Together these railways connected up to provide an alternative route into North Cheshire that avoided Manchester. \n\nEach company was to provide an equal amount of capital and four representatives to the joint management committee. This arrangement was confirmed by the Great Northern (Cheshire Lines) Act in Parliament in 1863.{{efn|name=fn3}} This Act had not, however, formally set up a separate legal body, providing instead for the two companies to manage and work the four railways through their existing structures.{{sfn|Griffiths|Goode|1978|p=3}}{{sfn|Dyckhoff|1999|p=22}}\n\nThis arrangement eventually led to the formation of the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] in 1865.

In fact, he says he was so unprepared for the start of hostility that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and lost touch with the party for a couple of days.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 215-222.</ref>\n\nLi Weilun, an [[Esperanto]] professor at the [[Beijing Language and Culture University]], was born in Sungai Siput in 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espero.com.cn/2013-07/19/content_29470963.htm |title=Esperanto kaj la vivo en la Pekina Lingva Universitato |last=Fiocchi |first=Pietro |date= 2013-07-19 |website=El Popola \u0108inio |publisher= |access-date= 2017-12-19 |quote=Nia samideano naski\u011dis en 1936 en Malajzio, en la urbo Sungai Sipud. }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Sungai Siput , 2010 census\n|-\n!
