Hosted at [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1996, it was contested by [[D.C. United]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] to decide the champion of the [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996 season]].\n\nBoth finalists finished in the top two spots of their respective conferences, with D.C. placing second in the East and Los Angeles atop the West. The two teams also had identical [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss]] records in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing the opening match of the Conference Semifinals and winning the remaining four matches of both rounds. The final match was played in heavy rain due to the proximity of [[Hurricane Lili (1996)|Hurricane Lili]], which also inundated the field. The MLS Cup had an attendance of 34,643 spectators, falling short of the 42,000 people who paid for tickets, and included a large contingent of traveling D.C. supporters.\n\nThe match ended in a 3\u20132 victory for D.C. United, with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Eddie Pope]] in overtime that followed a second-half comeback for the team. Los Angeles had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the 56th minute on goals by [[Eduardo Hurtado]] and [[Chris Armas]], but conceded two goals to D.C. in the second half to force overtime. [[Marco Etcheverry]] assisted both goals, which began as [[free kick]]s that were headed into the goal by substitutes [[Tony Sanneh]] and [[Shawn Medved]]. Etcheverry went on to take the [[corner kick]] that led to Pope's goal and was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]]. The finalists also earned a berth in the [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and met in the semifinals, which ended in a victory for the Galaxy.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:Foxborostade crop 1.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Foxboro Stadium]], the host venue of MLS Cup 1996|alt=Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium with a soccer field surrounded on two sides by three sets of yellow and blue stands, and on two sides by smaller stands.]]\n\n[[Foxboro Stadium]] in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], was announced as the venue of the inaugural MLS Cup during a league press conference on August 29, 1996.

Hosted at [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1996, it was contested by [[D.C.

The two teams also had identical [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss]] records in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing the opening match of the Conference Semifinals and winning the remaining four matches of both rounds. The final match was played in heavy rain due to the proximity of [[Hurricane Lili (1996)|Hurricane Lili]], which also inundated the field. The MLS Cup had an attendance of 34,643 spectators, falling short of the 42,000 people who paid for tickets, and included a large contingent of traveling D.C. supporters.\n\nThe match ended in a 3\u20132 victory for D.C. United, with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Eddie Pope]] in overtime that followed a second-half comeback for the team. Los Angeles had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the 56th minute on goals by [[Eduardo Hurtado]] and [[Chris Armas]], but conceded two goals to D.C. in the second half to force overtime. [[Marco Etcheverry]] assisted both goals, which began as [[free kick]]s that were headed into the goal by substitutes [[Tony Sanneh]] and [[Shawn Medved]]. Etcheverry went on to take the [[corner kick]] that led to Pope's goal and was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]]. The finalists also earned a berth in the [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and met in the semifinals, which ended in a victory for the Galaxy.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:Foxborostade crop 1.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Foxboro Stadium]], the host venue of MLS Cup 1996|alt=Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium with a soccer field surrounded on two sides by three sets of yellow and blue stands, and on two sides by smaller stands.]]\n\n[[Foxboro Stadium]] in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], was announced as the venue of the inaugural MLS Cup during a league press conference on August 29, 1996.

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|12|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|9|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|3|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/16|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 16|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\".

[[Vlaho Bukovac]] organized painters society in [[Zagreb]] with many exhibitions, while in [[Belgrade]] Kirilo Kutlik set up the first school of art in 1895. Secession artists [[Hinko Smrekar]] and [[Maksim Gaspari]] produced mostly graphics, while [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]] became known as a sculptor.\n\n==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==\nWith the formation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes [[Avantgarde]] took primacy in Yugoslav arts. Modern currents as [[expressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]] emerged with new young artists like [[Petar Dobrovi\u0107]], [[Jovan Bijeli\u0107]], [[Milo Milunovi\u0107]], [[Sava \u0160umanovi\u0107]], [[Stane Kregar]] and [[Gojmir Anton Kos]]. Later, with the political crisis in the 1930s, social themes emerged with critical attitude to old forms. [[Mirko Kuja\u010di\u0107]] wrote a ''A Manifesto of Zenitism'', while [[Krsto Hegedu\u0161i\u0107]] founded a radical group ''Zemlja'' in Zagreb. In Trieste, [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] was strong with Slovenian painter [[Avgust \u010cernigoj]]. Institutionally Yugoslav art was supported by new Art Academy in Zagreb and Belgrade School of Painting. Sculpture was not as developed as painting and it stayed mostly under the old influence of [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]]. Other notable sculptor of this era was [[Antun Augustin\u010di\u0107]].\n\n==Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia==\nNot much art was produced during the [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], with mostly partisan graphics being preserved. After the war old styles and techniques persisted until esthetic utilitarism and [[social realism]] were introduced with the new socialist system. In 1950s new avantgarde and fantastic elements emerged once again with the esthetics of shock. In the time of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] no single dominate style existed with many new institutions and societies being formed in Ljubljana, Zagreb, Belgrade and other bigger cities. Special phenomenon, recognized also abroad, was self-taught naive school in [[Hlebine]] with [[Ivan Generali\u0107]]. On the other side academic approach became prevalent, forming many courses and experimenting with geometry, magic, colors, photographic realism and other elements.

According to art critic Rikki Byrd: \"Positioning black women \u2014 artists, actresses, characters, and her own family \u2014 as mentors and muses, and as heroic figures in a lineage of their own, Thomas overrides oppressive narratives.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Byrd|first=Rikki|date=November 27, 2017|title=Mickalene Thomas Makes Black Women the Protagonists of Their Own Stories|url=https://hyperallergic.com/413543/mickalene-thomas-makes-black-women-the-protagonists-of-their-own-stories/|journal=Hyperallergic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe many years that Thomas has spent studying art history, portrait painting, landscape painting, and still life has informed her work. She has drawn inspiration from multiple artistic periods and cultural influences throughout Western art history, particularly the early modernists such as [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and [[Romare Bearden]]. She models her figures on the classical poses and abstract settings popularized by these modern artists as a way to reclaim agency for women who have been represented as objects to be desired or subjugated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landers|first=Sean|date=Summer 2011|title=Mickalene Thomas|url=|journal=Bomb|volume=no. 116|pages=30\u201338|via=EBSCO HOST}}</ref>\n\nThomas is known for her elaborate mixed-media paintings composed of rhinestones, acrylic, and enamel that present a \"complex vision of what it means to be a woman and expands common definitions of beauty.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://pier24.org/lecture/mickalene-thomas/|title=Mickalene Thomas|website=Pier 24|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> Rhinestones serve as an added layer of meaning and a metaphor for artifice. Rhinestones accentuate specific elements of each painting, while subtly confronting our assumptions of what is feminine and what defines a woman, specifically black women.\n\n\tThomas's subjects are virtually always women of color; a means to portray and empower the women and celebrate their culture and beauty\u2014sometimes by incorporating them into iconic Western paintings. As a member of, and inspired by, the [[Post-black art|Post-Black]] Art movement, Thomas' work redefines perceptions of race, gender, and sexuality.<ref name=\":2\" /> Thomas blurs the distinction between object and subject, concrete and abstract, real and imaginary. Her subjects often look directly at the viewer, challenging the dominance of the [[male gaze]] in art.<ref name=\":2\" /> This assertive portrayal indicates that the models are at ease in their own skin, thus challenging the stereotype of the silent and inferior woman objectified by the viewer's gaze. In addition, seemingly insignificant decisions (like not straightening the figures\u2019 hair) have the important effect of encouraging women of color to accept themselves as they are and not conform to a particular ideology of beauty imposed by society.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Derek Conrad|date=March 2014|title=Mickalene Thomas|journal=American Art|volume=28|issue=1|pages=9\u201315|doi=10.1086/676624|issn=1073-9300}}</ref>\n\n\tThomas's work is also distinctive in its foregrounding of queer identity; she is a queer woman of color representing women of color in a way that emphasizes their agency and erotic beauty.  By emphasizing the women's striking presence and sensuality along with their assertive gazes, Thomas empowers these subjects, representing them as resilient, stunning women who command the spectator's attention. The sitters have the control and power of the gaze, and when this exchange is between women, it subverts the traditional dominance of the male gaze in art and visual culture.  Thomas's queer identity is foregrounded, for example, in her painting and print edition entitled ''Sleep: Deux femmes noires'' (2012 and 2013), in which we see two female bodies intertwined in an embrace, on a sofa, thus highlighting for her audience the femininity, beauty, and sexuality of women lovers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valdez|first=Crystal|date=2012|title=Visions|url=|journal=Art in America|volume=100|issue=9|pages=114\u20131212|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref>\n\n=== Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur l'Herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires ===\n[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/mickalene-thomas-ushering-new-wave-contemporary-art-180967496/ ''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires''] is a painting created by African-American visual artist Mickalene Thomas.

Inhabiting the '70s-style genre of [[Blaxploitation]], the subjects in Thomas's paintings and collages radiate sexuality, which has been interpreted by some as satire of misogynistic and racist tropes in media, including films and music associated with the [[Blaxploitation]] genre.<ref name=\":2\"/> Women in provocative poses dominate the picture plane and are surrounded by decorative patterns inspired by her childhood<ref>Dailey, Meghan, \"In the Studio: Mickalene Thomas\", ''Art + Auction'', March 2009.</ref> as in ''Left Behind 2 Again'' from 2012, in the collection of the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]].

According to art critic Rikki Byrd: \"Positioning black women \u2014 artists, actresses, characters, and her own family \u2014 as mentors and muses, and as heroic figures in a lineage of their own, Thomas overrides oppressive narratives.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Byrd|first=Rikki|date=November 27, 2017|title=Mickalene Thomas Makes Black Women the Protagonists of Their Own Stories|url=https://hyperallergic.com/413543/mickalene-thomas-makes-black-women-the-protagonists-of-their-own-stories/|journal=Hyperallergic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe many years that Thomas has spent studying art history, portrait painting, landscape painting, and still life has informed her work. She has drawn inspiration from multiple artistic periods and cultural influences throughout Western art history, particularly the early modernists such as [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and [[Romare Bearden]]. She models her figures on the classical poses and abstract settings popularized by these modern artists as a way to reclaim agency for women who have been represented as objects to be desired or subjugated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landers|first=Sean|date=Summer 2011|title=Mickalene Thomas|url=|journal=Bomb|volume=no. 116|pages=30\u201338|via=EBSCO HOST}}</ref>\n\nThomas is known for her elaborate mixed-media paintings composed of rhinestones, acrylic, and enamel that present a \"complex vision of what it means to be a woman and expands common definitions of beauty.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://pier24.org/lecture/mickalene-thomas/|title=Mickalene Thomas|website=Pier 24|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> Rhinestones serve as an added layer of meaning and a metaphor for artifice. Rhinestones accentuate specific elements of each painting, while subtly confronting our assumptions of what is feminine and what defines a woman, specifically black women.\n\n\tThomas's subjects are virtually always women of color; a means to portray and empower the women and celebrate their culture and beauty\u2014sometimes by incorporating them into iconic Western paintings. As a member of, and inspired by, the [[Post-black art|Post-Black]] Art movement, Thomas' work redefines perceptions of race, gender, and sexuality.<ref name=\":2\" /> Thomas blurs the distinction between object and subject, concrete and abstract, real and imaginary. Her subjects often look directly at the viewer, challenging the dominance of the [[male gaze]] in art.<ref name=\":2\" /> This assertive portrayal indicates that the models are at ease in their own skin, thus challenging the stereotype of the silent and inferior woman objectified by the viewer's gaze. In addition, seemingly insignificant decisions (like not straightening the figures\u2019 hair) have the important effect of encouraging women of color to accept themselves as they are and not conform to a particular ideology of beauty imposed by society.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Derek Conrad|date=March 2014|title=Mickalene Thomas|journal=American Art|volume=28|issue=1|pages=9\u201315|doi=10.1086/676624|issn=1073-9300}}</ref>\n\n\tThomas's work is also distinctive in its foregrounding of queer identity; she is a queer woman of color representing women of color in a way that emphasizes their agency and erotic beauty.  By emphasizing the women's striking presence and sensuality along with their assertive gazes, Thomas empowers these subjects, representing them as resilient, stunning women who command the spectator's attention. The sitters have the control and power of the gaze, and when this exchange is between women, it subverts the traditional dominance of the male gaze in art and visual culture.  Thomas's queer identity is foregrounded, for example, in her painting and print edition entitled ''Sleep: Deux femmes noires'' (2012 and 2013), in which we see two female bodies intertwined in an embrace, on a sofa, thus highlighting for her audience the femininity, beauty, and sexuality of women lovers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valdez|first=Crystal|date=2012|title=Visions|url=|journal=Art in America|volume=100|issue=9|pages=114\u20131212|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref>\n\n=== Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur l'Herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires ===\n[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/mickalene-thomas-ushering-new-wave-contemporary-art-180967496/ ''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires''] is a painting created by African-American visual artist Mickalene Thomas.
