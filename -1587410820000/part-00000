Note that if {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} ''j''}}, the sequence is empty.\n\nFor {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S'' \u00d7 ''S''}}, define a new function ''F''<sub>''l''</sub> on finite nonempty sequences of elements of ''S'', where\n\n:<math>F_l(\\mathbf{a}_{0,k})=\n\\begin{cases}\na_0, &k=1\\\\\nf(F_l(\\mathbf{a}_{0,k-1}), a_{k-1}), &k>1\n\\end{cases}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, define\n\n:<math>F_r(\\mathbf{a}_{0,k})=\n\\begin{cases}\na_0, &k=1\\\\\nf(a_0, F_r(\\mathbf{a}_{1,k})), &k>1\n\\end{cases}.</math>\n\nIf ''f'' has a unique left identity ''e'', the definition of ''F''<sub>''l''</sub> can be modified to operate on empty sequences by defining the value of ''F''<sub>''l''</sub> on an empty sequence to be ''e'' (the previous base case on sequences of length 1 becomes redundant). Similarly, ''F''<sub>''r''</sub> can be modified to operate on empty sequences if ''f'' has a unique right identity.\n\nIf ''f'' is associative, then ''F''<sub>''l''</sub> equals ''F''<sub>''r''</sub>{{space|hair}}, and we can simply write ''F''.  Moreover, if an identity element ''e'' exists, then it is unique (see [[Monoid]]).\n\nIf ''f'' is [[commutative]] and associative, then ''F'' can operate on any non-empty finite [[multiset]] by applying it to an arbitrary enumeration of the multiset.  If ''f'' moreover has an identity element ''e'', then this is defined to be the value of ''F'' on an empty multiset.

Thus, e.g., if ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;... is an infinite sequence of [[real number]]s, then the [[infinite product]]&nbsp;<math>\\prod_{i=0}^\\infty a_i\\,</math> is defined, and equal to <math>\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\prod_{i=0}^na_i,</math>&nbsp; if and only if that limit exists.\n\n==Non-associative binary operation==\nThe general, non-associative binary operation is given by a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]]. The act of iterating on a non-associative binary operation may be represented as a [[binary tree]].\n\n==Notation==\n\nIterated binary operations are used to represent an operation that will be repeated over a set subject to some constraints. Typically the lower bound of a restriction is written under the symbol, and the upper bound over the symbol, though they may also be written as superscripts and subscripts in compact notation.  Interpolation is performed over positive [[integer]]s from the lower to upper bound, to produce the set which will be substituted into the index (below denoted as ''i''{{space|hair}}) for the repeated operations.  It is possible to specify set membership or other logical constraints in place of explicit indices, in order to implicitly specify which elements of a set shall be used.\n\nCommon notations include the big '''S'''igma ([[Summation|repeated '''s'''um]]) and big '''P'''i ([[Product (mathematics)|repeated '''p'''roduct]]) notations.\n\n<math>\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = 0+1+2+ \\dots + (n-1)</math>\n\n<math>\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} i = 0 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times (n-1)</math>\n\nThough [[binary operators]] including but not limited to [[exclusive or]] and [[set union]] may be used.<ref>{{cite web|last1=W.|first1=Weisstein, Eric|title=Union|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|accessdate=30 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLet ''S'' be a set of sets\n\n<math>\\bigcup_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 \\cup s_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup s_N.</math>\n\nLet ''S'' be a set of logical [[proposition]]s\n\n<math>\\bigoplus_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 \\oplus s_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus s_N.</math>{{clarify|reason=explain what this notation means}}\n\nLet ''S'' be a set of [[multivector]]s in a [[Clifford algebra]]/[[geometric algebra]]\n\n<math>\\bigwedge_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 \\wedge s_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge s_N,</math>\n\n<math>\\prod_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 s_2 \\dots s_N.</math>\n\nNote how in the above, no upper bound is used, because it suffices to express that the elements <math>s_i</math> are elements of the set ''S''.\n\nIt is also to produce a repeated operation given a number of constraint joined by a [[logical and| conjunction (and)]], for example:\n\n<math>\\sum_{(i \\in 2\\mathbb{N}) \\wedge (i \\leq n)} i = 0 + 2 + 4 + \\dots + n,</math> which may also be denoted <math>\\sum_{\\begin{array}{c} i \\in 2\\mathbb{N} \\\\ i \\leq n \\end{array}} i = 0 + 2 + 4 + \\dots + n.</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Continued fraction]]\n*[[Fold (higher-order function)]]\n*[[Infinite product]]\n*[[Infinite series]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181156/http://www.short-fuze.co.uk/~eddy/math/associate.html Bulk action] <!-- archived from the original -->\n* [http://wotug.ukc.ac.uk/parallel/acronyms/hpccgloss/P.html#parallel%20prefix Parallel prefix operation]\n* [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/sfa/Nuprl/iterated_binops/Xiter_via_intseg_remark_INTRO.html Nuprl iterated binary operations]\n[[Category:Binary operations]]\n", "text_old": "In [[mathematics]], an '''iterated binary operation''' is an extension of a [[binary operation]] on a set  ''S'' to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on finite [[sequence]]s of elements of ''S'' through repeated application.<ref name=IBO1>{{cite book|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician |author= Saunders MacLane |page=142 |location=New York |publisher= Springer-Verlag |date= 1971 |isbn=0387900357}}</ref> Common examples include the extension of the [[addition]] operation to the [[summation]] operation, and the extension of the [[multiplication]] operation to the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] operation.

Interpolation is performed over positive integers from the lower to upper bound, to produce the set which will be substituted into the index (below denoted as i) for the repeated operations.  It is possible to specify set membership or other logical constraints in place of explicit indices, in order to implicitly specify which elements of a set shall be used.\n\nCommon notations include the big '''S'''igma ( [[summation|repeated '''s'''um]] ) and big '''P'''i notations( [[Product (mathematics)|repeated '''p'''roduct]] ) notations.\n\n<math>\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = 0+1+2+ \\dots + (n-1)</math>\n\n\n\n<math>\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} i = 0 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times (n-1)</math>\n\nThough [[binary operators]] including but not limited to [[exclusive or]] and [[set union]] may be used.<ref>{{cite web|last1=W.|first1=Weisstein, Eric|title=Union|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|accessdate=30 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLet S be a set of sets\n\n<math>\\bigcup_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 \\cup s_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup s_N</math>\n\nLet S be a set of logical [[proposition|propositions]]\n\n<math>\\bigoplus_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 \\oplus s_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus s_N</math>\n\nLet S be a set of [[multivector|multivectors]] in a [[Clifford algebra]]/[[geometric algebra]]\n\n<math>\\bigwedge_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 \\wedge s_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge s_N</math>\n\n<math>\\prod_{s \\in S} s_i= s_1 s_2 \\dots s_N</math>\n\nNote how in the above, no upper bound is used, because it suffices to express that the elements <math>s_i</math> are elements of the set S.\n\nIt is also to produce a repeated operation given a number of constraint joined by a [[logical and| conjunction (and)]], for example:\n\n<math>\\sum_{(i \\in 2\\mathbb{N}) \\wedge (i \\leq n)} i = 0+2+4+\\dots+ n</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Continued fraction]]\n*[[Fold (higher-order function)]]\n*[[Infinite product]]\n*[[Infinite series]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181156/http://www.short-fuze.co.uk/~eddy/math/associate.html Bulk action] <!-- archived from the original -->\n* [http://wotug.ukc.ac.uk/parallel/acronyms/hpccgloss/P.html#parallel%20prefix Parallel prefix operation]\n* [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/sfa/Nuprl/iterated_binops/Xiter_via_intseg_remark_INTRO.html Nuprl iterated binary operations]\n[[Category:Binary operations]]\n", "name_user": "Joel Brennan", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor formatting and added [clarify] tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_binary_operation"}

Museum trustees hired architect [[Guy Lowell]] to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell's [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] design was completed. It featured a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} [[fa\u00e7ade]] of [[granite]] and a grand [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. The museum moved to its new location later in 1909.\n\nThe second phase of construction built a wing along [[The Fens (Boston, Massachusetts)|The Fens]] to house paintings galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy [[business magnate]] Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist [[John Singer Sargent]] painted the [[fresco]]es that adorn the rotunda and the associated [[colonnades]].\n\nThe Decorative Arts Wing was built in 1928, and expanded in 1968.  An addition designed by [[Hugh Stubbins]] and Associates was built in 1966\u20131970, and another expansion by [[The Architects Collaborative]] opened in 1976.  The West Wing, now the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, was designed by [[I. M. Pei]] and opened in 1981. This wing now houses the museum's cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces. \n\n[[File:Japanese gate and garden at Boston Museum of Fine Arts - August 15, 2015.jpg|right|thumb|''Tenshin-en'', the museum's Japanese garden]]\nThe Tenshin-En Japanese Garden designed by Kinsaku Nakane opened in 1988, and the Norma Jean Calderwood Garden Court and Terrace opened in 1997.<ref name=\"Architectural History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/about/architectural-history|title=Architectural History - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|accessdate=March 4, 2012|date=2010-10-11}}</ref><ref name=bostonaia>{{cite bostonaia|pages=345\u201347}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u2013present===\nIn the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the [[financial endowment|endowment]], and operating expenses, the museum managed to receive over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=Boston Museum Grows by Casting a Wide Net|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11BOSTON.html|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 November 2010}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis|global financial crisis]] between 2007 and 2012, the museum's annual budget was trimmed by $1.5 million. The museum increased revenues by organizing traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, [[Moody's Investors Service]] calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum's finances would become stable in the near future.\n\nIn 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at [[Sotheby's]], bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for ''[[Man at His Bath]]'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]] at a cost reported to be more than $15 million.<ref>Judith H.

In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The new wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard (a bright, cavernous interior space) were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm [[Foster and Partners]], under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and [[Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc.|CBT/Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects]]. The landscape architecture firm [[Kathryn Gustafson#Gustafson Guthrie Nichol|Gustafson Guthrie Nichol]] redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards.\n\nThe wing opened on November 20, 2010 with free admission to the public. Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] declared it \"Museum of Fine Arts Day\", and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The {{convert|12,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} glass-enclosed courtyard now features a {{convert|42.5|ft|adj=on}} high glass sculpture, titled the ''[[Lime Green Icicle Tower]]'', by [[Dale Chihuly]].<ref name=lime>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/lime-green-icicle-tower-551953 |title=Lime Green Icicle Tower |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}</ref> In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by the award of the [[Harleston Parker Medal]], by the [[Boston Society of Architects]].\n\nIn 2015, the museum renovated its outdoors [[Japanese garden]], Tenshin-en.

Museum trustees hired architect [[Guy Lowell]] to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell's [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] design was completed. It featured a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} [[fa\u00e7ade]] of [[granite]] and a grand [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. The museum moved to its new location later in 1909.\n\nThe second phase of construction built a wing along [[The Fens (Boston, Massachusetts)|The Fens]] to house paintings galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy [[business magnate]] Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist [[John Singer Sargent]] painted the [[fresco]]es that adorn the rotunda and the associated [[colonnades]].\n\nThe Decorative Arts Wing was built in 1928, and expanded in 1968.  An addition designed by [[Hugh Stubbins]] and Associates was built in 1966\u20131970, and another expansion by [[The Architects Collaborative]] opened in 1976.  The West Wing, now the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, was designed by [[I. M. Pei]] and opened in 1981. This wing now houses the museum's cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces. \n\n[[File:Japanese gate and garden at Boston Museum of Fine Arts - August 15, 2015.jpg|right|thumb|''Tenshin-en'', the museum's Japanese garden]]\nThe Tenshin-En Japanese Garden designed by Kinsaku Nakane opened in 1988, and the Norma Jean Calderwood Garden Court and Terrace opened in 1997.<ref name=\"Architectural History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/about/architectural-history|title=Architectural History - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|accessdate=March 4, 2012|date=2010-10-11}}</ref><ref name=bostonaia>{{cite bostonaia|pages=345\u201347}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u2013present===\nIn the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the [[financial endowment|endowment]], and operating expenses, the museum managed to receive over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=Boston Museum Grows by Casting a Wide Net|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11BOSTON.html|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 November 2010}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis|global financial crisis]] between 2007 and 2012, the museum's annual budget was trimmed by $1.5 million. The museum increased revenues by organizing traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, [[Moody's Investors Service]] calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum's finances would become stable in the near future.\n\nIn 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at [[Sotheby's]], bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for ''[[Man at His Bath]]'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]] at a cost reported to be more than $15 million.<ref>Judith H.

In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The new wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard (a bright, cavernous interior space) were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm [[Foster and Partners]], under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and [[Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc.|CBT/Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects]]. The landscape architecture firm [[Kathryn Gustafson#Gustafson Guthrie Nichol|Gustafson Guthrie Nichol]] redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards.\n\nThe wing opened on November 20, 2010 with free admission to the public. Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] declared it \"Museum of Fine Arts Day\", and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The {{convert|12,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} glass-enclosed courtyard now features a {{convert|42.5|ft|adj=on}} high glass sculpture, titled the ''[[Lime Green Icicle Tower]]'', by [[Dale Chihuly]].<ref name=lime>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/lime-green-icicle-tower-551953 |title=Lime Green Icicle Tower |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}</ref> In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by the award of the [[Harleston Parker Medal]], by the [[Boston Society of Architects]].\n\nIn 2015, the museum renovated its outdoors [[Japanese garden]], Tenshin-en.

It involves abnormal behavior during the [[sleep phase]] with [[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep. The major feature of RBD is loss of muscle [[atonia]] (i.e., the loss of [[paralysis]]) during otherwise intact REM sleep (during which paralysis is not only normal but necessary). REM sleep is the stage of sleep in which most vivid dreaming occurs. The loss of motor inhibition leads to a wide spectrum of behavioral release during sleep. This extends from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movement. These behaviors can be violent in nature and in some cases will result in injury to either the individual or their bedmates.<ref name=StLouisMay2017/><ref name=\"StLouisNov2017\">{{cite journal|vauthors=St Louis EK, Boeve BF|date=November 2017|title=REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Diagnosis, Clinical Implications, and Future Directions|journal=Mayo Clin.

In a rare case, they may only happen once a week or once a month.{{medcn|date=March 2018}} Episodes occur more towards the morning hours because that is when REM sleep is more frequent.

It involves abnormal behavior during the [[sleep phase]] with [[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep. The major feature of RBD is loss of muscle [[atonia]] (i.e., the loss of [[paralysis]]) during otherwise intact REM sleep (during which paralysis is not only normal but necessary). REM sleep is the stage of sleep in which most vivid dreaming occurs. The loss of motor inhibition leads to a wide spectrum of behavioral release during sleep. This extends from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movement. These behaviors can be violent in nature and in some cases will result in injury to either the individual or their bedmates.<ref name=StLouisMay2017/><ref name=\"StLouisNov2017\">{{cite journal|vauthors=St Louis EK, Boeve BF|date=November 2017|title=REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Diagnosis, Clinical Implications, and Future Directions|journal=Mayo Clin.

A revolt in 626\u2013620 BC had seen the loss of the empire's southern provinces to the newly formed [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|war]] against its king [[Nabopolassar]] and the [[Medes]] proved disastrous for Assyria; leading to sacks and destructions of the important cities of [[Assur]] and Nineveh in 614 BC and 612 BC respectively.\n\nAfter the loss of these cities and the death of Sinsharishkun, Ashur-uballit II rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran, where he would endure as king, bolstered by an alliance with [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], for three years. His identification as \"king of Assyria\" comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as \"crown prince\" seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy.\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|Sinsharishkun}}\nIn the beginning of the 7th century BC, Assyria was at the height of its power. The entire [[Fertile Crescent]] was under the rule of the Assyrian king and due to the flourishing of trade and culture, the era has been described as the ''[[Pax Assyriaca]]'' (a term coined to parallel the ''[[Pax Romana]]''). By the end of the same century, Assyria had fallen and disappeared from history, never to rise again.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=11}}\n\nOne of the major reasons for its fall was Assyria's failure to efficiently solve the so-called \"Babylonian problem\", the near constant rebellions in its southern provinces, especially in the ancient and prestigious city of Babylon. Although some kings had ruled successfully without revolts in Babylonia, such as [[Esarhaddon]],'''{{Sfn|Porter|1987|p=1\u20132}}''' the revolts in the region had intensified during the rule of King [[Sinsharishkun]] (reigned 627\u2013612 BC). Sinsharishkun had come to the throne in 627 BC following the death of his brother [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and was almost immediately faced a revolt by the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] in 626 BC, who successfully seized some cities in northern Babylonia, including Babylon itself and Nippur. Although Sin-shumi-lishir was defeated after only three months, his revolt weakened Assyrian control in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}}\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, another revolt sprung up in Babylonia, this one by [[Nabopolassar]], who successfully seized both Babylon and Nippur. The defeat of Sinsharishkun's attempted reconquest of these cities in October of 626 BC was the final Assyrian campaign for the city of Babylon. On 22/23 November of that year, Nabopolassar was formally crowned as [[King of Babylon]], founding the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Sinsharishkun attempted to reconquer cities in northern Babylonia in 625\u2013624 BC but was repeatedly repelled. In 622 BC, Nabopolassar seized the last Assyrian outposts in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nThe Babylonians scored repeated victories against the Assyrians and by 616 BC Babylonian troops had even reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], who saw Assyria as a useful buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east, rushed to Sinsharishkun's aid, but a joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign into Babylonia was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=16\u201317}} In 614 BC, the city of [[Assur]], once the capital and still the ideological and religious center of Assyria, was captured, plundered and sacked by the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]], allies of Nabopolassar.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The Babylonian army under Nabopolassar had been late to the battle, only arriving after the Medes had already killed many of the city's inhabitants and begun plundering it.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Two years later, the Assyrian capital itself, [[Nineveh]], fell.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The fate of King Sinsharishkun is not certain, but it is commonly accepted that he died in defense of Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}\n\nAshur-uballit's background is uncertain. It is known that he was an Assyrian general and he might have been the son of King Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Radner|2013|p=}} Ashur-uballit is likely the same person as the unnamed crown prince (designated heir) attested in inscriptions from Nineveh dated to 626 and 623 BC. Sinsharishkun's appointment of a crown prince so early in his reign (having only become king in 627 BC) was likely to avoid the succession problems which had been common in Assyria since the reign of [[Sennacherib]] (reigned 705\u2013681 BC).{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=264}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rule at Harran and status ===\nIn Assyrian tradition, the king was appointed to his position by the Assyrian national deity, [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], during the New Year festivals in Assur. The last king to be crowned at the temple of Ashur at Assur had been Sinsharishkun and with the city's destruction in 614 BC, the traditional Assyrian coronation ritual was now impossible.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} The coronation ritual in Assur saw the god Ashur invest the king with royal power, affirming his status as Ashur's earthly representative.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} Ashur-uballit did have a coronation ceremony in late 612 BC,{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} but instead of conducting it in Assur, it was conducted in the temple of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], another important deity in the empire, at [[Harran]].{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} At Harran, the Assyrian Empire continued to endure under the rule of Ashur-uballit. His identification as Sinsharishkun's successor and the king of Assyria comes from Babylonian chronicles. The Babylonians thus saw him as the Assyrian king, but the few subjects Ashur-uballit governed himself probably did not share this view. Instead, Ashur-uballit's formal title was crown prince (''mar \u0161arri'', literally meaning \"son of the king\"),{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} which can be inferred from preserved documents, such as the following portion of a legal document from the city [[Dur-Katlimmu]]:\n{{Quote| quote = Whoever contests the agreement, ''[missing portion]'' shall be his legal adversaries; the covenant of the crown prince shall seek vengeance; he shall give ten minas of silver.<br>28th day, month Tebetu, eponym year of Se\u2019-ila\u2019i. Witness is the city lord Iadi\u2019-il. Witness is Nab\u00fb-na\u1e63ir son of \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri. Witness is \u0160arru-emuranni son of Nab\u00fb-e\u1e6dir. Witness is Salmanu-re\u1e2btu-u\u1e63ur.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=137}}|author=|title=|source=}}\nThe portion of the document that is important in regards to Ashur-uballit's status is the mention of the \"covenant of the crown prince\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a mar \u0161arri''). This phrase is common in legal documents, appearing frequently since the reign of King [[Esarhaddon]] in 672 BC, but always in the form of \"covenant of the king\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a \u0161arri''), showing that the office of king was vacant and the crown prince filled that role instead.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}} Inscriptions from this time also record the name of the final Commander-in-Chief of the Assyrian army, Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur{{refn|Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur's predecessor as Commander-in-Chief, \u0160ama\u0161-sarru-ibni, had probably died with King Sinsharishkun at Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}}|group=\"n\"}}, which means \"O [[Nabu]], protect the crown prince!\". Such names were common in Assyria but usually referred to the king, not the crown prince.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}} Ashur-uballit not formally being king does not indicate that his claim to the throne was challenged, only that he had yet to go through with the traditional ceremony. The appointment of a crown prince required the formal recognition of all subjects and of the gods. Should the king be unable to exercise his duties, the crown prince was a competent substitute, exercising similar legal and political power. Ashur-uballit was the recognized legitimate ruler, and his title was only a provisional arrangement until he could undergo the proper coronation.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe choice of ''A\u0161\u0161ur-uballi\u1e6d'' as a regnal name was probably a highly conscious one. The meaning of the name, \"Ashur has kept alive\", suggests that Assyria's chief deity and its empire would be ultimately successful in their battle against their enemies.

A revolt in 626\u2013620 BC had seen the loss of the empire's southern provinces to the newly formed [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|war]] against its king [[Nabopolassar]] and the [[Medes]] proved disastrous for Assyria; leading to sacks and destructions of the important cities of [[Assur]] and Nineveh in 614 BC and 612 BC respectively.\n\nAfter the loss of these cities and the death of Sinsharishkun, Ashur-uballit II rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran, where he would endure as king, bolstered by an alliance with [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], for three years. His identification as \"king of Assyria\" comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as \"crown prince\" seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy.\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|Sinsharishkun}}\nIn the beginning of the 7th century BC, Assyria was at the height of its power. The entire [[Fertile Crescent]] was under the rule of the Assyrian king and due to the flourishing of trade and culture, the era has been described as the ''[[Pax Assyriaca]]'' (a term coined to parallel the ''[[Pax Romana]]''). By the end of the same century, Assyria had fallen and disappeared from history, never to rise again.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=11}}\n\nOne of the major reasons for its fall was Assyria's failure to efficiently solve the so-called \"Babylonian problem\", the near constant rebellions in its southern provinces, especially in the ancient and prestigious city of Babylon. Although some kings had ruled successfully without revolts in Babylonia, such as [[Esarhaddon]],'''{{Sfn|Porter|1987|p=1\u20132}}''' the revolts in the region had intensified during the rule of King [[Sinsharishkun]] (reigned 627\u2013612 BC). Sinsharishkun had come to the throne in 627 BC following the death of his brother [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and was almost immediately faced a revolt by the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] in 626 BC, who successfully seized some cities in northern Babylonia, including Babylon itself and Nippur. Although Sin-shumi-lishir was defeated after only three months, his revolt weakened Assyrian control in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}}\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, another revolt sprung up in Babylonia, this one by [[Nabopolassar]], who successfully seized both Babylon and Nippur. The defeat of Sinsharishkun's attempted reconquest of these cities in October of 626 BC was the final Assyrian campaign for the city of Babylon. On 22/23 November of that year, Nabopolassar was formally crowned as [[King of Babylon]], founding the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Sinsharishkun attempted to reconquer cities in northern Babylonia in 625\u2013624 BC but was repeatedly repelled. In 622 BC, Nabopolassar seized the last Assyrian outposts in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nThe Babylonians scored repeated victories against the Assyrians and by 616 BC Babylonian troops had even reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], who saw Assyria as a useful buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east, rushed to Sinsharishkun's aid, but a joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign into Babylonia was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=16\u201317}} In 614 BC, the city of [[Assur]], once the capital and still the ideological and religious center of Assyria, was captured, plundered and sacked by the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]], allies of Nabopolassar.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The Babylonian army under Nabopolassar had been late to the battle, only arriving after the Medes had already killed many of the city's inhabitants and begun plundering it.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Two years later, the Assyrian capital itself, [[Nineveh]], fell.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The fate of King Sinsharishkun is not certain, but it is commonly accepted that he died in defense of Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}\n\nAshur-uballit's background is uncertain. It is known that he was an Assyrian general and he might have been the son of King Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Radner|2013|p=}} Ashur-uballit is likely the same person as the unnamed crown prince (designated heir) attested in inscriptions from Nineveh dated to 626 and 623 BC. Sinsharishkun's appointment of a crown prince so early in his reign (having only become king in 627 BC) was likely to avoid the succession problems which had been common in Assyria since the reign of [[Sennacherib]] (reigned 705\u2013681 BC).{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=264}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rule at Harran and status ===\nIn Assyrian tradition, the king was appointed to his position by the Assyrian national deity, [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], during the New Year festivals in Assur. The last king to be crowned at the temple of Ashur at Assur had been Sinsharishkun and with the city's destruction in 614 BC, the traditional Assyrian coronation ritual was now impossible.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} The coronation ritual in Assur saw the god Ashur invest the king with royal power, affirming his status as Ashur's earthly representative.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} Ashur-uballit did have a coronation ceremony in late 612 BC,{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} but instead of conducting it in Assur, it was conducted in the temple of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], another important deity in the empire, at [[Harran]].{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} At Harran, the Assyrian Empire continued to endure under the rule of Ashur-uballit. His identification as Sinsharishkun's successor and the king of Assyria comes from Babylonian chronicles. The Babylonians thus saw him as the Assyrian king, but the few subjects Ashur-uballit governed himself probably did not share this view. Instead, Ashur-uballit's formal title was crown prince (''mar \u0161arri'', literally meaning \"son of the king\"),{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} which can be inferred from preserved documents, such as the following portion of a legal document from the city [[Dur-Katlimmu]]:\n{{Quote| quote = Whoever contests the agreement, ''[missing portion]'' shall be his legal adversaries; the covenant of the crown prince shall seek vengeance; he shall give ten minas of silver.<br>28th day, month Tebetu, eponym year of Se\u2019-ila\u2019i. Witness is the city lord Iadi\u2019-il. Witness is Nab\u00fb-na\u1e63ir son of \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri. Witness is \u0160arru-emuranni son of Nab\u00fb-e\u1e6dir. Witness is Salmanu-re\u1e2btu-u\u1e63ur.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=137}}|author=|title=|source=}}\nThe portion of the document that is important in regards to Ashur-uballit's status is the mention of the \"covenant of the crown prince\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a mar \u0161arri''). This phrase is common in legal documents, appearing frequently since the reign of King [[Esarhaddon]] in 672 BC, but always in the form of \"covenant of the king\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a \u0161arri''), showing that the office of king was vacant and the crown prince filled that role instead.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}} Inscriptions from this time also record the name of the final Commander-in-Chief of the Assyrian army, Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur{{refn|Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur's predecessor as Commander-in-Chief, \u0160ama\u0161-sarru-ibni, had probably died with King Sinsharishkun at Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}}|group=\"n\"}}, which means \"O [[Nabu]], protect the crown prince!\". Such names were common in Assyria but usually referred to the king, not the crown prince.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}} Ashur-uballit not formally being king does not indicate that his claim to the throne was challenged, only that he had yet to go through with the traditional ceremony. The appointment of a crown prince required the formal recognition of all subjects and of the gods. Should the king be unable to exercise his duties, the crown prince was a competent substitute, exercising similar legal and political power. Ashur-uballit was the recognized legitimate ruler, and his title was only a provisional arrangement until he could undergo the proper coronation.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe choice of ''A\u0161\u0161ur-uballi\u1e6d'' as a regnal name was probably a highly conscious one. The meaning of the name, \"Ashur has kept alive\", suggests that Assyria's chief deity and its empire would be ultimately successful in their battle against their enemies. It also connects him to the earlier Assyrian king of the same name, [[Ashur-uballit I]] of the 14th century BC. Ashur-uballit I had been the first Assyrian ruler to abandon the old religious title of ''i\u0161\u0161i\u2019ak'' (\"governor\") in favor of the title ''\u0161arrum'' (\"king\"), signifying his role as an absolute monarch.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=136}}\n\nIn Assyria, each year was assigned an eponym name. The name used for the year noted in the Dur-Katlimmu legal document, \"Se\u2019-ila\u2019i\", only appears in this source and demonstrates that it is from after the Assyrian heartlands had fallen to invaders, when eponym names, in the absence of central authority, became local and often confined to single cities. The \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri, whose son is mentioned, also appears in inscriptions dating to the reign of Ashurbanipal a little over a decade prior. Although the document uses traditional Assyrian titles such as Companion (''\u0161a qurb\u016bte'', literally meaning \"he who is close to the king\") and cohort commander (''rab ki\u1e63ri''), suggesting that they still carried their traditional importance, the document also calls the local leader Iadi\u2019-il by the title of city lord (Akkadian: ''b\u0113l \u0101li'') a title formerly only associated with members of the Assyrian ruling dynasty. A non-dynastic appointed official for the government of a city was usually titled as ''\u1e2bazannu'' (usually translated as \"mayor\") or ''\u0161a mu\u1e2b\u1e2bi \u0101li'' (meaning \"city oversser\") and the use of the title ''b\u0113l \u0101li'' indicates that parts of the Assyrian administrative framework were no longer functioning.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n=== Fall of Harran and attempted recapture ===\n{{Main|Fall of Harran|Siege of Harran}}\nAt the time Ashur-uballit became the ruler of Assyria in 612 BC, his main objective would have been to retake the Assyrian heartland, including Assur and Nineveh.

Throughout the next century, Egypt and Babylon, brought into direct contact with each other through Assyria's fall, would frequently war with each other over control in the Fertile Crescent.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Sargonid dynasty]]\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=Bassir|first=Hussein|date=2018|title=The Egyptian expansion in the near east in the saite period|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52c/14c7ebc70abf1c2053fa944135cb51d6cd87.pdf|journal=Journal of Historical Archaeology & Anthropological Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013200|ref=CITEREFBassir2018|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=B5BHDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=%22Ashuruballit%22&source=bl&ots=4cZW2uzHO-&sig=ACfU3U0WHi6J0_VqLVHKeADYVh52CAfjww&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje6KC62b_nAhUJt4sKHRvND8oQ6AEwBXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Ashuruballit%22&f=false|title=The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia: Volume I|last=Kia|first=Mehrdad|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2016|isbn=978-1440845680|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFKia2016}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&f=true|title=The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule|last=Lipschits|first=Oled|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2005|isbn=978-1575060958|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLipschits2005}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8714110/|title=Symbols of Power: Figurative Aspects of Esarhaddon's Babylonian Policy (681-669 BC)|last=Porter|first=Barbara N.|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=1987|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFPorter1987}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Radner|first=Karen|date=2019|title=Last Emperor or Crown Prince Forever?
