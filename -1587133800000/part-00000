He played for the Athletic Club in the [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] competition.

The North Island were thrashed 46 to 5 with Loveridge playing in the three-quarters <ref>{{cite news\n| title = England (46) North Island (5)/A Crushing Defeat\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Hastings Standard, Volume X, Issue 198\n| date = 1920-08-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/HAST19200805.2.3.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-16}}</ref>. Then on August 7 just 3 days later Loveridge travelled down to Christchurch to make his test debut for New Zealand. The match was played at Lancaster Park with 6,000 spectators present.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The writer for the ''Star'' said that \u201cLoveridge nearly had the team in difficulties through holding on too long. By a stroke of good luck however he was able to relieve the position by marking just in front of the posts\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = England Wins, Nineteen Points to Three/Mud Scramble on Lancaster Park\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Star, Issue 20019\n| date = 1920-08-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TS19200807.2.72\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>. Loveridge stopped playing for Marist at the end of this season and does not appear to have played again. In 1927 he was reinstated back into rugby but it is unlikely that he pulled on the boots again officially due to work commitments and he was aged 35 by this point <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Teams for Tomorrow\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIII, Issue 189\n| date = 1922-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220811.2.114\n| accessdate = 2020-04-16}}</ref>.\n\n==Personal life and death==\n===Marriage and children===\nNorm Loverage married Myrtle Francis Manley on March 25, 1913 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = In Divorce/Undefended Cases/Desertion the Main Ground\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Evening Post, Volume CVIII, Issue 101\n| date = 1924-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19241029.2.82\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>, they had a son, Darrell William Loveridge in 1913, and another son Raymond Louvain Loveridge in 1915. Raymond died at just 3 weeks of age. They had a daughter in 1919 named Veronica Myrtle Elizabeth Loveridge. \n\nIn 1918 Loveridge was required to serve in the military but he appealed on the grounds of \u201cundue hardship (family reasons)\u201d with the case adjourned until the next sitting of the Wellington Military Service Board <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Military Service/Sitting of Board/Further Appeals\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Evening Post, Volume XCVI, Issue 33\n| date = 1918-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19180807.2.47\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.

He played for the Athletic Club in the Wellington competition.

Then on August 7 just 3 days later Loveridge travelled down to Christchurch to make his test debut for New Zealand. The match was played at Lancaster Park with 6,000 spectators present.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The writer for the ''Star'' said that \u201cLoveridge nearly had the team in difficulties through holding on too long.

The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>. Loveridge stopped playing for Marist at the end of this season and does not appear to have played again. In 1927 he was reinstated back into rugby but it is unlikely that he pulled on the boots again officially due to work commitments and he was aged 35 by this point <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Teams for Tomorrow\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIII, Issue 189\n| date = 1922-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220811.2.114\n| accessdate = 2020-04-16}}</ref>.\n\n==Personal life and death==\n===Marriage and children===\nNorm Loverage married Myrtle Francis Manley on March 25, 1913 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = In Divorce/Undefended Cases/Desertion the Main Ground\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Evening Post, Volume CVIII, Issue 101\n| date = 1924-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19241029.2.82\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>, they had a son, Darrell William Loveridge in 1913, and another son Raymond Louvain Loveridge in 1915.

The driver loaded the excavator backwards and neglected to tuck the boom so the maximum height was actually 17 feet, 9 inches above the roadway. The pedestrian bridge, which had just been inspected in the month prior to the accident and found to be structurally sound, had a vertical clearance of 16 feet.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them.

These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters.

These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.
