Only tickets sold for [[National Rail]] services are included. As such, London Underground, special tours, local [[light rail]] and [[heritage railway]] tickets are excluded. Note that the data covers mainland Great Britain and surrounding small islands (such as the [[Isle of Wight]]), not the [[United Kingdom]], and so exclude tickets within [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Eurostar]].

Wing also sought to create a program for [[fifth grade]] students in Alabama and elsewhere to attend Space Camp at no cost to them.  Anonymous corporate pledges that Wing promised would fund the $800 per student never arrived. Wing prolonged the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission's investigation into the pledges by writing bogus personal checks and having the center record them as received.  The program ultimately cost the center $7.5 million.

Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]], in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.\n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive.\n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. The family moved to [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Colorado]], in July 1993.<ref name=\"Suspects\" />\n\nThe Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Eric's older brother, Kevin, attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].<ref name=\"sides\">{{cite news |author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |access-date=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201910/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC |date=December 6, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHarris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status.\n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be \"god-like\". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word \"WRATH\" printed in red.<ref name=USAToday/> It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He furthermore wrote that what fun is life without death. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place.

Harris and Klebold reportedly discussed their motives for the attacks in these videos and gave instructions in bomb making.

Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the Neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the 'jocks' who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia.<ref name=\"No easy answers\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1 | title=No easy answers: The truth behind death at Columbine | publisher=Lantern Books | author1=Brown, Brooks | author2=Merritt, Rob | year=2002 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1/page/n67 68]\u201370 | isbn=1590560310 | access-date=September 23, 2016 }}</ref> The trench coat inadvertently became the members' uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as an inexpensive present.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nInvestigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre.

According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.<ref name = \"slate\"/>\n\nAccording to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of [[schizotypal personality disorder]] \u2013 he struck many people as odd, was very shy, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal, considered notable due to Klebold's peers that often described him as very intelligent. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as \"god-like\" and wrote about he was \"made a human without the possibility of BEING human.\" He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and plenty of friends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Langman | first = Peter | title = Rampage School Shooters: A Typology | orig-year = 2010 | year = 2016 | edition =  | chapter =  | chapter-url =  | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url = https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190712111604/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-date = July 12, 2019 | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =  | access-date = July 12, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Reaction of Sue Klebold===\n{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}\n\n[[Sue Klebold]], mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things.

Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.\n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive.\n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. The family moved to [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Colorado]], in July 1993.<ref name=\"Suspects\" />\n\nThe Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Eric's older brother, Kevin, attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].<ref name=\"sides\">{{cite news |author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |access-date=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201910/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC |date=December 6, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHarris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status.\n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

In violation of federal law, Russell failed to keep [[Federal Form 4473|records]] of the sale, yet he determined that the purchaser of the gun was twenty-one years of age or older.

The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs. The two boys purchased six more propane tanks on the morning of the attack.\n\nMore complex bombs, such as the one that detonated on the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue, had [[time bomb|timers]]. The two largest bombs built were found in the school cafeteria and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating. It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed in the cafeteria had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.<ref>{{cite web |title=At 'perfect' school, student sat next to bomb |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_1076860,00.html |date=April 12, 2002 |work=Rocky Mountain News |first=Lynn |last=Bartels |access-date=August 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420145325/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_1076860%2C00.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{Main|Columbine High School massacre}}\n\n===Day of the massacre===\n[[File:Columbine Shooting Security Camera.jpg|thumbnail|Harris (left) and Klebold (right) on a surveillance camera on the day of the shooting]]\nOn April 20, 1999, just weeks before Harris and Klebold were both due to graduate,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/us/terror-in-littleton-the-seniors-in-horrific-circumstance-sense-of-lost-pomp.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208020853/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/us/terror-in-littleton-the-seniors-in-horrific-circumstance-sense-of-lost-pomp.html |archive-date=December 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Brooks Brown, who was smoking a cigarette outside during lunch break, saw Harris arrive at school.

Adapted from [[Ethel Lina White]]'s British novel ''Some Must Watch'' (1933) by screenwriter [[Mel Dinelli]], the film follows a [[muteness|mute]] young woman in an early-20th century [[Vermont]] town being terrorized by a serial killer who targets disabled women. The novel was adapted for a radio production starring [[Helen Hayes]] before reaching the screen.\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on February 6, 1946. For her performance in the film, Barrymore received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The-Spiral-Staircase.jpg|right|upright=1|thumb|Dorothy McGuire in ''The Spiral Staircase'']]\nIn a small village in 1906 [[Vermont]],<ref name=beatrice/> the [[muteness|mute]] Helen attends a [[silent film]] screening in the parlor of a local inn. During the screening, a crippled woman staying at the inn is murdered in her room by a man hiding in the closet; her murder is the third in a string of [[serial killer|serial killing]]s in the community. Dr. Parry, a friend of Helen's, drives her to the Warren home, a large estate outside town where Helen is employed as a live-in companion for the bedridden Mrs. Warren. Also residing in the house are Mrs. Warren's stepson Albert, a local professor; her son, Steven; and a live-in staff: Mrs. Oates, a housekeeper; her husband Mr. Oates, a handyman; Blanche, a secretary who is having an affair with Steven; and Nurse Barker, Mrs. Warren's verbally-abused nurse. \n\nAt the house, a cloaked figure watches from the woods as Helen ascends the driveway. Inside, Helen finds Mrs. Oates in the kitchen; she discusses the murder, and expresses fear for Helen, as the killer appears to be targeting \"defenseless\" women. While walking up the staircase, Helen pauses in front of a mirror to examine herself, and while doing so, the eye of an unknown person watches her from the shadows. In the midst of a rainstorm, the constable stops by and warns Albert to keep watch over Helen. After Mrs. Warren loses consciousness, Dr. Parry is summoned to the home. Nurse Barker discovers a bottle of [[diethyl ether|ether]] has gone missing, and sends Mr. Oates to retrieve some in town. Meanwhile, Mrs. Warren regains consciousness, and urges Dr. Parry to take Helen with him. He offers to bring Helen to [[Boston]] and help her work through the trauma of her parents' death, which triggered her muteness. She agrees to go, and Dr. Parry makes plans to return later in the evening after completing another house call.\n\nAfter an argument with Steven, Blanche asks Helen if she can leave with her that night. Helen agrees, and Blanche goes to the basement to retrieve her suitcase, where she is attacked and murdered. Helen later finds her corpse in the basement, and is confronted by Steven. Frightened that he is responsible, she locks him in a closet and flees upstairs. She attempts to wake Mrs. Oates, but she has passed out, drunk on [[brandy]]. Helen attempts to call Dr. Parry, but is unable to speak to the telephone operator.\n\nAlbert finds Helen frantic, and she writes on a notepad that Blanche has been murdered. As he follows Helen up the staircase to Mrs. Warren's room, Albert confesses to killing Blanche out of jealousy. He then reveals himself as the serial murderer, professing his goal of killing the \"weak and imperfect of the world.\" Helen flees in terror, locking herself in Mrs. Warren's bedroom, where she finds Mrs. Warren unconscious. Meanwhile, the constable returns to the house, and is answered at the front door by Albert; he leaves a message for Helen letting her know that Dr. Parry is unable to return that night, and that they will have to go to Boston the following day. As the constable leaves, Helen attempts to get his attention by smashing the bedroom window, but he is unable to hear it amidst the wind and thunder. Helen returns to the basement to free Steven, but finds Albert waiting in hiding. He chases her as she ascends the staircase to the second floor, but the two are met by Mrs. Warren, armed with a gun. Mrs. Warren shoots Albert multiple times in the chest, killing him, and in the midst of the gunfire, Helen screams in horror.\n \nMrs. Warren orders Helen to retrieve Steven, and she frees him from the basement closet. Mrs. Warren embraces Steven, and dies on the staircase in his arms. Downstairs, Helen emotionally calls Dr. Parry on the telephone\u2014she is now able to fully speak.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Helen\n* [[George Brent]] as Professor Albert Warren\n* [[Ethel Barrymore]] as Mrs. Warren\n* [[Kent Smith]] as Dr. Parry\n* [[Gordon Oliver]] as Steven Warren\n* [[Rhonda Fleming]] as Blanche\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Mrs. Oates\n* [[Sara Allgood]] as Nurse Barker\n* [[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]] as Mr. Oates\n* [[James Bell (actor)|James Bell]] as Constable\n* [[Erville Alderson]] as Dr. Harvey (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Siodmak]] as The Killer's 'Eye' (uncredited)\n\n==Analysis==\nSince its release, ''The Spiral Staircase'' has been subject to significant [[film criticism]] and academic discussion, particularly in regard to the film's visual motifs and blending of [[horror film|horror]] and [[film noir]].{{sfn|Golden|2015|pages=90\u20133}} Although characterized by contemporaneous press as a \"mystery romance,\"<ref name=detroit>{{cite news|work=Detroit Free Press|location=Detroit, Michigan|title=PARTNERS IN FEAR|p=12|date=February 5, 1946|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99201306/}}</ref> the film has been noted by contemporary critics for its prominent Gothic horror elements.{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=89}} It has also been cited as one of numerous progenitors to the [[slasher film]],<ref>{{cite web|work=[[NJ.com]]|title=From monstrous metaphor to brainless splatter, the slasher film devolves|author=Whitty, Stephen|date=March 8, 2009|accessdate=December 22, 2017|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/03/from_monstrous_metaphor_to_bra.html}}</ref> specifically for its female-centric cast{{sfn|Olney|2015|p=61}} and [[point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] cinematography deployed during scenes in which the killer stalks his victims.{{sfn|Hutchings|2017|p=300}}\n\nFilm scholar Amy Golden notes several significant visual allusions in the film, such as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929) and [[Maya Deren]]'s ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943).{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=90}} Golden cites the film as a \"quintessential example of 1940s horror.\"{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=90}} Writer Denis Grunes in 2007 suggested the film is \"in fact a masked allegory of the passage of [[silent film|silent cinema]] into sound,\" citing the mute protagonist's predicament as evidence.{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=92}} This notion was also suggested by film scholar Amy Lawrence in her 1991 book ''Echo and Narcissus: Women's Voices in Classical Hollywood Cinema''.{{sfn|Lawrence|1991|p=6}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nAdapted from the [[Ethel Lina White]] novel ''Some Must Watch'' (1933), ''The Spiral Staircase'' was screenwriter [[Mel Dinelli]]'s first screenplay.<ref name=trivia/> RKO Pictures had acquired the rights to produce the film from independent producer [[David O.

Siodmak]] and starring [[Dorothy McGuire]], [[George Brent]], and [[Ethel Barrymore]]. Adapted from [[Ethel Lina White]]'s British novel ''Some Must Watch'' (1933) by screenwriter [[Mel Dinelli]], the film follows a [[muteness|mute]] young woman in an early-20th century [[Vermont]] town being terrorized by a serial killer who targets disabled women. The novel was adapted for a radio production starring [[Helen Hayes]] before reaching the screen.\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on February 6, 1946. For her performance in the film, Barrymore received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The-Spiral-Staircase.jpg|right|upright=1|thumb|Dorothy McGuire in ''The Spiral Staircase'']]\nIn a small village in 1906 [[Vermont]],<ref name=beatrice/> the [[muteness|mute]] Helen attends a [[silent film]] screening in the parlor of a local inn. During the screening, a crippled woman staying at the inn is murdered in her room by a man hiding in the closet; her murder is the third in a string of [[serial killer|serial killing]]s in the community. Dr. Parry, a friend of Helen's, drives her to the Warren home, a large estate outside town where Helen is employed as a live-in companion for the bedridden Mrs. Warren. Also residing in the house are Mrs. Warren's stepson Albert, a local professor; her son, Steven; and a live-in staff: Mrs. Oates, a housekeeper; her husband Mr. Oates, a handyman; Blanche, a secretary who is having an affair with Steven; and Nurse Barker, Mrs. Warren's verbally-abused nurse. \n\nAt the house, a cloaked figure watches from the woods as Helen ascends the driveway. Inside, Helen finds Mrs. Oates in the kitchen; she discusses the murder, and expresses fear for Helen, as the killer appears to be targeting \"defenseless\" women. While walking up the staircase, Helen pauses in front of a mirror to examine herself, and while doing so, the eye of an unknown person watches her from the shadows. In the midst of a rainstorm, the constable stops by and warns Albert to keep watch over Helen. After Mrs. Warren loses consciousness, Dr. Parry is summoned to the home. Nurse Barker discovers a bottle of [[diethyl ether|ether]] has gone missing, and sends Mr. Oates to retrieve some in town. Meanwhile, Mrs. Warren regains consciousness, and urges Dr. Parry to take Helen with him. He offers to bring Helen to [[Boston]] and help her work through the trauma of her parents' death, which triggered her muteness. She agrees to go, and Dr. Parry makes plans to return later in the evening after completing another house call.\n\nAfter an argument with Steven, Blanche asks Helen if she can leave with her that night. Helen agrees, and Blanche goes to the basement to retrieve her suitcase, where she is attacked and murdered. Helen later finds her corpse in the basement, and is confronted by Steven. Frightened that he is responsible, she locks him in a closet and flees upstairs. She attempts to wake Mrs. Oates, but she has passed out, drunk on [[brandy]]. Helen attempts to call Dr. Parry, but is unable to speak to the telephone operator.\n\nAlbert finds Helen frantic, and she writes on a notepad that Blanche has been murdered. As he follows Helen up the staircase to Mrs. Warren's room, Albert confesses to killing Blanche out of jealousy. He then reveals himself as the serial murderer, professing his goal of killing the \"weak and imperfect of the world.\" Helen flees in terror, locking herself in Mrs. Warren's bedroom, where she finds Mrs. Warren unconscious. Meanwhile, the constable returns to the house, and is answered at the front door by Albert; he leaves a message for Helen letting her know that Dr. Parry is unable to return that night, and that they will have to go to Boston the following day. As the constable leaves, Helen attempts to get his attention by smashing the bedroom window, but he is unable to hear it amidst the wind and thunder. Helen returns to the basement to free Steven, but finds Albert waiting in hiding. He chases her as she ascends the staircase to the second floor, but the two are met by Mrs. Warren, armed with a gun. Mrs. Warren shoots Albert multiple times in the chest, killing him, and in the midst of the gunfire, Helen screams in horror.\n \nMrs. Warren orders Helen to retrieve Steven, and she frees him from the basement closet.
