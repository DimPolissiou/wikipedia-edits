He listed the requirements on a sheet of paper. Wahlforss called the Hietalahti shipyard manager Eric Holmstr\u00f6m and the company's icebreaker specialist Ernst B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m to a meeting asking: \"Are we able to construct such a ship?\" B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m answered directly: \"Yes, we are.\" Subsequently, B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m made a 1:500-scaled sketch of the new 22,000-hp icebreaker in relation to Kapitan-class. Wahlforss took the drawing with him in 1954 to a meeting in Moscow where he had dinner with Mikoyan. When Mikoyan opened the discussion about the new icebreaker concept, Wahlforss took the drawing from his suitcase asking \"Is this what you need?\". Mikoyan became very delighted and said: \"For three years I have asked from our own shipyards for possibility to construct such a icebreaker, but I have only got headshaking!\"<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\">{{cite book |last=Zilliacus |first=Benedict |year=1984 |chapter= \u00bbSeitsem\u00e4ntoista sanaa\u00bb |title=Wilhelm Wahlforss |language=Finnish |others=Translated from Swedish by Riitta Valaj\u00e4rvi |location=Porvoo |publisher=Oy W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Ab |pages=283\u2013295 |isbn=951-99541-8-X }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 1956, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 and [[Sudoimport]], the Soviet foreign trade organization with a monopoly for the foreign trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract for the construction of two polar icebreakers. While only half as powerful as the 44,000{{nbsp}}hp ''Lenin'', the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time.<ref name=\"wartsila\"/> The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's engineering expertise to a tough test. At the end, however, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 could deliver what Wahlforss had promised. Few years later, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 received a follow-up order for three more icebreakers of the same design.<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\"/>\n\nThe hull of the icebreaker was assembled on a [[slipway]] and launched on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the entrance channel had to be [[dredging|dredged]]. In addition, a special steel pontoon had to be constructed and welded to the stern of the icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> In the [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching ceremony]], the new icebreaker was given the name ''Moskva'' after [[Moscow|the capital city]]. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and ''Moskva'' was delivered during the summer of 1960.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n== Service history ==\n\nIn October 1961, after assisting more than a hundred cargo ships in the Russian Arctic during the autumn navigating season, ''Moskva'' completed an eastbound transit of the Northern Sea Route from [[Murmansk]] to [[Vladivostok]] in only 10 days. This was both a record time as well as the latest time a successful transit had been completed before the winter, and demonstrated how the shipping season could be extended with modern icebreakers.<ref name=\"polarpost\" /> Afterwards, ''Moskva'' was stationed in [[Vladivostok]] and used to escort in the eastern part of the Northern Sea Route.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" />\n\nOn 20 October 1965, ''Moskva'' and her sister ship [[Leningrad (icebreaker)|''Leningrad'']] came to assist ''Vitimles'', a merchant ship that had been waiting for icebreaker assistance for 30 days in the [[East Siberian Sea]].<ref name=\"marchenko\">{{cite book |last=Marchenko |first=Nataliya |year=2012 |title=Russian Arctic Seas |url= |location= |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-22124-8 |accessdate= }}</ref> However, by the time the icebreakers arrived, the pack ice had begun to drift at a considerable speed and a dangerous phenomenon known as \"ice jet\" appeared,<ref>Weintrit, A. and Neumann, T.

At the widest point of the hull, the vessel had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.50|m|ft|0}}, but due to the sloping sides the maximum beam at waterline was slightly less, {{convert|23.50|m|ft|0}}. At design waterline, the icebreaker drew {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} of water and had a displacement of 13,290 tonnes. However, the maximum draught of the vessel was {{convert|10.5|m|ft|0}}, corresponding to a maximum displacement of 15,360 tonnes. ''Moskva'' was the largest non-nuclear icebreaker in the world at the time of the delivery,<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> having almost twice the displacement of the largest western icebreakers.\n\nDesigned to withstand the compression of the polar pack ice, the fully welded steel hull of ''Moskva'' was very strong. The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide ice belt, where the hull plating was over {{convert|50|mm|in}} thick in the bow, was designed to withstand ice pressures of up to 1,000 tonnes per square meter (about {{convert|9.81|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on|disp=out}}), more than 30 to 60 times as much as normal merchant ships at the time. In bow and stern, the web frames were aligned perpendicularly to the shell plating. Longitudinally, the hull was divided into nine watertight compartments and the vessel had a full-length double hull below tweendeck.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n''Moskva'' had single and double cabins for 109 persons. In addition to vessel crew and aviation detachment, accommodation and laboratories were reserved for scientists when the icebreaker carried out research expeditions in the polar waters. Special attention had been paid to the furnishing and decoration of the public spaces, which included a game room and a music room with a piano for the officers. The icebreaker was delivered from the shipyard with a total of three television sets.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nDesigned to escort merchant ships through ice-covered waters, ''Moskva'' had a towing winch and a notch in the stern where the bow of the towed ship would be pulled. For ice reconnaissance, the icebreaker had a helicopter hangar and a landing platform in the stern. The vessel had two motor lifeboats for 60 persons and two 70-person lifeboats with manually operated propeller. In addition, the icebreaker carried a {{convert|11.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} motor [[launch (boat)|launch]] with a steel hull, a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} aluminum boat, two fiberglass ice sledge-boats, a {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} rowing boat and a light aluminum dinghy. The boats were launched using the icebreakers' two 10-ton deck cranes.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\n''Moskva'' was a diesel-electric icebreaker with a power plant consisting of eight [[straight-nine engine|9-cylinder]] W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 9MH51 single-acting [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engines]], each of which was rated at 3,250{{nbsp}}hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to [[Siemens]] [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive system]]. Normally, four generators were connected to the tandem electric motor driving the centerline propeller shaft and two generators to the propulsion motors driving the wing shafts, but the system allowed connecting two generators from the center circuit to either port or starboard circuit and vice versa in case of engine failure.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nThe electric power produced by the main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500{{nbsp}}hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500{{nbsp}}hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nWith an overall propulsion power of 22,000{{nbsp}}hp, ''Moskva'' was at the time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered ''Lenin'' which, at 44,000{{nbsp}}hp, had twice the power of the ''Moskva''-class icebreakers.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built [[USS Glacier (AGB-4)|USS ''Glacier'']], had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500{{nbsp}}hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as ''Moskva'', the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four hours at a time and the total continuous rating was only 16,900{{nbsp}}hp.<ref>[http://www.mxak.org/community/icepick/icepick5.pdf The Icebreaker USS/USCGC Glacier]. {{retrieved|accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{commonscat|IMO 5242495|''Moskva''}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1959 ships]]\n[[Category:Icebreakers of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Helsinki]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the Soviet Union]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin \n|infobox caption=\n|display title=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[File:Icebreaker Moskva (1959) under construction 2.jpg|300px|''Moskva'' under construction at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Hietalahti shipyard]]\n|Ship caption=''Moskva'' under construction at [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]]\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=[[Soviet Union]]\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|Soviet Union|naval}}\n|Ship name=''Moskva'' (''\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430'')\n|Ship namesake=[[Moscow]]\n|Ship owner=\n|Ship registry=[[Vladivostok]], [[Russia]]\n|Ship ordered=24 May 1956\n|Ship builder=[[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]], [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]\n|Ship original cost=\n|Ship yard number=365\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=10 January 1959\n|Ship sponsor=\n|Ship completed=1960\n|Ship in service=1960\u20131992\n|Ship identification={{IMO number|5242495}}\n|Ship fate=Broken up in 1992\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=[[Moskva-class icebreaker|''Moskva''-class]] [[icebreaker]]\n|Ship tonnage=\n|Ship displacement=13,290 tonnes (design){{br}}15,360 tonnes (maximum)\n|Ship length={{convert|122.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship beam={{convert|24.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught={{convert|9.50|m|ft|abbr=on}} (design){{br}}{{convert|10.50|m|ft|abbr=on}} (maximum)\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship power=8{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 9MH51 (8{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}3,250{{nbsp}}hp)\n|Ship propulsion=[[Diesel-electric]]; three shafts{{br}}{{convert|22000|hp|kW|abbr=on|-2}}\n|Ship speed={{convert|18|kn}}\n|Ship range=\n|Ship endurance=\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship capacity=\n|Ship crew=109\n|Ship aircraft facilities=Helideck and hangar\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n\n'''''Moskva''''' ({{lang-rus|\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430}}; literally: [[Moscow]]) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] polar [[icebreaker]] and the [[lead ship]] of a series of five [[diesel-electric]] icebreakers named after major Soviet cities.

He listed the requirements on a sheet of paper. Wahlforss called the Hietalahti shipyard manager Eric Holmstr\u00f6m and the company's icebreaker specialist Ernst B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m to a meeting asking: \"Are we able to construct such a ship?\" B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m answered directly: \"Yes, we are.\" Subsequently, B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m made a 1:500-scaled sketch of the new 22,000-hp icebreaker in relation to Kapitan-class. Wahlforss took the drawing with him in 1954 to a meeting in Moscow where he had dinner with Mikoyan. When Mikoyan opened the discussion about the new icebreaker concept, Wahlforss took the drawing from his suitcase asking \"Is this what you need?\". Mikoyan became very delighted and said: \"For three years I have asked from our own shipyards for possibility to construct such a icebreaker, but I have only got headshaking!\"<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\">{{cite book |last=Zilliacus |first=Benedict |year=1984 |chapter= \u00bbSeitsem\u00e4ntoista sanaa\u00bb |title=Wilhelm Wahlforss |language=Finnish |others=Translated from Swedish by Riitta Valaj\u00e4rvi |location=Porvoo |publisher=Oy W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Ab |pages=283\u2013295 |isbn=951-99541-8-X }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 1956, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 and [[Sudoimport]], the Soviet foreign trade organization with a monopoly for the foreign trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract for the construction of two polar icebreakers. While only half as powerful as the 44,000{{nbsp}}hp ''Lenin'', the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time.<ref name=\"wartsila\"/> The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's engineering expertise to a tough test. At the end, however, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 could deliver what Wahlforss had promised. Few years later, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 received a follow-up order for three more icebreakers of the same design.<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\"/>\n\nThe hull of the icebreaker was assembled on a [[slipway]] and launched on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the entrance channel had to be [[dredging|dredged]]. In addition, a special steel pontoon had to be constructed and welded to the stern of the icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> In the [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching ceremony]], the new icebreaker was given the name ''Moskva'' after [[Moscow|the capital city]]. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and ''Moskva'' was delivered during the summer of 1960.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n== Service history ==\n\nIn October 1961, after assisting more than a hundred cargo ships in the Russian Arctic during the autumn navigating season, ''Moskva'' completed an eastbound transit of the Northern Sea Route from [[Murmansk]] to [[Vladivostok]] in only 10 days. This was both a record time as well as the latest time a successful transit had been completed before the winter, and demonstrated how the shipping season could be extended with modern icebreakers.<ref name=\"polarpost\" /> Afterwards, ''Moskva'' was stationed in [[Vladivostok]] and used to escort in the eastern part of the Northern Sea Route.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" />\n\nOn 20 October 1965, ''Moskva'' and her sister ship [[Leningrad (icebreaker)|''Leningrad'']] came to assist ''Vitimles'', a merchant ship that had been waiting for icebreaker assistance for 30 days in the [[East Siberian Sea]].<ref name=\"marchenko\">{{cite book |last=Marchenko |first=Nataliya |year=2012 |title=Russian Arctic Seas |url= |location= |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-22124-8 |accessdate= }}</ref> However, by the time the icebreakers arrived, the pack ice had begun to drift at a considerable speed and a dangerous phenomenon known as \"ice jet\" appeared,<ref>Weintrit, A. and Neumann, T.

However, already by the mid-1980s the icebreaker was described as being \"definitely past its prime\".<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" />\n\nFollowing the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the traffic volumes along the Northern Sea Route declined drastically in the early 1990s due to the slowdown of the Russian economy.

At the widest point of the hull, the vessel had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.50|m|ft|0}}, but due to the sloping sides the maximum beam at waterline was slightly less, {{convert|23.50|m|ft|0}}. At design waterline, the icebreaker drew {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} of water and had a displacement of 13,290 tonnes. However, the maximum draught of the vessel was {{convert|10.5|m|ft|0}}, corresponding to a maximum displacement of 15,360 tonnes. ''Moskva'' was the largest non-nuclear icebreaker in the world at the time of the delivery,<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> having almost twice the displacement of the largest western icebreakers.\n\nDesigned to withstand the compression of the polar pack ice, the fully welded steel hull of ''Moskva'' was very strong. The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide ice belt, where the hull plating was over {{convert|50|mm|in}} thick in the bow, was designed to withstand ice pressures of up to 1,000 tonnes per square meter (about {{convert|9.81|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on|disp=out}}), more than 30 to 60 times as much as normal merchant ships at the time. In bow and stern, the web frames were aligned perpendicularly to the shell plating. Longitudinally, the hull was divided into nine watertight compartments and the vessel had a full-length double hull below tweendeck.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n''Moskva'' had single and double cabins for 109 persons. In addition to vessel crew and aviation detachment, accommodation and laboratories were reserved for scientists when the icebreaker carried out research expeditions in the polar waters. Special attention had been paid to the furnishing and decoration of the public spaces, which included a game room and a music room with a piano for the officers. The icebreaker was delivered from the shipyard with a total of three television sets.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nDesigned to escort merchant ships through ice-covered waters, ''Moskva'' had a towing winch and a notch in the stern where the bow of the towed ship would be pulled. For ice reconnaissance, the icebreaker had a helicopter hangar and a landing platform in the stern. The vessel had two motor lifeboats for 60 persons and two 70-person lifeboats with manually operated propeller. In addition, the icebreaker carried a {{convert|11.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} motor [[launch (boat)|launch]] with a steel hull, a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} aluminum boat, two fiberglass ice sledge-boats, a {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} rowing boat and a light aluminum dinghy. The boats were launched using the icebreakers' two 10-ton deck cranes.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\n''Moskva'' was a diesel-electric icebreaker with a power plant consisting of eight [[straight-nine engine|9-cylinder]] W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 9MH51 single-acting [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engines]], each of which was rated at 3,250{{nbsp}}hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to [[Siemens]] [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive system]]. Normally, four generators were connected to the tandem electric motor driving the centerline propeller shaft and two generators to the propulsion motors driving the wing shafts, but the system allowed connecting two generators from the center circuit to either port or starboard circuit and vice versa in case of engine failure.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nThe electric power produced by the main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500{{nbsp}}hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500{{nbsp}}hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nWith an overall propulsion power of 22,000{{nbsp}}hp, ''Moskva'' was at the time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered ''Lenin'' which, at 44,000{{nbsp}}hp, had twice the power of the ''Moskva''-class icebreakers.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built [[USS Glacier (AGB-4)|USS ''Glacier'']], had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500{{nbsp}}hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as ''Moskva'', the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four hours at a time and the total continuous rating was only 16,900{{nbsp}}hp.<ref>[http://www.mxak.org/community/icepick/icepick5.pdf The Icebreaker USS/USCGC Glacier]. {{retrieved|accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:1959 ships]]\n[[Category:Icebreakers of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Helsinki]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the Soviet Union]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moskva_(1959_icebreaker)"}

To teach him a lesson, he sends Vijay to Bhamapura to help the poor. Vijay doesn't want to go, but a local pizza restaurateur convinces Vijay and his friends that the village is one big brothel. In reality, Bhamapura is a sacred village and the restaurateur had purposefully deceived Vijay and his friends. Divya (Soundarya Jayamala) and her classmates also visit the village. They come for their social activity course to improve the village's health and hygiene. A large building is reserved for him and the girls are asked to stay in the poor families' houses. Vijay and his friends arrive and start to woo the girls, whom they mistake for Bhamapura's prostitutes. When Divya discovers their plan, she and her friends decide to teach Vijay and his friends a lesson.\n\nVijay and his friends are wooed by Divya and the other girls. They are led to separate rooms where the girls inject a serum that makes them itch all over. They leave, screaming and scratching. Vijay tells Divya to leave her profession and offers to save her honour by marrying her in the village temple the next day. Divya doesn't come, but Vijay and his friends happen to see her leaving on a bus bearing the name of the girls' college, revealing that they have been duped. When Vijay returns home, Shivsagar discovers that his son has fallen in love. With his influence, Vijay and Divya get engaged. Later, Vijay goes to Divya's house in a drunken state. Her family prevent him from talking to her. This eventually leads to a fight. Vijay then goes to Divya's cousin's house to meet Divya and apologise for his behaviour but suddenly attempts to rape Divya's cousin. Then on the same day at night, Vijay tries to kill Shivasagar, but is luckily stopped by Ko Thanda ([[Ramesh Bhat]]) and is stabbed by Vijay. Disappointed with Vijay's behaviour, Shivasagar sends Vijay to a therapist.\n\nHere enters Ajay (Upendra's third role), Vijay's twin. Assuming Vijay's identity, he had taken money from the bank, got drunk and went to Divya's place and attempted to rape Divya's cousin. Ajay hates Shivasagar for leaving him and his mentally-challenged mother (Catherine Tresa). Later, Divya manages to sneak into Vijay's room in the hospital and believes his explanation that he is innocent. She leaves and shortly afterwards, Ajay appears, smuggles and dumps Vijay out of the hospital, takes over his identity and goes to kill Shivasagar. The father notices that it's not his son and gets out of his wheelchair to defend himself. Vijay arrives at the scene, surprised that his father is able to walk and demands an explanation.\n\nShivasagar tells him that he was a dancer who behaved effeminately due to dancing. His mother had arranged for Shivasagar to marry her friend's daughter (Ajay's mother). He agreed but the girl rejected Shivasagar for being too feminine and insults him in front of the wedding crowd. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Shivasagar's mother died on the spot. Shivasagar, enraged, raped the girl, a deed that resulted in her becoming pregnant. The doctor refused to give her an abortion and so Vijay was born. Shivasagar takes his child from her mother saying the child would be the only hope of his life. Shivasagar says he is ignorant of Ajay's existence and the reason for his resemblance to them.\n\nAjay escapes and threatens Vijay and Divya's wedding. Shivasagar attempts to stop him when Ajay's grandmother arrives and explains that Ajay is also Shivasagar's son and Vijay's twin and that Ajay's mother went mad when Ajay was about to get hit by a lorry. Ajay realises his mistake. He wants Shivasagar to shoot him, but the police misunderstand and think that Ajay is pointing a gun at Shivasagar and they fire at Ajay. Shivasagar intervenes and is shot instead. Ajay accepts Shivasagar's apology and is then arrested. Ajay's mother does not accept food from anyone, until Vijay comes dressed up as Ajay and feeds her.

To teach him a lesson, he sends Vijay to Bhamapura to help the poor. Vijay doesn't want to go, but a local pizza restaurateur convinces Vijay and his friends that the village is one big brothel. In reality, Bhamapura is a sacred village and the restaurateur had purposefully deceived Vijay and his friends. Divya ([[Soundarya Jayamala]]) and her classmates also visit the village. They come for their social activity course to improve the village's health and hygiene. A large building is reserved for him and the girls are asked to stay in the poor families' houses. Vijay and his friends arrive and start to woo the girls, whom they mistake for Bhamapura's prostitutes. When Divya discovers their plan, she and her friends decide to teach Vijay and his friends a lesson.\n\nVijay and his friends are wooed by Divya and the other girls. They are led to separate rooms where the girls inject a serum that makes them itch all over. They leave, screaming and scratching. Vijay tells Divya to leave her profession and offers to save her honour by marrying her in the village temple the next day. Divya doesn't come, but Vijay and his friends happen to see her leaving on a bus bearing the name of the girls' college, revealing that they have been duped. When Vijay returns home, Shivsagar discovers that his son has fallen in love. With his influence, Vijay and Divya get engaged. Later, Vijay goes to Divya's house in a drunken state. Her family prevent him from talking to her. This eventually leads to a fight. Vijay then goes to Divya's cousin's house to meet Divya and apologise for his behaviour but suddenly attempts to rape Divya's cousin. Then on the same day at night, Vijay tries to kill Shivasagar, but is luckily stopped by Ko Thanda ([[Ramesh Bhat]]) and is stabbed by Vijay. Disappointed with Vijay's behaviour, Shivasagar sends Vijay to a therapist.\n\nHere enters Ajay (Upendra's third role), Vijay's twin. Assuming Vijay's identity, he had taken money from the bank, got drunk and went to Divya's place and attempted to rape Divya's cousin. Ajay hates Shivasagar for leaving him and his mentally-challenged mother ([[Catherine Tresa]]). Later, Divya manages to sneak into Vijay's room in the hospital and believes his explanation that he is innocent. She leaves and shortly afterwards, Ajay appears, smuggles and dumps Vijay out of the hospital, takes over his identity and goes to kill Shivasagar. The father notices that it's not his son and gets out of his wheelchair to defend himself. Vijay arrives at the scene, surprised that his father is able to walk and demands an explanation.\n\nShivasagar tells him that he was a dancer who behaved effeminately due to dancing. His mother had arranged for Shivasagar to marry her friend's daughter (Ajay's mother). He agreed but the girl rejected Shivasagar for being too feminine and insults him in front of the wedding crowd. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Shivasagar's mother died on the spot. Shivasagar, enraged, raped the girl, a deed that resulted in her becoming pregnant. The doctor refused to give her an abortion and so Vijay was born. Shivasagar takes his child from her mother saying the child would be the only hope of his life. Shivasagar says he is ignorant of Ajay's existence and the reason for his resemblance to them.\n\nAjay escapes and threatens Vijay and Divya's wedding. Shivasagar attempts to stop him when Ajay's grandmother arrives and explains that Ajay is also Shivasagar's son and Vijay's twin and that Ajay's mother went mad when Ajay was about to get hit by a lorry. Ajay realises his mistake. He wants Shivasagar to shoot him, but the police misunderstand and think that Ajay is pointing a gun at Shivasagar and they fire at Ajay. Shivasagar intervenes and is shot instead. Ajay accepts Shivasagar's apology and is then arrested. Ajay's mother does not accept food from anyone, until Vijay comes dressed up as Ajay and feeds her. The film ends with Vijay stating that Shivasagar is the [[godparent|godfather]] of the family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] as Shivasagar and Vijay and Ajay (Triple Role)\n* [[Soundarya Jayamala]] as Divya\n* [[Catherine Tresa]] as Vaani, Shiva Sagar's      wife\n* [[Ramesh Bhat]] Ko-Dhanda (Old man's servant)\n* [[Hema Chaudhary]] (Shiva's mother)\n* [[Bhumika Chawla]] in a special appearance\n* [[Sihi Kahi Chandru]] as Restaurant Manager\n* [[Padmaja Rao]] (Divya's Friend)\n* [[Keerthiraj]] as Divya's brother\n* [[Satyajit]] as Ajay's Guardian \n* [[Kuri Prathap]] as Vijay's Friend\n* Shweta as Divya's Friend\n* [[Rekha Das]] as Divya's Teacher\n* [[Sudha Belawadi]] as Sujatha\n* Siddaraj Kalyankar as Divya's father\n* G.B Rangashasai\n* [[Suchitra]] as Divya's aunt\n* [[K.

It was won by [[Keir Starmer]] who received 56.2 per cent of the vote on the first round.

Five candidates, [[Rebecca Long-Bailey]], [[Lisa Nandy]], [[Jess Phillips]], [[Keir Starmer]] and [[Emily Thornberry]] received sufficient nominations to proceed to the second round of nominations. Starmer had the most nominations from MPs and MEPs at 88, followed by Long-Bailey and Nandy with 33 and 31 nominations respectively. Phillips and Thornberry each received 23 nominations, one above the minimum threshold to proceed. \n\nThree candidates, Long-Bailey, Nandy and Starmer, received sufficient combined support from affiliates and constituency parties to proceed to the final ballot. Starmer received the most nominations from both CLPs and affiliates having received nominations from 374 CLPs and 15 affiliates, followed by Long-Bailey with 164 CLPs and seven affiliates, and finally Nandy with 72 CLPs and four affiliates.

The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.

The cabinet is not responsible for defense and security issues, as those are handled by the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]]. Thus, the security organizations such as the [[Korean People's Army]], [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]] and [[State Security Department]] report and subordinated directly to the SAC, whose Chairman holds full power as the supreme leader of the republic and the party and overall commander-in-chief of all uniformed forces. The Cabinet convenes a plenary meeting and an executive meeting.<ref>Article 121 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The plenary meeting consists of all the Cabinet members, while the executive meeting  is kind of a [[presidium]], and comprises fewer people, including the Premier, vice premier and other Cabinet members whom the Premier nominates.

and [[executive body]] and a general state-management organ in the [[Government of North Korea]].<ref>Article 123 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The Cabinet's principal newspaper is ''[[Minju Choson]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Park Hon-youn and Ather 1949.jpg|thumb|The cabinet, headed by [[Kim Il-sung]], visiting [[Moscow]] in 1949]]\nIn North Korea's first constitution, adopted in 1948, the executive powers were vested in the Cabinet, chaired by [[Kim Il-sung]] himself. The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.

The cabinet is not responsible for defense and security issues, as those are handled by the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]]. Thus, the security organizations such as the [[Korean People's Army]], [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]] and [[State Security Department]] report and subordinated directly to the SAC, whose Chairman holds full power as the supreme leader of the republic and the party and overall commander-in-chief of all uniformed forces. The Cabinet convenes a plenary meeting and an executive meeting.<ref>Article 121 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The plenary meeting consists of all the Cabinet members, while the executive meeting  is kind of a [[presidium]], and comprises fewer people, including the Premier, vice premier and other Cabinet members whom the Premier nominates.

He studied mathematics at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Georges Clemenceau (Nantes)|Lyc\u00e9e Georges Clemenceau]] in [[Nantes]]. After graduation, Debarre moved to [[Nice]] and first studied primary colors.

The ship, ordered in 2007, was built by [[Uki Workboat]] in [[Uusikaupunki]], [[Finland]], and entered service in May 2011.<ref name=\"syke2011\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development and construction ===\n\nThe development of the new multipurpose vessel began on 25 May 2003 when the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] appointed a work group to investigate the technical requirements and economic aspects of building a new multipurpose [[icebreaker]] capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the [[Gulf of Finland]] had increased from a mere 15 million tons per year in the early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with [[Oil spill#Cleanup and recovery|oil recovery]] equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and [[Emergency tow vessel|emergency towing]] of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist [[oil tanker]]s to the Kilpilahti [[oil refinery]] in [[Porvoo]] during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the work group noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker would have to spend the rest of the year in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.<ref name=\"syke2003\">[http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51495&lan=FI Monitoimimurtajan hankintaa valmistellut ty\u00f6ryhm\u00e4 antoi v\u00e4liraportin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055344/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51495&lan=FI |date=12 March 2012 }}. Finnish Environment Institute, 2.10.2003.</ref>\n\nThe work group published its final report on 31 December 2003 and came to a conclusion that while the proposed vessel would definitely be needed and it would be technically possible to construct one, fulfilling the requirements of the different operators with a single ship would be difficult and, as noted before, remaining on standby during the open water season would be very expensive. The work group estimated that the purchase price of the vessel would be 30\u201370 million euro. One of the proposed alternatives was the conversion of the Finnish multipurpose icebreaker [[Finnish icebreaker Fennica|''Fennica'']], built in 1993, to a spill response vessel, but this was not pursued further.<ref name=\"syke2004\">[http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51410&lan=FI Monitoimimurtajan hankinnassa erilaisia mahdollisuuksia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055432/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51410&lan=FI |date=12 March 2012 }}.

Its [[pennant number]] is 999.<ref name=\"syke2011\" />\n\nThe first [[Finnish minelayer Louhi|''Louhi'']] was a minelayer, built in 1917 as ''Voin'', that was left behind by withdrawing [[Russian Navy]]. The newly founded Finnish Navy acquired the ship and renamed it first ''M-1'' (''Miinalaiva 1'', [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for ''Minelayer 1'') in 1918 and finally ''Louhi'' in 1936. On 12 January 1945, when the ship was laying mines with minelayer [[Finnish minelayer Ruotsinsalmi|''Ruotsinsalmi'']] at the [[Gulf of Finland]], it was hit either by a mine or a torpedo from a [[Kriegsmarine|German]] [[U-boat]]. The first ''Louhi'' sank in two minutes with a loss of 11 lives.<ref>[[:fi:Miinalaiva Louhi|Miinalaiva Louhi]] {{in lang|fi}}</ref>\n\nThe second ''Louhi'' was built in 1939 as icebreaker [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']] and handed over to the Navy in 1970, renamed and given pennant number 90. The ship served as a support ship for [[Tuima class missile boat|''Tuima'' class missile boats]] and [[Turunmaa class gunboat|''Turunmaa'' class gunboats]], towing them during transit journeys. The second ''Louhi'' was decommissioned and scrapped in 1986 mainly because it had become nearly impossible to get spare parts for the old engines.<ref>[[:fi:Sisu (1939)|J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Sisu (1939)]] {{in lang|fi}}</ref>\n\n=== Operational career ===\n\nOn 24 December 2011 ''Louhi'' and [[Linja (ship)|''Linja'']], another Finnish spill response vessel, were dispatched to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] as a precaution after a [[tall oil]] spill from [[Rh\u00f4ne Group#Arizona Chemical|Arizona Chemical]] plant near [[S\u00f6derhamn]] in [[Sweden]].

The ship, ordered in 2007, was built by [[Uki Workboat]] in [[Uusikaupunki]], [[Finland]], and entered service in May 2011.<ref name=\"syke2011\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development and construction ===\n\nThe development of the new multipurpose vessel began on 25 May 2003 when the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] appointed a work group to investigate the technical requirements and economic aspects of building a new multipurpose [[icebreaker]] capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the [[Gulf of Finland]] had increased from a mere 15 million tons per year in the early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with [[Oil spill#Cleanup and recovery|oil recovery]] equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and [[Emergency tow vessel|emergency towing]] of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist [[oil tanker]]s to the Kilpilahti [[oil refinery]] in [[Porvoo]] during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the work group noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker would have to spend the rest of the year in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.<ref name=\"syke2003\">[http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51495&lan=FI Monitoimimurtajan hankintaa valmistellut ty\u00f6ryhm\u00e4 antoi v\u00e4liraportin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055344/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51495&lan=FI |date=12 March 2012 }}.

The work group estimated that the purchase price of the vessel would be 30\u201370 million euro. One of the proposed alternatives was the conversion of the Finnish multipurpose icebreaker [[Finnish icebreaker Fennica|''Fennica'']], built in 1993, to a spill response vessel, but this was not pursued further.<ref name=\"syke2004\">[http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51410&lan=FI Monitoimimurtajan hankinnassa erilaisia mahdollisuuksia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055432/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=51410&lan=FI |date=12 March 2012 }}.

On 12 January 1945, when the ship was laying mines with minelayer [[Finnish minelayer Ruotsinsalmi|''Ruotsinsalmi'']] at the [[Gulf of Finland]], it was hit either by a mine or a torpedo from a [[Kriegsmarine|German]] [[U-boat]]. The first ''Louhi'' sank in two minutes with a loss of 11 lives.<ref>[[:fi:Miinalaiva Louhi|Miinalaiva Louhi]] {{in lang|fi}}</ref>\n\nThe second ''Louhi'' was built in 1939 as icebreaker [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']] and handed over to the Navy in 1970, renamed and given pennant number 90. The ship served as a support ship for [[Tuima class missile boat|''Tuima'' class missile boats]] and [[Turunmaa class gunboat|''Turunmaa'' class gunboats]], towing them during transit journeys. The second ''Louhi'' was decommissioned and scrapped in 1986 mainly because it had become nearly impossible to get spare parts for the old engines.<ref>[[:fi:Sisu (1939)|J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Sisu (1939)]] {{in lang|fi}}</ref>\n\n=== Operational career ===\n\nOn 24 December 2011 ''Louhi'' and [[Linja (ship)|''Linja'']], another Finnish spill response vessel, were dispatched to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] as a precaution after a [[tall oil]] spill from [[Rh\u00f4ne Group#Arizona Chemical|Arizona Chemical]] plant near [[S\u00f6derhamn]] in [[Sweden]].

The system consists of a dampening channel that guides the oil to the recovery system on the other side of the ship.<ref name=\"hanninen\" /> Spilled oil surrounded by [[Boom (containment)|oil booms]] can also be collected by two free-floating skimmers connected to the vessel by a flexible pipe.<ref name=\"syke2011tekniset\" /><ref name=\"lamor_louhi\" />\n\nAs the recovery systems designed for open water can not be used efficiently or at all during wintertime, ''Louhi'' is also equipped with two recovery systems capable of collecting spilled oil from the sea in difficult ice conditions and clean ice blocks covered in oil. The main recovery system consists of four large brushes controlled by individual crane arms installed on the stern deck. The system, developed specifically for this vessel, has a sweeping width of {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=out}} and recovers oil from the sea as the vessel moves astern in ice. In addition the vessel has two Lamor LRB-series oil recovery buckets that have large rotating brushes that resemble those of [[street sweeper]]s and are used in a similar fashion. Despite their limited recovery capacity, the brush buckets operated by the ship's cranes have been proven to be effective in ice conditions in the past, such as that of ''Runner 4'' in 2006.<ref name=\"syke2011tekniset\" /><ref name=\"lamor_louhi\">[http://www.lamor.com/2011/04/finland%E2%80%99s-newest-oil-spill-response-vessel/ Finland\u2019s Newest Oil Spill Response Vessel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050021/http://www.lamor.com/2011/04/finland%E2%80%99s-newest-oil-spill-response-vessel/ |date=14 June 2011 }}.

He appeared at the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] and began to develop a reputation as a songwriter. [[Ian and Sylvia|Ian and Sylvia Tyson]] recorded \"Early Mornin' Rain\" and \"For Lovin' Me\"; a year later both songs were recorded by [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; other performers who recorded one or both of these songs included [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chad & Jeremy]], [[George Hamilton IV]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], and the [[Johnny Mann|Johnny Mann Singers]]. Established recording artists such as [[Marty Robbins]] (\"[[Ribbon of Darkness]]\"), [[Leroy Van Dyke]] (\"I'm Not Saying\"), [[Judy Collins]] (\"Early Morning Rain\"), [[Richie Havens]] and [[Spyder Turner]] (\"I Can't Make It Anymore\"), and [[The Kingston Trio]] (\"Early Morning Rain\") all achieved chart success with Gordon Lightfoot's material.\n\n==United Artists years==\n[[File:Gordon Lightfoot at Apex Records luncheon.jpg|thumb|Lightfoot, right, at a music industry function in Toronto in 1965]]\nIn 1965, Lightfoot signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]], who also represented many prominent American folk performers, and signed a recording contract with [[United Artists]] who released his version of \"[[I'm Not Sayin']]\" as a single. Appearances at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album ''[[Lightfoot!]]'', which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including \"For Lovin' Me,\" \"Early Mornin' Rain,\" \"Steel Rail Blues,\" and \"Ribbon of Darkness\". On the strength of the ''Lightfoot!'' album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it.\n\nTo kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the \"[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]\" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including \"Go-Go Round\", \"Spin, Spin\", and \"The Way I Feel\". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' featured \"Black Day in July\", about the 1967 Detroit riot.  The following April 4, Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] was murdered; radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for \"fanning the flames\", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs \"that make people happy\" and not those \"that make people think.\"  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with \"If You Could Read My Mind\".\n\nLightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer.\n\nHis success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City. Between 1967 and 1974, Lightfoot toured Europe and was well-received on two tours of Australia.\n\nUA continued to release \"Best of\" album compilations in the 1970s even after Lightfoot became a subsequent success at Warner Bros./Reprise.\n\n==Warner Bros./Reprise years==\nLightfoot signed to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 and scored a major hit in the United States with \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]],\" which sold over one million copies by early 1971 and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/282 282]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/282\n}}</ref> The song had originally appeared on the poorly-selling 1970 album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]].'' After the song's success, the album was reissued under the new title ''If You Could Read My Mind;'' it reached No.&nbsp;5 nationally and represented a major turning point in Lightfoot's career. The album also featured a second recorded version of \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\", as well as \"The Pony Man,\" \"Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster),\" and \"Minstrel of the Dawn.\"\n\nOver the next seven years, he recorded a series of successful albums that established him as a singer-songwriter:\n* ''[[Summer Side of Life]]'' (1971), with songs \"Ten Degrees and Getting Colder\", \"Miguel\", \"Cabaret\", \"Nous Vivons Ensemble\", and the title track\n* ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' (1972), with \"Beautiful\", \"Looking at the Rain\", \"Christian Island (Georgian Bay)\", and the title track, which is a concert favorite\n* ''[[Old Dan's Records]]'' (1972), with the title track, the two-sided single \"That Same Old Obsession\"/\"You Are What I Am\", and the songs \"It's Worth Believin'\" and \"Can't Depend on Love\"\n* ''[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Sundown]]'' (1974).

The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. \"Carefree Highway\" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album. It charted in the Top 10 in both countries.<ref>{{cite web|author=William R.

It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and continues personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald.org/gordon-lightfoot-song/|title=\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by Gordon Lightfoot|publisher=S S Edmund Fitzgerald Online|date=|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Sundown\" and \"The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald''\" continue to receive heavy airplay on many classic rock stations{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}. In 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of \"The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes),\" which reached number 33.\n\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold, Vol. 2]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).\n\nThe album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as \"Ghosts of Cape Horn\" and \"On the High Seas\". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition \"The Auctioneer,\" a bluegrass-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid 1960s to the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Songs like \"Shadows\" and \"Thank You for the Promises\" contain an underlying sadness and resignation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The 1982 American released single \"Baby Step Back\" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.\nThe 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like \"A Passing Ship\",\"Morning Glory\", and \"I'll Tag Along\" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', \"Anything for Love\", made the Billboard Country & Western chart. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song \"The Greatest Love of All,\" versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song \"If You Could Read My Mind\". The transitional section that begins \"I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow\" of the Masser song has the same melody as \"I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back\" of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Florian BODENSEHER |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/biography.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot \u2013 Biography |publisher=Corfid.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storyofsongs.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-love.html |title=Greatest Love |accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLightfoot rounded out the decade with his follow-up compilation ''[[Gord's Gold, Vol. 2]],'' in late 1988, which contained re-recorded versions of his most popular songs, including a re-make of the 1970 song \"The Pony Man.\" The original had been brisk in pace, acoustic, and about three minutes long. This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus.\n\nLightfoot performed with noted Canadian artist Ian Tyson at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 winter Olympics in Calgary.  \n \nDuring the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as \"Restless\", \"Wild Strawberries\", and Bob Dylan's \"Ring Them Bells\".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} with songs like \"Much to My Surprise\", \"Red Velvet\", \"Drifters\", and \"I Used to Be a Country Singer\". Throughout the decade, Lightfoot played about 50 concerts a year.<ref>{{cite web|author=William R. Weiss |url=http://www.lightfoot.ca/tourschd.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot Tour Schedules |publisher=Lightfoot.ca |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> In 1999 Rhino Records released ''[[Songbook (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Songbook]]'', a four-CD boxed set of Lightfoot recordings with rare and unreleased tracks from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s plus a small hardback booklet for his fans that described how he created his songs and gave facts about his career.\n\nIn April 2000, Lightfoot taped a live concert in [[Reno, Nevada]]; this one-hour show was broadcast by CBC in October, and as a PBS special across the United States. PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed \"Ring Them Bells\" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.\n\n==Illness and return to performing==\nBy January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to McMaster Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario. He underwent surgery for a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-is-happy-to-be-all-live|title=Gordon Lightfoot is happy to be All Live|date=April 27, 2012|website=nationalpost.com|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.\n\nIn 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a related label to Linus Entertainment, released ''[[Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot]]''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and The [[Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, \"Lightfoot\", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].\n\nIn January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for \"Inspiration Lady\". Other songs were \"Clouds of Loneliness,\" \"Sometimes I Wish,\" \"Flyin' Blind\", and \"No Mistake About It\". The album contained the upbeat yet reflective track called \"End of All Time\"\n\nIn July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing \"I'll Tag Along\" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].\n\nLightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance \u2013 on their own instruments \u2013 of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''. In 2005, he made a low-key tour called the ''Better Late Than Never Tour''.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that eventually left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand. He returned to performing nine days later and for a brief time used a substitute guitarist for more difficult guitar work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onmilwaukee.com/music/articles/lightfoot.html |title=Music: Stroke doesn't diminish Lightfoots skills as an entertainer |publisher=Onmilwaukee.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Denis Armstrong |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710212859/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=CANOE \u2013 JAM!

Shea left the touring band in 1970, but continued to record with Lightfoot until 1975. He hosted his own Canadian variety show, played with Ian Tyson, and became band leader for [[Tommy Hunter]]'s TV show in the 1980s on CBC. Shea played on most of Lightfoot's early hits.  Haynes and Clements remained with Lightfoot and composed the core of his band.\n\nIn 1975, Pee Wee Charles added [[pedal steel]] guitar to Lightfoot's songs. Drummer Barry Keane joined the following year and in 1981, keyboardist Mike Heffernan completed the ensemble.

His first marriage in April 1963 was to a Swedish woman, Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot has acknowledged that his musical touring and the difficulty of fidelity in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.\n\nThe song \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performs the lyrics with a slight change now: the line \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack\" is altered to \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack.\" He has said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.\n\nLightfoot was unmarried for 16 years. Lightfoot has two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages:  Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>[http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html \"Gord's eldest children\"]; Gordon Lightfoot Forums.

He appeared at the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] and began to develop a reputation as a songwriter. [[Ian and Sylvia|Ian and Sylvia Tyson]] recorded \"Early Mornin' Rain\" and \"For Lovin' Me\"; a year later both songs were recorded by [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; other performers who recorded one or both of these songs included [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chad & Jeremy]], [[George Hamilton IV]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], and the [[Johnny Mann|Johnny Mann Singers]]. Established recording artists such as [[Marty Robbins]] (\"[[Ribbon of Darkness]]\"), [[Leroy Van Dyke]] (\"I'm Not Saying\"), [[Judy Collins]] (\"Early Morning Rain\"), [[Richie Havens]] and [[Spyder Turner]] (\"I Can't Make It Anymore\"), and [[The Kingston Trio]] (\"Early Morning Rain\") all achieved chart success with Gordon Lightfoot's material.\n\n==United Artists years==\n[[File:Gordon Lightfoot at Apex Records luncheon.jpg|thumb|Lightfoot, right, at a music industry function in Toronto in 1965]]\nIn 1965, Lightfoot signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]], who also represented many prominent American folk performers, and signed a recording contract with [[United Artists]] who released his version of \"[[I'm Not Sayin']]\" as a single. Appearances at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album ''[[Lightfoot!]]'', which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including \"For Lovin' Me,\" \"Early Mornin' Rain,\" \"Steel Rail Blues,\" and \"Ribbon of Darkness\". On the strength of the ''Lightfoot!'' album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it.\n\nTo kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the \"[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]\" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including \"Go-Go Round\", \"Spin, Spin\", and \"The Way I Feel\". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' featured \"Black Day in July\", about the 1967 Detroit riot.  The following April 4, Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] was murdered; radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for \"fanning the flames\", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs \"that make people happy\" and not those \"that make people think.\"  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with \"If You Could Read My Mind\".\n\nLightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer.\n\nHis success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City. Between 1967 and 1974, Lightfoot toured Europe and was well-received on two tours of Australia.\n\nUA continued to release \"Best of\" album compilations in the 1970s even after Lightfoot became a subsequent success at Warner Bros./Reprise.\n\n==Warner Bros./Reprise years==\nLightfoot signed to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 and scored a major hit in the United States with \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]],\" which sold over one million copies by early 1971 and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/282 282]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/282\n}}</ref> The song had originally appeared on the poorly-selling 1970 album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]].'' After the song's success, the album was reissued under the new title ''If You Could Read My Mind;'' it reached No.&nbsp;5 nationally and represented a major turning point in Lightfoot's career. The album also featured a second recorded version of \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\", as well as \"The Pony Man,\" \"Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster),\" and \"Minstrel of the Dawn.\"\n\nOver the next seven years, he recorded a series of successful albums that established him as a singer-songwriter:\n* ''[[Summer Side of Life]]'' (1971), with songs \"Ten Degrees and Getting Colder\", \"Miguel\", \"Cabaret\", \"Nous Vivons Ensemble\", and the title track\n* ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' (1972), with \"Beautiful\", \"Looking at the Rain\", \"Christian Island (Georgian Bay)\", and the title track, which is a concert favorite\n* ''[[Old Dan's Records]]'' (1972), with the title track, the two-sided single \"That Same Old Obsession\"/\"You Are What I Am\", and the songs \"It's Worth Believin'\" and \"Can't Depend on Love\"\n* ''[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Sundown]]'' (1974).

The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. \"Carefree Highway\" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album. It charted in the Top 10 in both countries.<ref>{{cite web|author=William R.

It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada.

In 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of \"The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes),\" which reached number 33.\n\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold, Vol. 2]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).\n\nThe album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as \"Ghosts of Cape Horn\" and \"On the High Seas\". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition \"The Auctioneer,\" a bluegrass-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid 1960s to the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Songs like \"Shadows\" and \"Thank You for the Promises\" contain an underlying sadness and resignation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The 1982 American released single \"Baby Step Back\" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.\nThe 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like \"A Passing Ship\",\"Morning Glory\", and \"I'll Tag Along\" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', \"Anything for Love\", made the Billboard Country & Western chart. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song \"The Greatest Love of All,\" versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song \"If You Could Read My Mind\". The transitional section that begins \"I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow\" of the Masser song has the same melody as \"I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back\" of Lightfoot's song.

This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus.\n\nLightfoot performed with noted Canadian artist Ian Tyson at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 winter Olympics in Calgary.  \n \nDuring the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as \"Restless\", \"Wild Strawberries\", and Bob Dylan's \"Ring Them Bells\".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} with songs like \"Much to My Surprise\", \"Red Velvet\", \"Drifters\", and \"I Used to Be a Country Singer\".

PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed \"Ring Them Bells\" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.\n\n==Illness and return to performing==\nBy January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to McMaster Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario.

More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.\n\nIn 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a related label to Linus Entertainment, released ''[[Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot]]''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and The [[Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, \"Lightfoot\", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].\n\nIn January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for \"Inspiration Lady\".

The album contained the upbeat yet reflective track called \"End of All Time\"\n\nIn July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing \"I'll Tag Along\" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].\n\nLightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance \u2013 on their own instruments \u2013 of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''. In 2005, he made a low-key tour called the ''Better Late Than Never Tour''.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that eventually left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand.

Shea left the touring band in 1970, but continued to record with Lightfoot until 1975. He hosted his own Canadian variety show, played with Ian Tyson, and became band leader for [[Tommy Hunter]]'s TV show in the 1980s on CBC. Shea played on most of Lightfoot's early hits.  Haynes and Clements remained with Lightfoot and composed the core of his band.\n\nIn 1975, Pee Wee Charles added [[pedal steel]] guitar to Lightfoot's songs.

His first marriage in April 1963 was to a Swedish woman, Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot has acknowledged that his musical touring and the difficulty of fidelity in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.\n\nThe song \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performs the lyrics with a slight change now: the line \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack\" is altered to \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack.\" He has said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.\n\nLightfoot was unmarried for 16 years. Lightfoot has two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages:  Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>[http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html \"Gord's eldest children\"]; Gordon Lightfoot Forums.

The first [[professional baseball]] [[baseball league|league]] (now the [[Honkbal Hoofdklasse]]) began in {{By|1922}}. The national governing body for baseball is the [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Baseball en Softball Bond]] (Royal Netherlands Baseball and Softball Federation).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/world/europe/21dutch.html|title=In Netherlands, Soccer Is King, but Baseball Eyes Crown|date=21 May 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Netherlands National Baseball Team]] is consistently ranked in the top ten of the [[WBSC World Rankings]] and has won the [[European Baseball Championship]] twenty times. Although baseball is a minority sport within the Netherlands, it is the main sport of the Dutch overseas territories in the Caribbean (the former [[Netherlands Antilles]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/31/the-unknown-caribbean-island-breeding-baseball-stars.html|title=The Unknown Caribbean Island Breeding Baseball Stars|first=Nadette De|last=Visser|date=31 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1911 - 1940===\nThe driving force in the early days of Dutch baseball was J.C.G. Gras\u00e9 of Amsterdam. After discovering baseball while on vacation in the United States, he introduced the game in the Netherlands in 1911. An English teacher by profession, Gras\u00e9 was able to translate the rules of the game into Dutch. The first official games were played in 1911 and on March 12, 1912, Gras\u00e9 founded the '''Dutch Baseball Union'''. Gras\u00e9 was also the founder of the oldest baseball club in Europe, Quick Amsterdam (founded 1 March 1913).\n\nThe first official competition was played in 1922. The major league was formed out of four clubs that year: [[Ajax HVA|Ajax]] (a branch of the famous [[football club]]), [[Blauw-Wit Amsterdam|Blue White]] (also a football club), Hercules and [[AHC Quick|Quick Amsterdam]]. Quick Amsterdam became the first Dutch champion.\nDuring the early years, baseball was only played in Amsterdam, but quickly spread to [[Haarlem]] as well. These two cities dominated Dutch baseball until 1963.\n\nIn 1925, a ship of the [[US Navy]] visited Amsterdam. Players of Blue White heard of the visit and invited the sailors to a game of baseball. After one inning, the Americans led 14-0. After two hours of play, the final score was 27-2.\n\nIn the early days, the [[pitcher]] was the one who could throw the fastest ball. At the time, it was considered unsportsmanlike to bunt or to take advantage of the lack of control by a pitcher and it was considered a humiliation to get a [[base on balls]]. It was far better to hit a fly out than to reach first base on four balls. Furthermore, the sport was played wearing [[short pants|shorts]].\n\nAt the end of the 1937 season, EDO from Haarlem and Blue White from Amsterdam played each other to determine the Dutch champion. The game was played with a two-hour time limit. The coach of EDO thought that he had won the game after the final out of an [[inning]], but according to the umpire, there were three more minutes to be played, so a new inning began. The players of EDO were furious and Blue White ended up winning and became Dutch champion. This was the final instance of a two-hour time limit, and beginning in 1938, games in the major league lasted nine innings.\n\nIn 1939, a team of [[Mormon missionaries]] from [[Salt Lake City]] played in the Dutch league under the name Seagulls. They only lost two games (vs. Blue White from Amsterdam 7-1, and vs. HHC from Haarlem 6-2).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Champions 1922-1939\n|-2019 cardinals lost\n|-\n|\n|-\n|1923||Blue White Amsterdam\n|-\n|1924||[[Ajax HVA|Ajax Amsterdam]]\n|-\n|1925||[[AHC Quick|Quick Amsterdam]]\n|-\n|1926||A.G.H.C.

As the war continued, baseball materials became scarce. Starting in 1943, baseballs were made of rubber-like substance with a cork center. The balls, which were made by the tire company Vredenstein, could absorb little more than a couple of hits, before breaking apart. Some pitchers would cut out a small piece in order to throw a curveball, because the balls didn't have seams. Clubs were forced to mend cracked bats with screws or whatever other materials were handy.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Americans helped Europe rebuild with the [[Marshall Plan]]. They also sent baseball materials to the Netherlands including uniforms, bats, balls, etc. Teams like OVVO from Amsterdam and HHC from Haarlem played in red uniforms.\n\nMany games were played against military teams. In their own league, the Dutch could hold their own, but not against the better skilled Americans. [[Han Urbanus]], was the best Dutch pitcher in these days. Getting a hit against him guaranteed a starting spot in the Dutch national team. A [[Dutch American]] journalist, [[Albert Balink]], managed two trips to spring training camp for Han Urbanus. The journalist knew that the Dutchman would need a lot more experience to improve. Martin Jole, one of the players who could hit Hans Urbanus, went to a spring training camp with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. He showed Dutch players how swinging a bat day after day could improve their hitting.\n\nAlbert Balink also introduced medals for the best players and hitters, which allowed him to show that baseball is a sport of stats. In 1953, Han Urbanus got a phone call from the USA. The [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] had offered him a minor league contract. He refused, due to the fact that he preferred to teach his fellow countrymen what he had learned in the USA.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1953, Dutch baseball was dominated by OVVO from Amsterdam, which claimed five consecutive national titles. In 1955, the club won it for the last time, and would never win another championship again.\n\nThe post-war help of the Americans helped the Dutch earn their first European title in 1956 in Rome, Italy. Han Urbanus was a defensive force and the Dutch batters performed very well. Because of the European title, the Dutch were allowed to go to the Global World Series. American coaches like [[Ron Fraser]] and [[Bill Arce]] helped the Dutch to improve their game. The number of baseball fields built around the country increased dramatically.\n\nIn 1963, a real baseball stadium was built in Haarlem. This stadium would be the base of the [[Haarlem Baseball Week]], a yearly event.\n\nPrior to 1963, baseball was dominated by teams from Amsterdam and Haarlem. But in 1963, [[Sparta-Feyenoord|Sparta]] from Rotterdam became the Dutch champion. From 1963 to 1974, Sparta clinched nine national titles, a record not exceeded until 1985 by the Haarlem Nicols. In the early sixties, each team played 14 games; one game every weekend.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Champions 1940-1969\n2019 cardinals lost\n|-\n|1940||S.C.

He had a very successful Major League career which lasted until 1992, and was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2010.  He was, however, raised in California and never played in the Dutch league.  The first Dutch [[Major League Baseball]] player who actually grew up and learned the game in the Netherlands was [[Win Remmerswaal]], who pitched briefly for the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1979 and 1980.\n\nDutch baseball was dominated by Sparta from Rotterdam in the early 70s. The \"magnificent three\" from the Dutch Antilles were unstoppable: Hudson John, Simon Arrindell and Hamilton Richardson, who all had a big influence on Sparta, but by 1974, the era was over.\n\nAt the end of the 1972 season, the football club Ajax decided to cut loose the baseball branch, ending the ball club.\n\nAt the end of the 1977 season, there was some turmoil at OVVO from Amsterdam. This baseball club was also a branch of a [[Association football|football]] club. The football club, an amateur side, decided to turn professional and begin paying players. The baseball branch did not agree, and big names, like Han Urbanus, decided to leave and founded a new club: Amstel Tigers. Other players like Charles Urbanus Jr. (pitcher/shortstop), Jan Hijzelendoorn (pitcher), Paul Smit (catcher) and Don Wedman decided to follow suit, along with almost the entire team. The Dutch Baseball Federation tried to mediate, but the players did not come back. The city of Amsterdam appointed a terrain in the Western part of the city. The Amstel Tigers thought that field would be too far away, but ultimately the new club built a baseball field there, which is now used by Quick Amsterdam.\n\nIn the meantime, OVVO would not be persuaded to take a step back to a lower division. The Amstel Tigers started their first season in the ''overgangsklasse''; a league one level lower than the hoofdklasse. With such strong players, the Tigers were quickly promoted to the top division in 1979. OVVO's 1978 season was a disaster and the team was relegated. The Amstel Tigers went on to become champions in 1979, 1980, and 1986.\n\nIn 1979, a Dutch pitcher made his MLB debut on the mound in Milwaukee. The Red Sox were trailing 4-1, as they called pitcher Win Remmerswaal. His debut was a good one, even though his team lost 5-3. After the game, journalists seemed fascinated that a Dutch player could have come so far in the game. The MLB career of Win Remmerswaal only lasted two seasons, due to injuries. After the 1980 season, Remmerswaal had pitched in 22 games (3 victories and 1 loss). His short career among baseball's elite lasted 55 innings. After his Major League career, Remmerswaal went to Italy, and played on several teams for many years.\n\nThe eighties and nineties were bad decades for many baseball clubs. In 1986, Charles Urbanus, Jr. decided that it would be his last season. This was a huge blow for his club, the Amstel Tigers. Urbanus was a magnet for players, who considered it an honour to play with him. But an Amstel Tigers without him was not as attractive to new talent and the club lost competitiveness. Eventually, the members voted for a merger with [[HCAW]] from [[Bussum]], a club that was playing the lower league. The new club, HCAW Tigers, were promoted to the major league in 1989 and would go on to win the title in 1996 and 1998, albeit without any of the old Amstel Tigers players. Haarlem Nicols were particularly dominant in the 1980s with seven pennants over ten years, but declared bankruptcy in 1994, just five years after winning their last pennant.\n\nIn 1981, [[Neptunus|Neptunus Rotterdam]] won the pennant for the first time since the baseball team's foundation in 1942. Neptunus began to dominate the championship during the 1990s and 2000s, winning eleven pennants in total including seven consecutively between 1999 and 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Champions 1970-2011\n|-\n!Year!!Club\n|-\n|1970|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1971||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1972||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1973||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1974||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1975|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1976|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1977|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1978|||S.C.

Although baseball is a minority sport within the Netherlands, it is the main sport of the Dutch overseas territories in the Caribbean (the former [[Netherland Antilles]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/31/the-unknown-caribbean-island-breeding-baseball-stars.html|title=The Unknown Caribbean Island Breeding Baseball Stars|first=Nadette De|last=Visser|date=31 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1911 - 1940===\nThe driving force in the early days of Dutch baseball was J.C.G. Gras\u00e9 of Amsterdam. After discovering baseball while on vacation in the United States, he introduced the game in the Netherlands in 1911. An English teacher by profession, Gras\u00e9 was able to translate the rules of the game into Dutch. The first official games were played in 1911 and on March 12, 1912, Gras\u00e9 founded the '''Dutch Baseball Union'''. Gras\u00e9 was also the founder of the oldest baseball club in Europe, Quick Amsterdam (founded 1 March 1913).\n\nThe first official competition was played in 1922. The major league was formed out of four clubs that year: [[Ajax HVA|Ajax]] (a branch of the famous [[football club]]), [[Blauw-Wit Amsterdam|Blue White]] (also a football club), Hercules and [[AHC Quick|Quick Amsterdam]]. Quick Amsterdam became the first Dutch champion.\nDuring the early years, baseball was only played in Amsterdam, but quickly spread to [[Haarlem]] as well. These two cities dominated Dutch baseball until 1963.\n\nIn 1925, a ship of the [[US Navy]] visited Amsterdam. Players of Blue White heard of the visit and invited the sailors to a game of baseball. After one inning, the Americans led 14-0. After two hours of play, the final score was 27-2.\n\nIn the early days, the [[pitcher]] was the one who could throw the fastest ball. At the time, it was considered unsportsmanlike to bunt or to take advantage of the lack of control by a pitcher and it was considered a humiliation to get a [[base on balls]]. It was far better to hit a fly out than to reach first base on four balls. Furthermore, the sport was played wearing [[short pants|shorts]].\n\nAt the end of the 1937 season, EDO from Haarlem and Blue White from Amsterdam played each other to determine the Dutch champion. The game was played with a two-hour time limit. The coach of EDO thought that he had won the game after the final out of an [[inning]], but according to the umpire, there were three more minutes to be played, so a new inning began. The players of EDO were furious and Blue White ended up winning and became Dutch champion. This was the final instance of a two-hour time limit, and beginning in 1938, games in the major league lasted nine innings.\n\nIn 1939, a team of [[Mormon missionaries]] from [[Salt Lake City]] played in the Dutch league under the name Seagulls. They only lost two games (vs. Blue White from Amsterdam 7-1, and vs. HHC from Haarlem 6-2).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Champions 1922-1939\n|-2019 cardinals lost\n|-\n|\n|-\n|1923||Blue White Amsterdam\n|-\n|1924||[[Ajax HVA|Ajax Amsterdam]]\n|-\n|1925||[[AHC Quick|Quick Amsterdam]]\n|-\n|1926||A.G.H.C.

As the war continued, baseball materials became scarce. Starting in 1943, baseballs were made of rubber-like substance with a cork center. The balls, which were made by the tire company Vredenstein, could absorb little more than a couple of hits, before breaking apart. Some pitchers would cut out a small piece in order to throw a curveball, because the balls didn't have seams. Clubs were forced to mend cracked bats with screws or whatever other materials were handy.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Americans helped Europe rebuild with the [[Marshall Plan]]. They also sent baseball materials to the Netherlands including uniforms, bats, balls, etc. Teams like OVVO from Amsterdam and HHC from Haarlem played in red uniforms.\n\nMany games were played against military teams. In their own league, the Dutch could hold their own, but not against the better skilled Americans. [[Han Urbanus]], was the best Dutch pitcher in these days.

The Amstel Tigers went on to become champions in 1979, 1980, and 1986.\n\nIn 1979, a Dutch pitcher made his MLB debut on the mound in Milwaukee. The Red Sox were trailing 4-1, as they called pitcher Win Remmerswaal. His debut was a good one, even though his team lost 5-3. After the game, journalists seemed fascinated that a Dutch player could have come so far in the game. The MLB career of Win Remmerswaal only lasted two seasons, due to injuries. After the 1980 season, Remmerswaal had pitched in 22 games (3 victories and 1 loss). His short career among baseball's elite lasted 55 innings. After his Major League career, Remmerswaal went to Italy, and played on several teams for many years.\n\nThe eighties and nineties were bad decades for many baseball clubs. In 1986, Charles Urbanus, Jr. decided that it would be his last season. This was a huge blow for his club, the Amstel Tigers. Urbanus was a magnet for players, who considered it an honour to play with him. But an Amstel Tigers without him was not as attractive to new talent and the club lost competitiveness. Eventually, the members voted for a merger with [[HCAW]] from [[Bussum]], a club that was playing the lower league. The new club, HCAW Tigers, were promoted to the major league in 1989 and would go on to win the title in 1996 and 1998, albeit without any of the old Amstel Tigers players. Haarlem Nicols were particularly dominant in the 1980s with seven pennants over ten years, but declared bankruptcy in 1994, just five years after winning their last pennant.\n\nIn 1981, [[Neptunus|Neptunus Rotterdam]] won the pennant for the first time since the baseball team's foundation in 1942. Neptunus began to dominate the championship during the 1990s and 2000s, winning eleven pennants in total including seven consecutively between 1999 and 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Champions 1970-2011\n|-\n!Year!!Club\n|-\n|1970|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1971||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1972||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1973||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1974||Sparta Rotterdam\n|-\n|1975|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1976|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1977|||Haarlem Nicols\n|-\n|1978|||S.C.

The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistanis]] share strong Muslim identity. At the time of Malaysia's independence under the [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957]], there were more than two hundred thousand Pakistanis residing in Malaysia, rather than forming a separate group under the categorized system, at the suggestion of Malays themselves, Pakistanis immersed themselves into the Malay group, thus they became part of the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputra]] elite, enriched by social ties, intermarriage, and shared economic and political aspirations. They also took positions in the civil service administration and gradually rose to the upper echelons of government, by then inextricably intermixed with the Malay majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/total-assimilation-outcomes-migration-studies-253532|title=Total Assimilation Outcomes in Migration Studies|website=Channels}}</ref> Many elite Malay families have at least one grandparent that was Pakistani. Diplomats, Judges, Legislators, and other government cadres include people with recognized Pakistani-Malay bloodlines.\n\n===Post independence===\n====1947 to 1970====\n\nEmigration from Pakistan was relatively small between 1947-70. The rapid industrialisation process of Pakistan during the 1950s and 1960s coupled with the introduction of modern agricultural practices pushed out surplus labour leading to mass rural to urban migration, primarily to [[Karachi]].<ref>Sir Rupert Hay, the Persian Gulf States, Middle East Institute, Washington DC, 1959; International Labour Organization, 1945-1957, Geneva, 1959; Quoted in Addleton, 1992</ref> During this time period, the majority of Pakistanis who went abroad considered themselves to be \"sojourners\", who left to earn money abroad but not to settle, or were students who intended to return to Pakistan when their degree programs were completed. By 1971, no more than 900,000 Pakistanis lived abroad with the majority residing in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. In 1959, small numbers of Pakistanis were found to be working in Bahrain, Kuwait and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. By 1960, the Pakistani community in Bahrain numbered 2,200 while almost half of the population in Kuwait comprised non-nationals, and of them a small number came from Pakistan. Pakistan was already the single most important source of non-Arab expatriate labour in the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] (representing about 19% of the workforce) and trailed only Americans among those working for [[Saudi Aramco]] in Saudi Arabia, who represented 6% of the workforce.<ref>Albert Y. Badre and Simon G Siksek, Manpower and Oil in the Arab Countries, Economic Research Institute,\nAmerican University of Beirut, 1960.</ref>\n\nThe first mass migration of Pakistanis began in 1965 during the construction of [[Mangla Dam]] in [[Azad Kashmir|Azad Jammu & Kashmir]]. Over 280 villages around [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Dadyal]] were submerged, which lead to the displacement of over 110,000 people from the region. During the same period, the UK Government were actively seeking people from abroad to work in industrial towns in north-west [[England]] who were suffering from labour shortages. Thus many worker permits for the UK were awarded to the displaced population of Mirpur who were eligible for work.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil \"Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges\", Indiana University, 2013, available at: http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/8833?show=full</ref> Close to 50,000 Pakistanis from Mirpur emigrated to Northern England between 1965-1970.<ref name=eng>{{cite web|title=The Pakistani Muslim Community in England|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1170952.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http:/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1170952.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-19}}</ref><ref name=\"ons.gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations/kashmiri-research-project-2011---final-report.pdf |title=2011 Census Branding Approval Form |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n====1971 to present====\n\nThe availability of large scale labour force from Pakistan owed to a combination of socioeconomic and institutional factors at home. By 1970, Pakistan was passing through a serious economic and political crisis which eventually led to the secession of [[East Pakistan]] in 1971. The rapid economic development of the 1950s and 1960s could not be sustained by 1970 and a wave of nationalisation of business and\nindustry was unfolding under Prime Minister [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. This led to slower large scale industrialisation due to a new wave of industrial unrest and disaffection between industrialists and Bhutto's government which favored nationalisation of banking, large scale trading and industry. Rural to urban migration into Karachi slowed down during the 1970s and 1980s and was substituted by a rising wave of international migration to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Libya. The profile of the work force and their places of origin simply followed the established patterns internal migration routes. These included people from [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20132010)|NWFP]], northern Punjab (Potohar Plateau), the \"Seraiki belt\" in southern Punjab and the hill-tracts of Azad Jammu & Kashmir. Institutionally, a network of information chains to seek work, and the channels for remitting money to families back in Pakistan had already existed. The majority of migrants were young males who would seek work abroad while families would remain back in Pakistan. These channels soon expanded and adapted themselves to new requirements and conditions.<ref>Roger Owen, Migrant Workers in the Gulf, London; Minority Rights Group Report Number 68, September 1985.</ref> During the 1960s and 1970s, the remaining [[Pakistani Jew]]ish community of 2000 began emigrating to [[Israel]] and settled in [[Ramla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishtimesasia.org/community-spotlight-topmenu-43/pakistan/544-pakistan-communities/2806-a-jewish-presence-in-pakistan-karachi-in-another-time|title=A Jewish presence in Pakistan \u2013 Karachi in another time|first=Philip|last=Jay|website=www.jewishtimesasia.org|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday over 8,800,000 Pakistanis live abroad, with an estimated 4,000,000 Pakistanis in the [[Persian Gulf]] region. The expatriate labour force in the Persian Gulf has, however, followed what might be called a \"circulating work force\" pattern. Workers come in, work for a few years during which they periodically visit Pakistan for short or long breaks, and finally return permanently. Overseas Pakistanis are the second largest source of foreign exchange remittances to Pakistan after exports and over the last several years, foreign exchange remittances have maintained a steady rising trend. {{PKRConvert|670|b}} in 2007\u201308,{{PKRConvert|817|b}} in 2008-09 and {{PKRConvert|985|b}} in 2009\u201310.<ref name=\"worldbank.org\"/> By 2012\u201313, remittances stood at {{PKRConvert|1362|b}}.<ref name=\"mohammad\"/><ref name=\"worldbank.org\"/> In 2014\u201315, overseas Pakistanis sent remittances amounting to {{PKRConvert|1928|b}}.<ref name=\"Pakistanis remittances\"/><ref name=\"mohammad\"/><ref name=\"worldbank.org\"/><ref name=\"dawn.com\"/> Since 2004, the Government of Pakistan has recognised the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the national [[Economy of Pakistan|economy]].

Unlike European immigrants who settled permanently in the new world, many Pakistanis who emigrated considered themselves to be \"sojourners\", who left to earn money abroad but not to settle, or were students who intended to return to Pakistan when their degree programs were completed.\n\n===Little Pakistan===\n{{main|Little Pakistan}}\n''Little Pakistan'' is a general name for an [[ethnic enclave]] populated primarily by [[Pakistanis]] or people of Pakistani ancestry abroad.\n\n===Pakistan International School===\n{{main|Pakistan International School}}\n''Pakistan International Schools'' are [[school]]s based outside [[Pakistan]] which promote the national curriculum.

However, since the 1990s, many of them have opted for countries like the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Kuwait]]. Pakistanis who emigrated to these countries or who were born in these countries tended to stay close to Pakistani culture. Many \"International Pakistan Schools\" were opened to cater for the large population and for them to study under the same boards as Pakistani students at home. As a result, those returning to Pakistan from the Middle East have found it much easier to adjust. Pakistanis from the Middle East can be found throughout the country today and these people are usually fluent in [[Urdu]], [[English language|English]] and their regional language. They are most likely involved in [[Trade|trading]], [[Mass media|media]], [[telecommunications]], [[banking]], and [[aviation]].\n\n===From Europe===\n{{Main|Britons in Pakistan}}\nSince the 1990s, a large number of Pakistanis who settled in Europe have been returning to Pakistan. Those who were born in Europe have also maintained close links to Pakistani culture. However, there are some instances of children not learning [[Urdu]] while growing up or being accustomed to Pakistani culture. As a result, those who return from Europe do experience \"culture shocks\". Those returning from [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] are mostly settled around [[Kharian]] in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province, whereas those from northern [[England]] ([[Bradford]]) can be found in [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] (mainly [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]]), [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and upper [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] ([[Jhelum]], [[Chakwal]], [[Attock]] and [[Rawalpindi]]).\n\n===From America===\n{{Main|Americans in Pakistan|Canadians in Pakistan}}\nVery small numbers of Pakistanis from [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have historically returned to Pakistan. Although they frequently visit Pakistan during the summer and winter vacations, permanent settlement had not been popular amongst them until 2001. Since the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] and the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]], a large number of [[Pakistani Americans]] and [[Pakistani Canadians]] have begun to return. The population of returning expatriates from the Americas, who tend to have excellent credentials, has increased significantly due to new job opportunities in Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7490555.stm | work=BBC News | title=Returning Pakistanis praise new lives | date=2008-07-06 | accessdate=2010-05-21 | first=Karishma | last=Vaswani}}</ref> Many from North America are found in the major cities of Pakistan, mainly  [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]], [[Faisalabad]] and [[Peshawar]]. Large populations can also be found in smaller cities and towns, such as [[Sialkot]].

The rapid industrialisation process of Pakistan during the 1950s and 1960s coupled with the introduction of modern agricultural practices pushed out surplus labour leading to mass rural to urban migration, primarily to [[Karachi]].<ref>Sir Rupert Hay, the Persian Gulf States, Middle East Institute, Washington DC, 1959; International Labour Organization, 1945-1957, Geneva, 1959; Quoted in Addleton, 1992</ref> During this time period, the majority of Pakistanis who went abroad considered themselves to be \"sojourners\", who left to earn money abroad but not to settle, or were students who intended to return to Pakistan when their degree programs were completed. By 1971, no more than 900,000 Pakistanis lived abroad with the majority residing in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. In 1959, small numbers of Pakistanis were found to be working in Bahrain, Kuwait and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. By 1960, the Pakistani community in Bahrain numbered 2,200 while almost half of the population in Kuwait comprised non-nationals, and of them a small number came from Pakistan. Pakistan was already the single most important source of non-Arab expatriate labour in the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] (representing about 19% of the workforce) and trailed only Americans among those working for [[Saudi Aramco]] in Saudi Arabia, who represented 6% of the workforce.<ref>Albert Y. Badre and Simon G Siksek, Manpower and Oil in the Arab Countries, Economic Research Institute,\nAmerican University of Beirut, 1960.</ref>\n\nThe first mass migration of Pakistanis began in 1965 during the construction of [[Mangla Dam]] in [[Azad Kashmir|Azad Jammu & Kashmir]]. Over 280 villages around [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Dadyal]] were submerged, which lead to the displacement of over 110,000 people from the region. During the same period, the UK Government were actively seeking people from abroad to work in industrial towns in north-west [[England]] who were suffering from labour shortages. Thus many worker permits for the UK were awarded to the displaced population of Mirpur who were eligible for work.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil \"Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges\", Indiana University, 2013, available at: http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/8833?show=full</ref> Close to 50,000 Pakistanis from Mirpur emigrated to Northern England between 1965-1970.<ref name=eng>{{cite web|title=The Pakistani Muslim Community in England|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1170952.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http:/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1170952.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-19}}</ref><ref name=\"ons.gov.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations/kashmiri-research-project-2011---final-report.pdf |title=2011 Census Branding Approval Form |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n====1971 to present====\n\nThe availability of large scale labour force from Pakistan owed to a combination of socioeconomic and institutional factors at home. By 1970, Pakistan was passing through a serious economic and political crisis which eventually led to the secession of [[East Pakistan]] in 1971. The rapid economic development of the 1950s and 1960s could not be sustained by 1970 and a wave of nationalisation of business and\nindustry was unfolding under Prime Minister [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. This led to slower large scale industrialisation due to a new wave of industrial unrest and disaffection between industrialists and Bhutto's government which favored nationalisation of banking, large scale trading and industry. Rural to urban migration into Karachi slowed down during the 1970s and 1980s and was substituted by a rising wave of international migration to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Libya. The profile of the work force and their places of origin simply followed the established patterns internal migration routes. These included people from [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20132010)|NWFP]], northern Punjab (Potohar Plateau), the \"Seraiki belt\" in southern Punjab and the hill-tracts of Azad Jammu & Kashmir. Institutionally, a network of information chains to seek work, and the channels for remitting money to families back in Pakistan had already existed. The majority of migrants were young males who would seek work abroad while families would remain back in Pakistan. These channels soon expanded and adapted themselves to new requirements and conditions.<ref>Roger Owen, Migrant Workers in the Gulf, London; Minority Rights Group Report Number 68, September 1985.</ref> During the 1960s and 1970s, the remaining [[Pakistani Jew]]ish community of 2000 began emigrating to [[Israel]] and settled in [[Ramla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishtimesasia.org/community-spotlight-topmenu-43/pakistan/544-pakistan-communities/2806-a-jewish-presence-in-pakistan-karachi-in-another-time|title=A Jewish presence in Pakistan \u2013 Karachi in another time|first=Philip|last=Jay|website=www.jewishtimesasia.org|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday over 8,800,000 Pakistanis live abroad, with an estimated 4,000,000 Pakistanis in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.

Workers come in, work for a few years during which they periodically visit Pakistan for short or long breaks, and finally return permanently.

The head office of the OPF school is located in [[Islamabad]], administering the system through Six main regional offices:\n* Regional Office Karachi, Sindh (ROK)- [[Karachi|Karachi Metropolitan Area]] and [[Sindh]]\n* Regional Office Lahore, Punjab (ROL) - [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]\n* Regional Office Multan, Punjab (ROM) - some divisions of Punjab under ROM like [[Multan]], [[Bahawalpur]], [[Dera Ghazi Khan]]\n* Regional Office Northern Areas, Mirpur (AJK)  - [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]]\n* Regional Office Peshawar, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (ROP) - [[Khyber Pakthunkhwa]]\n* Regional Office Quetta,  Balochistan (ROQ) - [[Balochistan]]\n\n==Relations with Pakistan==\nMillions of Pakistanis emigrated to various countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Unlike European immigrants who settled permanently in the new world, many Pakistanis who emigrated considered themselves to be \"sojourners\", who left to earn money abroad but not to settle, or were students who intended to return to Pakistan when their degree programs were completed.\n\n===Little Pakistan===\n{{main|Little Pakistan}}\n''Little Pakistan'' is a general name for an [[ethnic enclave]] populated primarily by [[Pakistanis]] or people of Pakistani ancestry abroad.\n\n===Pakistan International School===\n{{main|Pakistan International School}}\n''Pakistan International Schools'' are [[school]]s based outside [[Pakistan]] which promote the national curriculum. These schools fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education]] and cater mainly to students who are not nationals of the host country such as the children of the staff of [[international business]]es, international organizations, embassies, missions, or missionary programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pisj-es.com/npisj/pages/about/|title=pisj-es.com|website=pisj-es.com}}</ref> \n\nFor [[overseas Pakistanis|overseas Pakistani]] families, these schools allow continuity in education from Pakistan as most prefer to stay in the same curriculum, especially for older children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pisjubail.com/|title=Official Website of Pakistan International School Al-Jubail, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|website=www.pisjubail.com}}</ref> Pakistan international schools typically use curricula based on the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education and offer both [[Urdu language]] and [[English language]] classes.\n\n===From the Middle East===\n{{Main|Arabs in Pakistan}}\nSince the independence of Pakistan in 1947, there has been a large population of Pakistanis in the Middle East, mainly in [[Saudi Arabia]]. However, since the 1990s, many of them have opted for countries like the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Kuwait]]. Pakistanis who emigrated to these countries or who were born in these countries tended to stay close to Pakistani culture. Many \"International Pakistan Schools\" were opened to cater for the large population and for them to study under the same boards as Pakistani students at home. As a result, those returning to Pakistan from the Middle East have found it much easier to adjust. Pakistanis from the Middle East can be found throughout the country today and these people are usually fluent in [[Urdu]], [[English language|English]] and their regional language. They are most likely involved in [[Trade|trading]], [[Mass media|media]], [[telecommunications]], [[banking]], and [[aviation]].\n\n===From Europe===\n{{Main|Britons in Pakistan}}\nSince the 1990s, a large number of Pakistanis who settled in Europe have been returning to Pakistan. Those who were born in Europe have also maintained close links to Pakistani culture. However, there are some instances of children not learning [[Urdu]] while growing up or being accustomed to Pakistani culture. As a result, those who return from Europe do experience \"culture shocks\". Those returning from [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] are mostly settled around [[Kharian]] in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province, whereas those from northern [[England]] ([[Bradford]]) can be found in [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] (mainly [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]]), [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and upper [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] ([[Jhelum]], [[Chakwal]], [[Attock]] and [[Rawalpindi]]).\n\n===From America===\n{{Main|Americans in Pakistan|Canadians in Pakistan}}\nVery small numbers of Pakistanis from [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have historically returned to Pakistan. Although they frequently visit Pakistan during the summer and winter vacations, permanent settlement had not been popular amongst them until 2001. Since the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] and the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]], a large number of [[Pakistani Americans]] and [[Pakistani Canadians]] have begun to return. The population of returning expatriates from the Americas, who tend to have excellent credentials, has increased significantly due to new job opportunities in Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7490555.stm | work=BBC News | title=Returning Pakistanis praise new lives | date=2008-07-06 | accessdate=2010-05-21 | first=Karishma | last=Vaswani}}</ref> Many from North America are found in the major cities of Pakistan, mainly  [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]], [[Faisalabad]] and [[Peshawar]]. Large populations can also be found in smaller cities and towns, such as [[Sialkot]]. Those returning from North America have tended to find jobs easier in Pakistan and are involved in a wide scope of fields, primarily [[healthcare]], [[engineering]], [[law]], [[banking]], [[information technology]], [[mass media]] and [[industry]].\n\n===Remittances===\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Remittances sent by year ($US billion) <ref name=\"Pakistanis remittances\">{{cite
