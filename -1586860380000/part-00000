They play their home games at the Bradford Ice Arena, [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]]. They were formed in 2005.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThe Bradford Sabres are the ice hockey team for the [[University of Bradford]] and are run and funded by the [[University of Bradford Union]]. The club began in 2005 when a number of students decided that there should be an ice hockey club at the university. The early sessions consisted of only a handful of players, almost all of whom had no previous experience playing hockey. With the sessions being run by captain Mike Currie with the help of experienced netminder Kaz Matsumoto, the players started to gain some experience and it was decided that the club would enter into the British Universities Ice Hockey Association, Division 2 North cup competition.\n\n== Seasons ==\n\n=== 2005\u20132006 ===\n\n[[File:Sabres at Sheffield.jpg|thumb|right|Sabres at their first match at Sheffield]]\n\nAlthough the team was gaining more experience, numbers were still very low until the in-take of freshers at the beginning of the 2005-2006 season. Amongst these were not only a large number of beginners, but also several players with previous experience, most notably Jan Kucera and Tim Kelly. The team's very first game was away against the [[Sheffied Bears]] where although they were beaten 7-0, there were several outstanding performances. Netminder Kaz Matsumoto was awarded man of the match having faced over 70 shots and there was also a superb performance by defender Tim Kelly who was on the ice for 56 of the 60 minutes played.\n\nThe Sabres first home game showed a marked improvement from their loss at Sheffield. Even though they were defeated 6-9 by the [[Birmingham Eagles]] proving that the team could score goals was a major boost. Making his debut in this match was Czech Republic born Jan Kucera who introduced himself to university hockey by scoring all six of the Sabres goals and deservedly winning his first Man of the Match award.\n\nThe Sabres first win came in their next game against the [[Newcastle Wildcats]]. This was the first of many very close and enjoyable games between the two teams. The Sabres won, 6-5. Once again Jan Kucera scored all six for the Sabres, and after only two matches for the club, he was already being recognised as the best player in the division. Man of the Match in this game was rookie netminder Stephen Wilson, playing the second thirty minutes and helping the team to hold on for their first victory.\n\nHowever, that was the only victory the team had in their debut season, and they finished bottom of the division of seven teams. Another moment of note that season was away at Newcastle. The team were down 3-0 at the end of the first period, and looked out of the game. In the second period Jan Kucera scored a hat-trick in under one minute, scoring the first from open play, and the next two by winning the face-off and scoring un-assisted. The team lost the match 4-3, but the game still is still much talked about because of the hat-trick. The team were due to compete in their first ever national championships in April, where teams from both the north and south divisions competed over a weekend in a cup competition. However, due to administration complications not only were the team not allowed to compete, but they were also disqualified from the league, and their final position of seventh did not count. Although the games that were played didn't officially count, the experience the team gained was valuable for next season and for the continued growth of the club.\n\nThe end of the Sabres first season saw the departure of some key players. Jan Kucera - who still holds the record for goals scored - took the step up to the [[English National Ice Hockey League]] to play for the [[Bradford Bulldogs]]. Forward Ben Moss along with defenders Toni Brook and Louisa Bellis also departed the team after completing their final year at the university.\n\nOff the ice there were also changes. President Ben Nunney along with treasurer Ben Neal left the university and their positions were taken over by Hassan Majeed and James Davidson while web officer Mike Currie continued with his role and Stephen Wilson took over the newly created position of fixtures Secretary.\n\n== Players of note ==\n\n=== Executive committee ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With the sessions being run by captain Mike Currie with the help of experienced netminder Kaz Matsumoto, the players started to gain some experience and it was decided that the club would enter into the British Universities Ice Hockey Association, Division 2 North cup competition.\n\n== Seasons ==\n\n=== 2005\u20132006 ===\n\n[[File:Sabres at Sheffield.jpg|thumb|right|Sabres at their first match at Sheffield]]\n\nAlthough the team was gaining more experience, numbers were still very low until the in-take of freshers at the beginning of the 2005-2006 season. Amongst these were not only a large number of beginners, but also several players with previous experience, most notably Jan Kucera and Tim Kelly. The teams very first game was away against the [[Sheffied Bears]] where although they were beaten 7-0, there were several outstanding performances. Netminder Kaz Matsumoto was awarded man of the match having faced over 70 shots and there was also a superb performance by defender Tim Kelly who was on the ice for 56 of the 60 minutes played.\n\nThe Sabres first home game showed a marked improvement from their loss at Sheffield. Even though they were defeated 6-9 by the [[Birmingham Eagles]] proving that the team could score goals was a major boost. Making his debut in this match was Czech Republic born Jan Kucera who introduced himself to university hockey by scoring all six of the Sabres goals and deservedly winning his first Man of the Match award.\n\nThe Sabres first win came in their next game against the [[Newcastle Wildcats]]. This was the first of many very close and enjoyable games between the two teams. The Sabres won, 6-5. Once again Jan Kucera scored all six for the Sabres, and after only two matches for the club, he was already being recognised as the best player in the division. Man of the Match in this game was rookie netminder Stephen Wilson, playing the second thirty minutes and helping the team to hold on for their first victory.\n\nHowever, that was the only victory the team had in their debut season, and they finished bottom of the division of seven teams. Another moment of note that season was away at Newcastle. The team were down 3-0 at the end of the first period, and looked out of the game. In the second period Jan Kucera scored a hat-trick in under one minute, scoring the first from open play, and the next two by winning the face-off and scoring un-assisted. The team lost the match 4-3, but the game still is still much talked about because of the hat-trick. The team were due to compete in their first ever national championships in April, where teams from both the north and south divisions competed over a weekend in a cup competition. However, due to administration complications not only were the team not allowed to compete, but they were also disqualified from the league, and their final position of seventh did not count. Although the games that were played didn't officially count, the experience the team gained was valuable for next season and for the continued growth of the club.\n\nThe end of the Sabres first season saw the departure of some key players. Jan Kucera - who still holds the record for goals scored - took the step up to the [[English National Ice Hockey League]] to play for the [[Bradford Bulldogs]]. Forward Ben Moss along with defenders Toni Brook and Louisa Bellis also departed the team after completing their final year at the university.\n\nOff the ice there were also changes. President Ben Nunney along with treasurer Ben Neal left the university and their positions were taken over by Hassan Majeed and James Davidson while web officer Mike Currie continued with his role and Stephen Wilson took over the newly created position of fixtures Secretary.\n\n== Players of note ==\n\n=== Executive committee ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The question whether the Cape Verde kite should be considered a distinct [[species]] (''Milvus fasciicauda'') or a red kite subspecies has not been settled. A [[mitochondrial DNA]] study on museum specimens suggested that Cape Verde birds did not form a [[monophyletic]] lineage among or next to red kites.<ref name=Johnson/> This interpretation is problematic: mtDNA analysis is susceptible to hybridization events, the evolutionary history of the Cape Verde population is not known, and the [[Genetics|genetic]] relationship of red kites is confusing, with geographical proximity being no indicator of genetic relatedness and the overall genetic similarity high,<ref name=Schreiber2000/> perhaps indicating a [[Relict (biology)|relict]] species. Given the morphological distinctness of the Cape Verde birds and that the Cape Verde population was isolated from other populations of red kites, it cannot be conclusively resolved as to whether the Cape Verde population was not a distinct subspecies (as ''M. migrans fasciicauda'') or even species that frequently absorbed stragglers from the migrating European populations into its gene pool. The Cape Verde population became effectively [[extinct]] since 2000, all surviving birds being hybrids with [[black kite]]s.<ref name=Johnson/>\n\nThe English word \"kite\" is from the [[Old English]] ''cyta'' which is of unknown origin. A kite is mentioned by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s in his ''[[The Knight's Tale|Knight's Tale]]''. The early fifteenth century [[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt manuscript]] contains the lines: \"Ther cam a kyte, whil \u00fet they were so wrothe That bar awey the boon bitwix hem bothe.\" The first recorded use of the word \"kite\" for a toy that is attached to a length of string and flown in the air dates from the seventeenth century.<ref>{{Cite OED | kite |id=103752 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:White Red Kite in Flight - geograph.org.uk - 687770.jpg|thumb|right|Leucistic form]]\n[[File:Red Kite (Milvus milvus) skull at the Royal Veterinary College anatomy museum.JPG|thumb|A red kite skull]]\nRed kites are {{convert|60|to|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} long<ref name=Campbell2000/> with a {{convert|175|-|179|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan; males weigh {{convert|800|-|1200|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and females {{convert|1000|-|1300|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bwpc/> It is an elegant bird, soaring on long wings held at a [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], and long forked tail, twisting as it changes direction. The body, upper tail and [[covert feather#wing coverts|wing coverts]] are [[rufous]]. The white primary flight feathers contrast with the black wing tips and dark secondaries.

For migrant populations the fidelity to a particular nesting site means that the pair-bond is likely to be renewed each breeding season.{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=40}} The nest is normally placed in a fork of a large hardwood tree at a height of between {{cvt|12|and|15|m}} above the ground. A pair will sometimes use a nest from the previous year and can occasionally occupy an old nest of the [[common buzzard]].{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=42}} The nest is built by both sexes. The male brings dead twigs {{cvt|30|-|50|cm}} in length which are placed by the female. The nest is lined with grass and sometimes also with sheep's wool. Unlike the black kite, no greenery is added to the nest. Both sexes continue to add material to the nest during the incubation and nestling periods. Nests vary greatly in size and can become large when the same nest is occupied for several seasons.{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=43}}\n\nThe eggs are laid at three-day intervals. The [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is usually between one and three eggs but 4 and even 5 eggs have occasionally been recorded. The eggs are non-glossy with a white ground and red-brown spots. The average size is {{cvt|57|x|45|mm}} with a calculated weight of {{cvt|63|g}}.{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=43}} In Britain and in central Europe laying begins at the end of March but in the Mediterranean area laying begins in early March.{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=42}} The eggs are mainly incubated by the female, but the male will relieve her for short periods while she feeds. The male will also bring food for the female. Incubation starts as soon as the first egg is laid. Each egg hatches after 31 to 32 days but as they hatch asynchronously a clutch of three eggs requires 38 days of incubation. The chicks are cared for by both parents. The female {{Birdgloss|brood|broods}} them for the first 14 days while the male brings food to the nest which the female feeds to the chicks. Later both parents bring items of food which are placed in the nest to allow the chicks to feed themselves. The nestlings begin climbing onto branches around their nest from 45 days but they rarely {{Birdgloss|fledge}} before 48-50 days and sometimes not until they are 60-70 days of age. The young spend a further 15-20 days in the neighbourhood of the nest being fed by their parents.

One such occurrence took place in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Buckinghamshire]] (a town near a major reintroduction site for the species in the UK in the nearby village of [[Stokenchurch]]), in which Red Kites swooped down to steal sandwiches from people in one of the town's parks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trivedi |first1=Shruti |title=Fresh warning over red kite 'attacks' in Higginson Park, Marlow |url=https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/16190370.Fresh_warning_over_red_kite____attacks____in_popular_park/ |website=[[Bucks Free Press]] Online |publisher=[[Bucks Free Press]] |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and status==\n[[File:Red Kite, Spain.jpg|thumb|right|Red kite in flight in Gredos Mountains, Avila, Spain]]\nRed kites inhabit broadleaf woodlands, valleys and wetland edges, to {{convert|800|m|ft}}. They are native to the western [[Palearctic]], with the European population of 19,000\u201325,000 pairs encompassing 95% of its global breeding range. It breeds from Spain and Portugal east into central Europe and [[Ukraine]], north to southern Sweden, [[Latvia]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and south to southern Italy. There is a population in northern [[Morocco]]. Northern birds move south in winter, mostly staying in the west of the breeding range, but also to eastern [[Turkey]], northern [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. The three largest populations (in Germany, France and Spain, which together hold more than 75% of the global population) declined between 1990 and 2000, and overall the species declined by almost 20% over the ten years. The main threats to red kites are poisoning, through illegal direct poisoning and indirect poisoning from pesticides, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, and changes in agricultural practices causing a reduction in food resources. Other threats include electrocution, hunting and trapping, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) and possibly competition with the generally more successful black kite ''M. migrans''.<ref name=IUCN/>\n\n===Continental Europe===\n[[File:P6150074.JPG|thumb|Nestling red kites, [[Barnim]], Germany]]\nGerman populations declined by 25%\u201330% between 1991 and 1997, but have remained stable since. The populations of the northern foothills of the [[Harz Mountains]] (the most densely populated part of its range) suffered an estimated 50% decline from 1991 to 2001. In Spain, the species showed an overall decline in breeding population of up to 43% for the period 1994 to 2001\u201302, and surveys of wintering birds in 2003\u201304 suggest a similarly large decline in core wintering areas. The [[Balearic Island]]s population has declined from 41\u201347 breeding pairs in 1993 to just 10 in 2003. In France, breeding populations have decreased in the northeast, but seem to be stable in southwest and central France and [[Corsica]]. Populations elsewhere are stable or undergoing increases. In Sweden, the species has increased from 30\u201350 pairs in the 1970s to 1,200 breeding pairs in 2003. In Switzerland, populations increased during the 1990s, and have stabilised.<ref name=IUCN/> According to a report by the Welsh Kite Trust, the UK is the only country in which the red kite population is increasing. Red kites are decreasing in their strongholds of Spain, France and Germany.<ref name=WelshKiteTrust/>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Red Kite - Gigrin Farm Wales (10489884433).jpg|thumb|Red kite, Gigrin Farm, Wales]]\n[[File:Kites at the table. - geograph.org.uk - 582274.jpg|thumb|Red kites at the feeding station, [[Laurieston, Dumfries and Galloway|Laurieston]], [[Scotland]].]]\nIn the United Kingdom, red kites were ubiquitous scavengers that lived on carrion and rubbish. Shakespeare's [[King Lear]] describes his daughter [[Goneril]] as a ''detested kite'', and he wrote \"when the kite builds, look to your lesser linen\" in reference to them stealing washing hung out to dry in the nesting season.<ref name=Radio4/> In the mid-15th century, [[King James II of Scotland]] decreed that they should be \"killed wherever possible\", but they remained protected in England and Wales for the next 100 years as they kept the streets free of carrion and rotting food.<ref name=NewKay/> Under Tudor \"vermin laws\" many creatures were seen as competitors for the produce of the countryside and bounties were paid by the parish for their carcasses.<ref name=McCarthy2007/>\n\nBy the 20th century, the breeding population was restricted to a handful of pairs in [[South Wales]], but recently the Welsh population has been supplemented by re-introductions in England and Scotland. In 2004, from 375 occupied territories identified, at least 216 pairs were thought to have hatched eggs and 200 pairs reared at least 286 young.<ref name=IUCN/> In 1989, six Swedish birds were released at a site in north Scotland and four Swedish and a Welsh bird in [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref name=\"RSPB conservation\"/> Altogether, 93 birds of Swedish and Spanish origin were released at each of the sites. In the second stage of reintroduction in 1995 and 1996, further birds were brought from Germany to populate areas of [[Dumfries and Galloway]]. Ninety-four birds were brought from the Chilterns and introduced into the [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent Valley]] in North East England between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"RSPB conservation\"/> In Northern Ireland, 80 birds from wild stock in Wales were released over three years between 2008 and 2010, and in 2010 the first successful breeding was recorded. The reintroductions in [[the Chilterns]] have been a success. Between 1989 and 1993, 90 birds were released in the Chilterns [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and by 2002, 139 pairs were breeding there.<ref name=Chilterns/> They can commonly be seen taking advantage of thermals from the [[M40 motorway]].<ref name=McCarthy2/> Another successful reintroduction has been in [[Northamptonshire]], which has become a stronghold for the red kite.<ref name=birdguides/> Thirty Spanish birds were introduced into [[Rockingham Forest]] near [[Corby]] in 2000,<ref name=northantset/> and by 2010, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB]] estimated that over 200 chicks had been reared from the initial release. So successful has the reintroduction been that 30 chicks have been transported from Rockingham Forest, for release in [[Cumbria]].<ref name=BBC/>\n\nA sighting of the first red kite in London for 150 years was reported in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper in January 2006<ref name=McCarthy2006/> and in June of that year, the UK-based Northern Kites Project reported that kites had bred in the Derwent Valley in and around [[Rowlands Gill]], [[Tyne and Wear]] for the first time since the re-introduction.<ref name=BBC2006/>\n\nIn 1999, the red kite was named 'Bird of the Century' by the [[British Trust for Ornithology]].<ref name=Radio4/> According to the Welsh Kite Trust, it has been voted \"Wales's favourite bird\".<ref name=WalesFavBird/>\n\nIn June 2010, the [[Forestry Commission]] North West England announced a three-year project to release 90 red kites in [[Grizedale Forest]], [[Cumbria]] under a special licence issued by [[Natural England]]. The Grizedale programme was be the ninth reintroduction of red kites into different regions of the UK and the final re-introduction phase in England.<ref name=WestmorlandGazette/>\n\nThe stated aims of the Grizedale project were:\n* To establish a viable population of red kites in Grizedale, South Cumbria by 2015.\n* To increase the rate of red kite expansion into North West England and link up with existing populations in Wales, Yorkshire, North East England and South West Scotland and so increase the chances of a continuous geographical range.\n* To develop community involvement and create educational opportunities arising from the project.<ref name=\"FC Poster\"/>\n\nAs of July 2011, non-breeding birds are regularly seen in all parts of Britain, and the number of breeding pairs is too large for the RSPB to continue to survey them on an annual basis.<ref name=rspb2/>\n\n===Ireland===\nRed kites were extinct in Ireland by the middle nineteenth century, due to persecution, poisoning and woodland clearance. In May 2007, [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[Dick Roche]] announced an agreement to bring at least 100 birds from Wales to restock the population as part of a 5-year programme in the [[Wicklow Mountains]], similar to the earlier [[golden eagle]] reintroduction programme.<ref name=NDP/> On 19 July 2007, the first thirty red kites were released in [[County Wicklow]].<ref name=environ.ie/><ref name=wildlifeextra/> On 22 May 2010, 2 newly hatched red kite chicks were discovered in the [[County Wicklow|Wicklow mountains]],<ref name=Melia2010/> bringing the number of chicks hatched since reintroduction to 7.<ref name=goldeneagle/>\n\n===Sweden===\nSweden is one location where the red kite seems to be increasing, with around 2000 pairs in 2009, some of which are overwintering and some flying south to the Mediterranean for the winter. They return around March\u2013April. The red kite is the landscape bird of [[Scania]], and the coat of arms of the municipality of [[Tomelilla]].

[[Vagrancy (biology)|Vagrants]] have reached north to [[Finland]] and south to [[palestine]] and [[Israel]], [[Libya]] and [[Gambia]].<ref name=bwpc/><ref name=Gambia/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red kite was described by the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' under the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Falco milvus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> The word ''milvus'' was the [[Latin]] name for the bird.<ref name=Jobling/> In 1799 the French naturalist [[Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de]] moved the species to the [[genus]] ''Milvus'' creating the [[tautonym]].<ref name=Lacepede/>\n\nTwo [[subspecies]] are recognised:<ref name=ioc>{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2018 | title=New World vultures, Secretarybird, kites, hawks, eagles | work=World Bird List Version 8.2 | url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/raptors/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=24 September 2018 }}</ref>\n* ''M. m. milvus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) \u2013 Europe and northwest Africa to the Middle East\n* ''M. m. fasciicauda'' [[Ernst Hartert|Hartert]], 1914 \u2013 [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]\n\nThe subspecies ''M. m. fasciicauda'' is almost certainly extinct.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1=Hille | first1=Sabine M. | last2=Collar | first2=Nigel J. | year=2009 | title=The taxonomic and conservation status of ''Milvus'' kites in the Cape Verde archipelago: further (and final?) reflections | journal=Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club | volume=129 | issue=4 | pages=217\u2013221 | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/47491083 }}</ref>\n\nThe genus ''Milvus'' contains two other species: the [[black kite]] (''M. migrans'') and the [[yellow-billed kite]] (''M. aegyptius'').<ref name=ioc/> The red kite has been known to successfully [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with the black kite in captivity where both species were kept together, and in the wild on the Cape Verde Islands and infrequently in other places.<ref name=Hille2000/> The red kites on the Cape Verde Islands are (or rather were) quite distinct in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], being somewhat intermediate with black kites. The question whether the Cape Verde kite should be considered a distinct [[species]] (''Milvus fasciicauda'') or a red kite subspecies has not been settled. A [[mitochondrial DNA]] study on museum specimens suggested that Cape Verde birds did not form a [[monophyletic]] lineage among or next to red kites.<ref name=Johnson/> This interpretation is problematic: mtDNA analysis is susceptible to hybridization events, the evolutionary history of the Cape Verde population is not known, and the [[Genetics|genetic]] relationship of red kites is confusing, with geographical proximity being no indicator of genetic relatedness and the overall genetic similarity high,<ref name=Schreiber2000/> perhaps indicating a [[Relict (biology)|relict]] species. Given the morphological distinctness of the Cape Verde birds and that the Cape Verde population was isolated from other populations of red kites, it cannot be conclusively resolved as to whether the Cape Verde population was not a distinct subspecies (as ''M. migrans fasciicauda'') or even species that frequently absorbed stragglers from the migrating European populations into its gene pool. The Cape Verde population became effectively [[extinct]] since 2000, all surviving birds being hybrids with [[black kite]]s.<ref name=Johnson/>\n\nThe English word \"kite\" is from the [[Old English]] ''cyta'' which is of unknown origin. A kite is mentioned by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s in his ''[[The Knight's Tale|Knight's Tale]]''. The early fifteenth century [[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt manuscript]] contains the lines: \"Ther cam a kyte, whil \u00fet they were so wrothe That bar awey the boon bitwix hem bothe.\" The first recorded use of the word \"kite\" for a toy that is attached to a length of string and flown in the air dates from the seventeenth century.<ref>{{Cite OED | kite |id=103752 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:White Red Kite in Flight - geograph.org.uk - 687770.jpg|thumb|right|Leucistic form]]\n[[File:Red Kite (Milvus milvus) skull at the Royal Veterinary College anatomy museum.JPG|thumb|A red kite skull]]\nRed kites are {{convert|60|to|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} long<ref name=Campbell2000/> with a {{convert|175|-|179|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan; males weigh {{convert|800|-|1200|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and females {{convert|1000|-|1300|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bwpc/> It is an elegant bird, soaring on long wings held at a [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], and long forked tail, twisting as it changes direction. The body, upper tail and [[covert feather#wing coverts|wing coverts]] are [[rufous]]. The white primary flight feathers contrast with the black wing tips and dark secondaries. Apart from the weight difference, the sexes are similar, but juveniles have a buff breast and belly. Its call is a thin piping sound, similar to but less mewling than the [[common buzzard]].

A pair will sometimes use a nest from the previous year and can occasionally occupy an old nest of the [[common buzzard]].{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=42}} The nest is built by both sexes. The male brings dead twigs {{cvt|30|-|50|cm}} in length which are placed by the female. The nest is lined with grass and sometimes also with sheep's wool. Unlike the black kite, no greenery is added to the nest. Both sexes continue to add material to the nest during the incubation and nestling periods. Nests vary greatly in size and can become large when the same nest is occupied for several seasons.{{sfn|Cramp|1980|p=43}}\n\nThe eggs are laid at three-day intervals. The [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is usually between one and three eggs but 4 and even 5 eggs have occasionally been recorded. The eggs are non-glossy with a white ground and red-brown spots.

The male will also bring food for the female. Incubation starts as soon as the first egg is laid. Each egg hatches after 31 to 32 days but as they hatch asynchronously a clutch of three eggs requires 38 days of incubation. The chicks are cared for by both parents. The female {{Birdgloss|brood|broods}} them for the first 14 days while the male brings food to the nest which the female feeds to the chicks. Later both parents bring items of food which are placed in the nest to allow the chicks to feed themselves. The nestlings begin climbing onto branches around their nest from 45 days but they rarely {{Birdgloss|fledge}} before 48-50 days and sometimes not until they are 60-70 days of age. The young spend a further 15-20 days in the neighbourhood of the nest being fed by their parents.

One such occurrence took place in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Buckinghamshire]] (a town near a major reintroduction site for the species in the UK in the nearby village of [[Stokenchurch]]), in which Red Kites swooped down to steal sandwiches from people in one of the town's parks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trivedi |first1=Shruti |title=Fresh warning over red kite 'attacks' in Higginson Park, Marlow |url=https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/16190370.Fresh_warning_over_red_kite____attacks____in_popular_park/ |website=[[Bucks Free Press]] Online |publisher=[[Bucks Free Press]] |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and status==\n[[File:Red Kite, Spain.jpg|thumb|right|Red kite in flight in Gredos Mountains, Avila, Spain]]\nRed kites inhabit broadleaf woodlands, valleys and wetland edges, to {{convert|800|m|ft}}. They are native to the western [[Palearctic]], with the European population of 19,000\u201325,000 pairs encompassing 95% of its global breeding range. It breeds from Spain and Portugal east into central Europe and [[Ukraine]], north to southern Sweden, [[Latvia]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and south to southern Italy. There is a population in northern [[Morocco]]. Northern birds move south in winter, mostly staying in the west of the breeding range, but also to eastern [[Turkey]], northern [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. The three largest populations (in Germany, France and Spain, which together hold more than 75% of the global population) declined between 1990 and 2000, and overall the species declined by almost 20% over the ten years. The main threats to red kites are poisoning, through illegal direct poisoning and indirect poisoning from pesticides, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, and changes in agricultural practices causing a reduction in food resources. Other threats include electrocution, hunting and trapping, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) and possibly competition with the generally more successful black kite ''M. migrans''.<ref name=IUCN/>\n\n===Continental Europe===\n[[File:P6150074.JPG|thumb|Nestling red kites, [[Barnim]], Germany]]\nGerman populations declined by 25%\u201330% between 1991 and 1997, but have remained stable since. The populations of the northern foothills of the [[Harz Mountains]] (the most densely populated part of its range) suffered an estimated 50% decline from 1991 to 2001. In Spain, the species showed an overall decline in breeding population of up to 43% for the period 1994 to 2001\u201302, and surveys of wintering birds in 2003\u201304 suggest a similarly large decline in core wintering areas. The [[Balearic Island]]s population has declined from 41\u201347 breeding pairs in 1993 to just 10 in 2003. In France, breeding populations have decreased in the northeast, but seem to be stable in southwest and central France and [[Corsica]]. Populations elsewhere are stable or undergoing increases. In Sweden, the species has increased from 30\u201350 pairs in the 1970s to 1,200 breeding pairs in 2003. In Switzerland, populations increased during the 1990s, and have stabilised.<ref name=IUCN/> According to a report by the Welsh Kite Trust, the UK is the only country in which the red kite population is increasing. Red kites are decreasing in their strongholds of Spain, France and Germany.<ref name=WelshKiteTrust/>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Red Kite - Gigrin Farm Wales (10489884433).jpg|thumb|Red kite, Gigrin Farm, Wales]]\n[[File:Kites at the table. - geograph.org.uk - 582274.jpg|thumb|Red kites at the feeding station, [[Laurieston, Dumfries and Galloway|Laurieston]], [[Scotland]].]]\nIn the United Kingdom, red kites were ubiquitous scavengers that lived on carrion and rubbish. Shakespeare's [[King Lear]] describes his daughter [[Goneril]] as a ''detested kite'', and he wrote \"when the kite builds, look to your lesser linen\" in reference to them stealing washing hung out to dry in the nesting season.<ref name=Radio4/> In the mid-15th century, [[King James II of Scotland]] decreed that they should be \"killed wherever possible\", but they remained protected in England and Wales for the next 100 years as they kept the streets free of carrion and rotting food.<ref name=NewKay/> Under Tudor \"vermin laws\" many creatures were seen as competitors for the produce of the countryside and bounties were paid by the parish for their carcasses.<ref name=McCarthy2007/>\n\nBy the 20th century, the breeding population was restricted to a handful of pairs in [[South Wales]], but recently the Welsh population has been supplemented by re-introductions in England and Scotland. In 2004, from 375 occupied territories identified, at least 216 pairs were thought to have hatched eggs and 200 pairs reared at least 286 young.<ref name=IUCN/> In 1989, six Swedish birds were released at a site in north Scotland and four Swedish and a Welsh bird in [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref name=\"RSPB conservation\"/> Altogether, 93 birds of Swedish and Spanish origin were released at each of the sites. In the second stage of reintroduction in 1995 and 1996, further birds were brought from Germany to populate areas of [[Dumfries and Galloway]]. Ninety-four birds were brought from the Chilterns and introduced into the [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent Valley]] in North East England between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"RSPB conservation\"/> In Northern Ireland, 80 birds from wild stock in Wales were released over three years between 2008 and 2010, and in 2010 the first successful breeding was recorded. The reintroductions in [[the Chilterns]] have been a success. Between 1989 and 1993, 90 birds were released in the Chilterns [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and by 2002, 139 pairs were breeding there.<ref name=Chilterns/> They can commonly be seen taking advantage of thermals from the [[M40 motorway]].<ref name=McCarthy2/> Another successful reintroduction has been in [[Northamptonshire]], which has become a stronghold for the red kite.<ref name=birdguides/> Thirty Spanish birds were introduced into [[Rockingham Forest]] near [[Corby]] in 2000,<ref name=northantset/> and by 2010, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB]] estimated that over 200 chicks had been reared from the initial release. So successful has the reintroduction been that 30 chicks have been transported from Rockingham Forest, for release in [[Cumbria]].<ref name=BBC/>\n\nA sighting of the first red kite in London for 150 years was reported in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper in January 2006<ref name=McCarthy2006/> and in June of that year, the UK-based Northern Kites Project reported that kites had bred in the Derwent Valley in and around [[Rowlands Gill]], [[Tyne and Wear]] for the first time since the re-introduction.<ref name=BBC2006/>\n\nIn 1999, the red kite was named 'Bird of the Century' by the [[British Trust for Ornithology]].<ref name=Radio4/> According to the Welsh Kite Trust, it has been voted \"Wales's favourite bird\".<ref name=WalesFavBird/>\n\nIn June 2010, the [[Forestry Commission]] North West England announced a three-year project to release 90 red kites in [[Grizedale Forest]], [[Cumbria]] under a special licence issued by [[Natural England]]. The Grizedale programme was be the ninth reintroduction of red kites into different regions of the UK and the final re-introduction phase in England.<ref name=WestmorlandGazette/>\n\nThe stated aims of the Grizedale project were:\n* To establish a viable population of red kites in Grizedale, South Cumbria by 2015.\n* To increase the rate of red kite expansion into North West England and link up with existing populations in Wales, Yorkshire, North East England and South West Scotland and so increase the chances of a continuous geographical range.\n* To develop community involvement and create educational opportunities arising from the project.<ref name=\"FC Poster\"/>\n\nAs of July 2011, non-breeding birds are regularly seen in all parts of Britain, and the number of breeding pairs is too large for the RSPB to continue to survey them on an annual basis.<ref name=rspb2/>\n\n===Ireland===\nRed kites were extinct in Ireland by the middle nineteenth century, due to persecution, poisoning and woodland clearance. In May 2007, [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[Dick Roche]] announced an agreement to bring at least 100 birds from Wales to restock the population as part of a 5-year programme in the [[Wicklow Mountains]], similar to the earlier [[golden eagle]] reintroduction programme.<ref name=NDP/> On 19 July 2007, the first thirty red kites were released in [[County Wicklow]].<ref name=environ.ie/><ref name=wildlifeextra/> On 22 May 2010, 2 newly hatched red kite chicks were discovered in the [[County Wicklow|Wicklow mountains]],<ref name=Melia2010/> bringing the number of chicks hatched since reintroduction to 7.<ref name=goldeneagle/>\n\n===Sweden===\nSweden is one location where the red kite seems to be increasing, with around 2000 pairs in 2009, some of which are overwintering and some flying south to the Mediterranean for the winter. They return around March\u2013April. The red kite is the landscape bird of [[Scania]], and the coat of arms of the municipality of [[Tomelilla]].
