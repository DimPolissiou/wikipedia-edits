The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length. WWE airs a pre-show before most Network events known as the ''Kickoff'' show. Each ''Kickoff'' show includes matches, interviews, and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up. The ''Kickoff'' pre-show began as a 30-minute show<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/extremerules/2014/extreme-rules-on-wwe-network-26270262|title=Extreme Rules 2014|publisher=}}</ref> before expanding to 1 hour, beginning with [[Night of Champions (2014)|Night of Champions]] in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Night of Champions 2014|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2014/christian-peep-show-kickoff-26656371|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The \"Big Four\" ''Kickoff'' shows are the longest, at 2 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=LL Cool J To Open WrestleMania, 2-Hour ''Kickoff'' Show - SEScoops|url=http://www.sescoops.com/ll-cool-jay-to-open-wrestlemania-31-2-hour-kickoff-show/|date=16 March 2015|publisher=}}</ref> WWE occasionally airs a post-show after some Network events.

Each TakeOver pre-show includes interviews and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up. The TakeOver pre-shows are typically 30 minutes in length while some have been 1 hour, beginning with [[NXT TakeOver: San Antonio|TakeOver: San Antonio]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-san-antonio-2017-01-28/article/nxt-takeover-san-antonio-wwe-network?client=safari|title=Don\u2019t miss NXT TakeOver: San Antonio tonight|publisher=}}</ref> WWE also occasionally aired a post-show after TakeOver events known as ''TakeOver Fallout''.

In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands.

In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

As an undergraduate at Harvard, he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. He is best known for his positions on foreign policy, especially his battle with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1919 over the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The failure of that treaty ensured that the United States never joined the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=\"AmExper\">{{cite web |title=The Great War: A Nation Comes of Age - Part 3, Transcript |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/great-war/#transcript |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=21 May 2019 |date=3 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520125359/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/great-war/#transcript |archive-date=20 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], Lodge won election to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] after graduating from Harvard. He and his close friend, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], opposed [[James G. Blaine]]'s nomination at the [[1884 Republican National Convention]], but supported Blaine in the general election against [[Grover Cleveland]]. Lodge was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1886 before joining the [[United States Senate]] in 1893.\n\nIn the Senate, he sponsored the unsuccessful [[Lodge Bill]], which sought to protect the voting rights of [[African Americans]]. He supported the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and called for the annexation of the [[Philippines]] after the war. He also supported immigration restrictions, becoming a member of the [[Immigration Restriction League]] and influencing the [[Immigration Act of 1917]]. Lodge served as Chairman of the [[1900 Republican National Convention|1900]] and [[1908 Republican National Convention]]s. A member of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Lodge opposed Roosevelt's [[third party (United States)|third party]] bid for president in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], but the two remained close friends.\n\nDuring the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, Lodge advocated entrance into [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]. He became Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States Senate|Senate Republican Conference]] and Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], emerging as the leader of the Senate Republicans. He led the opposition to Wilson's Treaty of Versailles, proposing [[Lodge Reservations|twelve reservations]] to the treaty.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> He most strongly objected to the provision of the treaty that required all nations to repel aggression, fearing that this would erode Congressional powers and commit the U.S. to burdensome obligations. Lodge prevailed in the treaty battle and Lodge's objections would influence the [[United Nations]], the successor to the League of Nations. After the war, Lodge participated in the creation of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which sought to prevent a naval [[arms race]]. He remained in the Senate until his death in 1924.\n\n==Early life==\nLodge was born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]]. His father was John Ellerton [[Lodge family|Lodge]].

Lodge represented his home state in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1887 to 1893 and in the Senate from 1893 to 1924.\n\nAlong with his close friend Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge was sympathetic to the concerns of the [[Mugwump]] faction of the Republican Party. Nonetheless, both reluctantly supported [[James Blaine]] and [[protectionism]] in the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 election]]. Blaine lost narrowly.<ref>David M. Tucker, ''Mugwumps: Public Moralists of the Gilded Age'' (1991).</ref> Lodge was a staunch supporter of the [[gold standard]], vehemently opposing the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] and the [[silverite]]s, who were led by the populist Democrat [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896.\n\nLodge was easily reelected time and again but his greatest challenge came in his reelection bid in January 1911. The Democrats had made significant gains in Massachusetts and the Republicans were split between the progressive and conservative wings, with Lodge trying to mollify both sides. In a major speech before the legislature voted, Lodge took pride in his long selfless service to the state. He emphasized that he had never engaged in corruption or self-dealing. He rarely campaigned on his own behalf but now he made his case, explaining his important roles in civil service reform, maintaining the gold standard, expanding the Navy, developing policies for the Philippine Islands, and trying to restrict immigration by illiterate Europeans, as well as his support for some progressive reforms. Most of all he appealed to party loyalty. Lodge was reelected by five votes.<ref>John A. Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge: A Biography'' (1953) 280-83</ref>\n\nLodge was very close to Theodore Roosevelt for both of their entire careers. However, Lodge was too conservative to accept Roosevelt's attacks on the judiciary in 1910, and his call for the initiative, referendum, and recall. Lodge stood silent when Roosevelt broke with the party and ran as a third-party candidate in 1912. Lodge voted for Taft instead of Roosevelt; after Woodrow Wilson won the election the Lodge-Roosevelt friendship resumed.<ref>Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge: A Biography'' (1953) 287-91, 323</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nIn 1890, Lodge co-authored the [[Lodge Bill|Federal Elections Bill]], along with Sen. [[George Frisbie Hoar]], that guaranteed federal protection for [[African American]] voting rights. Although the proposed legislation was supported by President [[Benjamin Harrison]], the bill was blocked by filibustering Democrats in the Senate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kirt H.\n|title=The Politics of Place and Presidential Rhetoric in the United States, 1875\u20131901|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=oxAy2SDXvBkC&pg=PP1&dq=Civil+rights+rhetoric+and+the+American+presidency&q=|accessdate=November 19, 2011 |year=2005|chapter=1 |pages=32, 33 |isbn=978-1-58544-440-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1891, he became a member of the Massachusetts Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. He was assigned national membership number 4,901.\n\nThat same year, following the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynching of eleven Italian Americans]] in New Orleans, Lodge published an article blaming the victims and proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.<ref>{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Leach|first1=Eugene E.|title=Mental Epidemics: Crowd Psychology and American Culture, 1890\u20131940|journal=American Studies|publisher=Mid-America American Studies Association|volume=33|issue=1|pages=5\u201329|date=1992|jstor=40644255}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lodge|first1=Henry Cabot|title=Lynch Law and Unrestricted Immigration|journal=The North American Review|date=May 1891|volume=152|issue=414|pages=602\u2013612|jstor=25102181}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish\u2013American War===\nLodge was a strong backer of U.S. intervention in [[Cuba]] in 1898, arguing that it was the moral responsibility of the United States to do so:\n\n<blockquote>Of the sympathies of the American people, generous, liberty-loving, I have no question. They are with the Cubans in their struggle for freedom. I believe our people would welcome any action on the part of the United States to put an end to the terrible state of things existing there. We can stop it. We can stop it peacefully. We can stop it, in my judgment, by pursuing a proper diplomacy and offering our good offices. Let it once be understood that we mean to stop the horrible state of things in Cuba and it will be stopped. The great power of the United States, if it is once invoked and uplifted, is capable of greater things than that.</blockquote>\n\nFollowing American victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Lodge came to represent the imperialist faction of the Senate, those who called for the annexation of the [[Philippines]]. Lodge maintained that the United States needed to have a strong navy and be more involved in foreign affairs.\n\nIn a letter to Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge wrote, \"Porto Rico is not forgotten and we mean to have it\".<ref name=\"Puerto Rico\">{{cite web |title=Spanish-American War in Puerto Rico |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64500545.pdf |website=National Park Service |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |accessdate=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211073515/https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64500545.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Immigration===\n[[File:Cabotlodgebritannica.jpg|thumb|left|Lodge in 1909]]\nLodge was a vocal proponent of immigration restrictions, for a number of reasons. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, significant numbers of immigrants, primarily from Eastern and Southern Europe, were migrating to industrial centers in the USA. Lodge argueed that unskilled foreign labor was undermining the standard of living for American workers, and that a mass influx of uneducated immigrants would result in social conflict and national decline.\n\nHis position was also influenced by his [[racism|racist]] beliefse. In a May 1891 article on Italian immigration, Lodge expressed his concern that immigration by \"the races who have peopled the United States\" was declining, while \"the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood\" was on the rise.<ref>Lodge (1891), p. 611</ref> He considered northern Italians superior to southern Italians, not only because they tended to be better educated, but because they were more \"Teutonic\" than their southern counterparts, whose immigration he sought to restrict.<ref name=\"puleo\">{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|title=The Boston Italians|date=2007|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807050361|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bostonitaliansst00stev/page/n103 82]\u201383|url=https://archive.org/details/bostonitaliansst00stev|url-access=registration|access-date=2016-02-11}}</ref><ref name=\"puleo2\">{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|title=Dark Tide: The Great Molasses Flood of 1919|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807096673|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWtJGLG0aEcC&pg=PA34}}</ref>\n\nLodge was a supporter of \"100% Americanism,\" a common theme in the nativist movement of the era. In an address to the New England Society of Brooklyn in 1888, Lodge stated:\n\n<blockquote>Let every man honor and love the land of his birth and the race from which he springs and keep their memory green. It is a pious and honorable duty. But let us have done with British-Americans and Irish-Americans and German-Americans, and so on, and all be Americans ... If a man is going to be an American at all let him be so without any qualifying adjectives; and if he is going to be something else, let him drop the word American from his personal description.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lodge |first1=Henry Cabot |title=Speeches |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |date=1892 |page=[https://archive.org/details/speeches00lodggoog/page/n60 46] |url=https://archive.org/details/speeches00lodggoog |access-date=2016-10-18 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe did not believe, however, that all races were equally capable or worthy of being assimilated. In ''The Great Peril of Unrestricted Immigration'' he wrote that \"you can take a Hindoo and give him the highest education the world can afford ... but you cannot make him an Englishman\", and cautioned against the mixing of \"higher\" and \"lower\" races:\n\n<blockquote>On the moral qualities of the English-speaking race, therefore, rest our history, our victories, and all our future. There is only one way in which you can lower those qualities or weaken those characteristics, and that is by breeding them out. If a lower race mixes with a higher in sufficient numbers, history teaches us that the lower race will prevail.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lodge|first1=Henry Cabot|editor1-last=Frink|editor1-first=Henry Allyn|title=The New Century Speaker for School and College|date=1898|publisher=Ginn|pages=177\u2013179|chapter=The Great Peril of Unrestricted Immigration|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pYAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA177|access-date=2016-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019070943/https://books.google.com/books?id=4pYAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA177|archive-date=2017-10-19|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the public voice of the [[Immigration Restriction League]], Lodge argued in support of literacy tests for incoming immigrants. The tests would be designed to exclude members of those races he deemed \"most alien to the body of the American people.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Thomas H. |authorlink=Thomas H.

From 1907 to 1911, he served on the [[Dillingham Commission]], a joint congressional committee established to study the era's immigration patterns and make recommendations to Congress based on its findings. The Commission's recommendations led to the [[Immigration Act of 1917]].\n\n===World War I===\nLodge was a staunch advocate of entering [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], attacking President [[Woodrow Wilson]] for poor military preparedness and accusing pacifists of undermining American patriotism. After the United States entered the war, Lodge continued to attack Wilson as hopelessly idealistic, assailing Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] as unrealistic and weak. He contended that Germany needed to be militarily and economically crushed and saddled with harsh penalties so that it could never again be a threat to the stability of Europe. However, apart from policy differences, even before the end of Wilson's first term and well before America's entry into the Great War, Lodge confided to Teddy Roosevelt, \"I never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred I feel toward Wilson.\"<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.

He  wanted to join the [[League of Nations]] with reservations. The Democrats in the Senate, following Wilson's direction, rejected Lodge's proposal to join the League with reservations.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> Republicans opposed joining under Wilson's terms of no reservations which meant the League could force the U.S. to enter a war without approval of Congress. In the end, the U.S. never joined the League of Nations.<ref>David Mervin, \"Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations.\" ''Journal of American Studies'' 4#2 (1971): 201-214.</ref>\n\nLodge won in the long run: his reservations were incorporated into the United Nations in 1945, and the U.S. was given a veto.<ref>Leo Gross,  \"The Charter of the United Nations and the Lodge Reservations.\" ''American Journal of International Law'' 41.3 (1947): 531-554.

Lodge rejected an open-ended commitment that was regardless of relevance to the national security interests of the United States. He especially insisted that Congress must approve interventions. Lodge was also motivated by political concerns; he strongly disliked Wilson{{sfn|Brands|2008|loc=part 3 at 0:00}} and was eager to find an issue for the Republican Party to run on [[1920 United States presidential election|in the presidential election of 1920]].\n\nLodge was reluctant for the U.S. to be involved in world affairs:\n\n<blockquote>The United States is the world's best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good, and endanger her very existence. Leave her to march freely through the centuries to come, as in the years that have gone. Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance; this great land of ordered liberty. For if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.{{Sfn|Lodge|1919}}</blockquote>\n\nLodge appealed to the [[patriotism]] of American citizens by objecting to what he saw as the weakening of national [[sovereignty]]: \"I have loved but one flag and I can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league.\"\n\nThe Senate was divided into a \"crazy-quilt\" of positions on the Versailles question.<ref>John Milton Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) 507\u2013560</ref> It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.<ref>Thomas A. Bailey, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945)</ref> One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a Treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. Finally, a bi-partisan group of 13 \"irreconcilables\" opposed a treaty in any form. The closest the Treaty came to passage was in mid-November 1919, when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's [[stroke]] on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: \"Wilson's emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped. ... Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on [[delusion]].\"<ref>Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson,'' 544, 557\u2013560; Bailey calls Wilson's rejection, \"The Supreme Infanticide,\" ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) p. 271</ref> \n\nThe Treaty of Versailles went into effect but the United States did not sign it, and made separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The League of Nations went into operation, but the United States never joined.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> Historians agree that the League was ineffective in dealing with major issues, but they debate whether American membership would have made much difference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward C.

That is, the UN was structured in accordance with Lodge's plan, with the United States having a veto power in the UN which it did not have in the old League of Nations. [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], Lodge's grandson, served as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]] from 1953 to 1960.\n\n===Washington Naval Conference ===\nIn 1922, President Warren G. Harding appointed Lodge as a delegate to the [[Washington Naval Conference]] (International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments), led by Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and included [[Elihu Root]] and [[Oscar Underwood]].

Attended by nine nations, the United States, [[Japan]], [[China]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Portugal]], the conference resulted in three major treaties: [[Four-Power Treaty]], Five-Power Treaty (more commonly known as the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]) and the [[Nine-Power Treaty]], as well as a number of smaller agreements.<ref>Raymond Leslie Buell,  [https://archive.org/details/cu31924007479607 <!-- quote=Lodge. --> ''The Washington Conference''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032504/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=A-02AQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=Washington+Naval+Conference&ots=jAcJ5ATME6&sig=sWuw65fEwFlJRdILyKNfOPtdhgM#v=snippet&q=Lodge&f=false |date=2015-10-17 }} (D.

[Yet] Lodge never made the contributions he should have made, largely because of Lodge the person. He was opportunistic, selfish, jealous, condescending, supercilious, and could never resist calling his opponent's spade a dirty shovel.

As an undergraduate at Harvard, he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.

He and his close friend, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], opposed [[James G. Blaine]]'s nomination at the [[1884 Republican National Convention]], but supported Blaine in the general election against [[Grover Cleveland]]. Lodge was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1886 before joining the [[United States Senate]] in 1893.\n\nIn the Senate, he sponsored the unsuccessful [[Lodge Bill]], which sought to protect the voting rights of [[African Americans]]. He supported the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and called for the annexation of the [[Philippines]] after the war. He also supported immigration restrictions, becoming a member of the [[Immigration Restriction League]] and influencing the [[Immigration Act of 1917]]. Lodge served as Chairman of the [[1900 Republican National Convention|1900]] and [[1908 Republican National Convention]]s. A member of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Lodge opposed Roosevelt's [[third party (United States)|third party]] bid for president in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], but the two remained close friends.\n\nDuring the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, Lodge advocated entrance into [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]. He became Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States Senate|Senate Republican Conference]] and Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], emerging as the leader of the Senate Republicans. He led the opposition to Wilson's Treaty of Versailles, proposing [[Lodge Reservations|twelve reservations]] to the treaty.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> He most strongly objected to the provision of the treaty that required all nations to repel aggression, fearing that this would erode Congressional powers and commit the U.S. to burdensome obligations. Lodge prevailed in the treaty battle and Lodge's objections would influence the [[United Nations]], the successor to the League of Nations. After the war, Lodge participated in the creation of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which sought to prevent a naval [[arms race]]. He remained in the Senate until his death in 1924.\n\n==Early life==\nLodge was born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]]. His father was John Ellerton [[Lodge family|Lodge]].

Lodge represented his home state in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1887 to 1893 and in the Senate from 1893 to 1924.\n\nAlong with his close friend Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge was sympathetic to the concerns of the [[Mugwump]] faction of the Republican Party. Nonetheless, both reluctantly supported [[James Blaine]] and [[protectionism]] in the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 election]]. Blaine lost narrowly.<ref>David M. Tucker, ''Mugwumps: Public Moralists of the Gilded Age'' (1991).</ref> Lodge was a staunch supporter of the [[gold standard]], vehemently opposing the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] and the [[silverite]]s, who were led by the populist Democrat [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896.\n\nLodge was easily reelected time and again but his greatest challenge came in his reelection bid in January 1911. The Democrats had made significant gains in Massachusetts and the Republicans were split between the progressive and conservative wings, with Lodge trying to mollify both sides. In a major speech before the legislature voted, Lodge took pride in his long selfless service to the state. He emphasized that he had never engaged in corruption or self-dealing. He rarely campaigned on his own behalf but now he made his case, explaining his important roles in civil service reform, maintaining the gold standard, expanding the Navy, developing policies for the Philippine Islands, and trying to restrict immigration by illiterate Europeans, as well as his support for some progressive reforms. Most of all he appealed to party loyalty. Lodge was reelected by five votes.<ref>John A. Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge: A Biography'' (1953) 280-83</ref>\n\nLodge was very close to Theodore Roosevelt for both of their entire careers. However, Lodge was too conservative to accept Roosevelt's attacks on the judiciary in 1910, and his call for the initiative, referendum, and recall. Lodge stood silent when Roosevelt broke with the party and ran as a third-party candidate in 1912. Lodge voted for Taft instead of Roosevelt; after Woodrow Wilson won the election the Lodge-Roosevelt friendship resumed.<ref>Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge: A Biography'' (1953) 287-91, 323</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nIn 1890, Lodge co-authored the [[Lodge Bill|Federal Elections Bill]], along with Sen. [[George Frisbie Hoar]], that guaranteed federal protection for [[African American]] voting rights. Although the proposed legislation was supported by President [[Benjamin Harrison]], the bill was blocked by filibustering Democrats in the Senate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kirt H.\n|title=The Politics of Place and Presidential Rhetoric in the United States, 1875\u20131901|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=oxAy2SDXvBkC&pg=PP1&dq=Civil+rights+rhetoric+and+the+American+presidency&q=|accessdate=November 19, 2011 |year=2005|chapter=1 |pages=32, 33 |isbn=978-1-58544-440-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1891, he became a member of the Massachusetts Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. He was assigned national membership number 4,901.\n\nThat same year, following the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynching of eleven Italian Americans]] in New Orleans, Lodge published an article blaming the victims and proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.<ref>{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Leach|first1=Eugene E.|title=Mental Epidemics: Crowd Psychology and American Culture, 1890\u20131940|journal=American Studies|publisher=Mid-America American Studies Association|volume=33|issue=1|pages=5\u201329|date=1992|jstor=40644255}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lodge|first1=Henry Cabot|title=Lynch Law and Unrestricted Immigration|journal=The North American Review|date=May 1891|volume=152|issue=414|pages=602\u2013612|jstor=25102181}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish\u2013American War===\nLodge was a strong backer of U.S. intervention in [[Cuba]] in 1898, arguing that it was the moral responsibility of the United States to do so:\n\n<blockquote>Of the sympathies of the American people, generous, liberty-loving, I have no question. They are with the Cubans in their struggle for freedom. I believe our people would welcome any action on the part of the United States to put an end to the terrible state of things existing there. We can stop it. We can stop it peacefully. We can stop it, in my judgment, by pursuing a proper diplomacy and offering our good offices. Let it once be understood that we mean to stop the horrible state of things in Cuba and it will be stopped. The great power of the United States, if it is once invoked and uplifted, is capable of greater things than that.</blockquote>\n\nFollowing American victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Lodge came to represent the imperialist faction of the Senate, those who called for the annexation of the [[Philippines]]. Lodge maintained that the United States needed to have a strong navy and be more involved in foreign affairs.\n\nIn a letter to Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge wrote, \"Porto Rico is not forgotten and we mean to have it\".<ref name=\"Puerto Rico\">{{cite web |title=Spanish-American War in Puerto Rico |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64500545.pdf |website=National Park Service |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |accessdate=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211073515/https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64500545.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Immigration===\n[[File:Cabotlodgebritannica.jpg|thumb|left|Lodge in 1909]]\nLodge was a vocal proponent of immigration restrictions, for a number of reasons. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, significant numbers of immigrants, primarily from Eastern and Southern Europe, were migrating to industrial centers in the USA. Lodge argueed that unskilled foreign labor was undermining the standard of living for American workers, and that a mass influx of uneducated immigrants would result in social conflict and national decline.\n\nHis position was also influenced by his [[racism|racist]] beliefse. In a May 1891 article on Italian immigration, Lodge expressed his concern that immigration by \"the races who have peopled the United States\" was declining, while \"the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood\" was on the rise.<ref>Lodge (1891), p. 611</ref> He considered northern Italians superior to southern Italians, not only because they tended to be better educated, but because they were more \"Teutonic\" than their southern counterparts, whose immigration he sought to restrict.<ref name=\"puleo\">{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|title=The Boston Italians|date=2007|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807050361|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bostonitaliansst00stev/page/n103 82]\u201383|url=https://archive.org/details/bostonitaliansst00stev|url-access=registration|access-date=2016-02-11}}</ref><ref name=\"puleo2\">{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|title=Dark Tide: The Great Molasses Flood of 1919|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807096673|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWtJGLG0aEcC&pg=PA34}}</ref>\n\nLodge was a supporter of \"100% Americanism,\" a common theme in the nativist movement of the era. In an address to the New England Society of Brooklyn in 1888, Lodge stated:\n\n<blockquote>Let every man honor and love the land of his birth and the race from which he springs and keep their memory green.

From 1907 to 1911, he served on the [[Dillingham Commission]], a joint congressional committee established to study the era's immigration patterns and make recommendations to Congress based on its findings. The Commission's recommendations led to the [[Immigration Act of 1917]].\n\n===World War I===\nLodge was a staunch advocate of entering [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], attacking President [[Woodrow Wilson]] for poor military preparedness and accusing pacifists of undermining American patriotism. After the United States entered the war, Lodge continued to attack Wilson as hopelessly idealistic, assailing Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] as unrealistic and weak. He contended that Germany needed to be militarily and economically crushed and saddled with harsh penalties so that it could never again be a threat to the stability of Europe. However, apart from policy differences, even before the end of Wilson's first term and well before America's entry into the Great War, Lodge confided to Teddy Roosevelt, \"I never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred I feel toward Wilson.\"<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.

He  wanted to join the [[League of Nations]] with reservations. The Democrats in the Senate, following Wilson's direction, rejected Lodge's proposal to join the League with reservations.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> Republicans opposed joining under Wilson's terms of no reservations which meant the League could force the U.S. to enter a war without approval of Congress.

Lodge rejected an open-ended commitment that was regardless of relevance to the national security interests of the United States. He especially insisted that Congress must approve interventions. Lodge was also motivated by political concerns; he strongly disliked Wilson{{sfn|Brands|2008|loc=part 3 at 0:00}} and was eager to find an issue for the Republican Party to run on [[1920 United States presidential election|in the presidential election of 1920]].\n\nLodge was reluctant for the U.S. to be involved in world affairs:\n\n<blockquote>The United States is the world's best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her powerful good, and endanger her very existence. Leave her to march freely through the centuries to come, as in the years that have gone. Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance; this great land of ordered liberty. For if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.{{Sfn|Lodge|1919}}</blockquote>\n\nLodge appealed to the [[patriotism]] of American citizens by objecting to what he saw as the weakening of national [[sovereignty]]: \"I have loved but one flag and I can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league.\"\n\nThe Senate was divided into a \"crazy-quilt\" of positions on the Versailles question.<ref>John Milton Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) 507\u2013560</ref> It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.<ref>Thomas A. Bailey, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945)</ref> One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a Treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. Finally, a bi-partisan group of 13 \"irreconcilables\" opposed a treaty in any form. The closest the Treaty came to passage was in mid-November 1919, when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's [[stroke]] on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: \"Wilson's emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped. ... Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on [[delusion]].\"<ref>Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson,'' 544, 557\u2013560; Bailey calls Wilson's rejection, \"The Supreme Infanticide,\" ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) p. 271</ref> \n\nThe Treaty of Versailles went into effect but the United States did not sign it, and made separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The League of Nations went into operation, but the United States never joined.<ref name=\"AmExper\"/> Historians agree that the League was ineffective in dealing with major issues, but they debate whether American membership would have made much difference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward C.

That is, the UN was structured in accordance with Lodge's plan, with the United States having a veto power in the UN which it did not have in the old League of Nations.

[Yet] Lodge never made the contributions he should have made, largely because of Lodge the person. He was opportunistic, selfish, jealous, condescending, supercilious, and could never resist calling his opponent's spade a dirty shovel.
