He was drafted by the [[Boston Celtics]] with the 18th overall pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]]. Known for his dunking skill, he has performed well in many slam dunk competitions, having won the 2005 McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest and the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game#Slam Dunk Contest|2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], while finishing as the runner-up in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game#Sprite Slam Dunk Contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web| url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/654/654675p1.html | title=Gerald Green: Color of Money | last=Robinson | first=Jon | work=[[IGN]] | date=2005-09-29 | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born in Houston, Texas. When he was in the 6th grade, he was involved in an accident that left a significant portion of his right [[ring finger]] cut off. He was wearing a ring on his right ring finger when he attempted a [[Slam dunk|dunk]] on a makeshift basketball hoop. The ring caught onto a nail on the goal and his finger was ripped, with [[amputation]] being the only option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/08/report-bucks-mirza-teletovic-expected-to-be-out-until-late-in-regular-season/|title=Gerald Green only has part of his ring finger on his right hand. Wait, what?|author=Matt Moore|work=Sports|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nGreen did not play high school basketball until his sophomore year, when he played junior [[Varsity team|varsity]] for [[J. Frank Dobie High School]]. In his junior year, he made the varsity team, but his play was cut short because of academic issues.<ref name=\"grantland.com\">http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7828599/the-improbable-return-nba-new-jersey-nets-gerald-green</ref>\n\nGreen transferred to a charter school, [[Gulf Shores Academy]] in Houston where he repeated his junior year.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/> In his senior year at Gulf Shores, he averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. He was named an All-American and was the high scorer with 24 points in the [[2005 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|2005 McDonald's All-American Game]],<ref>[http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp NBADraft.net | 2005 McDonald's All-American Game Recap<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180146/http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp |date=2008-05-14 }}</ref> which features two teams composed of the best high school basketball players in the United States. Green also won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest that year, defeating future [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] player [[Josh McRoberts]].\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Green was listed as the No. 1 player in the nation in 2005.<ref>[https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2005/gerald-green-35123 Gerald Green Recruiting Profile]</ref>\n\nGreen originally committed to [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State University]], but later decided to enter the [[NBA draft]] upon graduation. He hired an agent, thereby making himself ineligible to participate in [[NCAA]] athletics.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Draft===\nGreen was expected by many analysts to be one of the top players chosen but he fell to the Celtics, who selected him with the 18th pick in the [[NBA draft]]. His fall is attributed to his decision to give individual workouts only for the teams with the top six picks prior to the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\nGreen drew comparisons to former [[Houston Rockets]] teammate and star [[Tracy McGrady]] in the period leading up to the [[2005 NBA draft]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nGreen was one of the last players to enter the NBA directly from high school, as the collective bargaining agreement between NBA owners and the [[National Basketball Players Association]] now mandates that American players who enter the draft must be at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class and reach age 19 no later than December 31 of the calendar year of the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\n===Boston Celtics (2005\u20132007)===\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nDuring the pre-season, Green averaged 8 points and 1.3 rebounds per game for the Celtics in the 2005 Las Vegas Summer League.<ref>[http://www.vegassummerleague.com/teams.cfm?team=1 Boston Celtics summer league statistics]</ref>\n\nAfter seeing limited playing time during the first part of the season, Green was placed on the [[Fayetteville Patriots]] of the [[NBA D-League]] by the Celtics in January 2006. He was recalled and activated to an NBA roster position on February 3. He was reassigned to the NBDL, to the [[Florida Flame]], on February 16. He was recalled and activated again on February 21, and saw his first significant NBA game action on the following night, scoring 13 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in 23 minutes.\n\nHe appeared in 32 games and averaged 11.8 minutes, 5.2 points, and 1.2 rebounds during these contests. Green left marks on the league with his highlight plays including a shot clock beating half court three against Indiana and two ''[[SportsCenter]]'' top play dunks in the closing seconds in two games against the [[Toronto Raptors]].\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\nOver the off-season, Green aimed at improving all aspects of his game in order to gain playing time. He had shown flashes of his capability during the end of the 2005\u201306 season, but started off the 2006\u201307 season slowly, earning a somewhat limited role and playing time behind captain [[Paul Pierce]], and swingman [[Wally Szczerbiak]]. With injuries to Szczerbiak and Pierce, his playing time increased, but he was unable to nail down a starting role. Green started his first-ever game early December against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], but then lost his job to a returning Szczerbiak. Green finished the 2006\u201307 season averaging 10.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.\n\nOn February 17, 2007, Green won the 2007 [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], beating out [[Nate Robinson]], [[Tyrus Thomas]], and [[Dwight Howard]].\n\nThe season was going very well for Green. On March 16, 2007, he scored a career-high 25 points in a Celtics loss to the [[Dallas Mavericks]],<ref name=BOSATL/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270316006 Nowitzki, Howard help Mavs rebound from back-to-back losses]</ref> and on April 10, 2007, Green topped that with 33 points (12-22 FG, 4-5 3FG) at [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]].<ref name=BOSATL>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270410001 Hawks pull out victory in battle of shorthanded teams]</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2007 it was made official that Green was to be traded along with [[Al Jefferson]], [[Ryan Gomes]], [[Theo Ratliff]], [[Sebastian Telfair]], and draft picks, to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for [[Kevin Garnett]].<ref>[http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 Garnett deal finalized - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818092445/http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota Timberwolves (2007\u20132008)===\nAt Minnesota, Green found himself stuck on the bench behind a number of players at his same position. In early January 2008, Green's agent asked the Timberwolves to trade his client.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/01/26/green_wants_a_trade/ Green wants a trade]</ref>\n\nAt the [[2008 NBA slam dunk contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], Green opened the competition with a dunk he called \"The Birthday Cake\" in which he blew out a birthday candle on a cupcake set on the back of the rim while dunking. He followed that up with an alley-oop two-handed windmill. His first dunk of the second round was an alley-oop from behind the basket which he put between his legs before dunking. His final dunk of the night was a between-the-legs one-handed slam that he performed after taking off his shoes. He ended up finishing second to [[Dwight Howard]], after Howard received seventy-eight percent of the votes cast by fans through text message.<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/other_nba/view.bg?articleid=1074114&srvc=rss Howard ends Green\u2019s reign - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/tnt/allstar/nba_dunk_best_021708.asx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225044834/http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/tnt/allstar/nba_dunk_best_021708.asx |archivedate=2008-12-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Houston Rockets (2008)===\nOn February 21, 2008, Green was traded to his hometown team [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Kirk Snyder]], a [[Paul\u00e3o Prestes|2010 second-round draft]] pick, and cash considerations.

In the [[Vegas Summer League]] he averaged an underwhelming 13.3 ppg and 3.8 rpg on 38% shooting from the field. On a bright note, he was 43% from beyond the arc. Following the Vegas Summer League, the Mavericks and Green participated in the [[Rocky Mountain Revue]], a summer league held in Salt Lake City, Utah. There in just 25.8 mpg Green averaged 17.7 ppg to go with 2.7 rpg, 1.8 apg, 1 spg, .5 bpg, and a respectable 2.2 topg. This time around, Green shot a much more impressive 45%, including going 12 for 26 from behind the three point line (46%), and 28-31 from the free throw line (90%). His overall performance was enough to earn him All-Revue Team honors.\n\n===Outside the NBA (2009\u20132011)===\nGreen signed with [[PBC Lokomotiv Kuban]] of Russia on December 2009.<ref name=\"realgm\">[http://realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/63428/20091215/gerald_green_signs_with_russian_team/ Gerald Green Signs With Russian Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218173602/http://realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/63428/20091215/gerald_green_signs_with_russian_team |date=2010-02-18 }}.

He was drafted by the [[Boston Celtics]] with the 18th overall pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]]. Known for his dunking skill, he has performed well in many slam dunk competitions, having won the 2005 McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest and the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game#Slam Dunk Contest|2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], while finishing as the runner-up in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game#Sprite Slam Dunk Contest|2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web| url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/654/654675p1.html | title=Gerald Green: Color of Money | last=Robinson | first=Jon | work=[[IGN]] | date=2005-09-29 | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born in Houston, Texas. When he was in the 6th grade, he was involved in an accident that left a significant portion of his right [[ring finger]] cut off. He was wearing a ring on his right ring finger when he attempted a [[Slam dunk|dunk]] on a makeshift basketball hoop. The ring caught onto a nail on the goal and his finger was ripped, with [[amputation]] being the only option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/08/report-bucks-mirza-teletovic-expected-to-be-out-until-late-in-regular-season/|title=Gerald Green only has part of his ring finger on his right hand.

Frank Dobie High School]]. In his junior year, he made the varsity team, but his play was cut short because of academic issues.<ref name=\"grantland.com\">http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7828599/the-improbable-return-nba-new-jersey-nets-gerald-green</ref>\n\nGreen transferred to a charter school, [[Gulf Shores Academy]] in Houston where he repeated his junior year.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/> In his senior year at Gulf Shores, he averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. He was named an All-American and was the high scorer with 24 points in the [[2005 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|2005 McDonald's All-American Game]],<ref>[http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp NBADraft.net | 2005 McDonald's All-American Game Recap<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180146/http://nbadraft.net/2005mcdonalds001.asp |date=2008-05-14 }}</ref> which features two teams composed of the best high school basketball players in the United States. Green also won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest that year, defeating future [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] player [[Josh McRoberts]].\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Green was listed as the No. 1 player in the nation in 2005.<ref>[https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2005/gerald-green-35123 Gerald Green Recruiting Profile]</ref>\n\nGreen originally committed to [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State University]], but later decided to enter the [[NBA draft]] upon graduation. He hired an agent, thereby making himself ineligible to participate in [[NCAA]] athletics.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Draft===\nGreen was expected by many analysts to be one of the top players chosen but he fell to the Celtics, who selected him with the 18th pick in the [[NBA draft]]. His fall is attributed to his decision to give individual workouts only for the teams with the top six picks prior to the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\nGreen drew comparisons to former [[Houston Rockets]] teammate and star [[Tracy McGrady]] in the period leading up to the [[2005 NBA draft]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nGreen was one of the last players to enter the NBA directly from high school, as the collective bargaining agreement between NBA owners and the [[National Basketball Players Association]] now mandates that American players who enter the draft must be at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class and reach age 19 no later than December 31 of the calendar year of the draft.<ref name=\"grantland.com\"/>\n\n===Boston Celtics (2005\u20132007)===\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nDuring the pre-season, Green averaged 8 points and 1.3 rebounds per game for the Celtics in the 2005 Las Vegas Summer League.<ref>[http://www.vegassummerleague.com/teams.cfm?team=1 Boston Celtics summer league statistics]</ref>\n\nAfter seeing limited playing time during the first part of the season, Green was placed on the [[Fayetteville Patriots]] of the [[NBA D-League]] by the Celtics in January 2006. He was recalled and activated to an NBA roster position on February 3. He was reassigned to the NBDL, to the [[Florida Flame]], on February 16. He was recalled and activated again on February 21, and saw his first significant NBA game action on the following night, scoring 13 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in 23 minutes.\n\nHe appeared in 32 games and averaged 11.8 minutes, 5.2 points, and 1.2 rebounds during these contests. Green left marks on the league with his highlight plays including a shot clock beating half court three against Indiana and two ''[[SportsCenter]]'' top play dunks in the closing seconds in two games against the [[Toronto Raptors]].\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\nOver the off-season, Green aimed at improving all aspects of his game in order to gain playing time. He had shown flashes of his capability during the end of the 2005\u201306 season, but started off the 2006\u201307 season slowly, earning a somewhat limited role and playing time behind captain [[Paul Pierce]], and swingman [[Wally Szczerbiak]]. With injuries to Szczerbiak and Pierce, his playing time increased, but he was unable to nail down a starting role. Green started his first-ever game early December against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], but then lost his job to a returning Szczerbiak. Green finished the 2006\u201307 season averaging 10.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.\n\nOn February 17, 2007, Green won the 2007 [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], beating out [[Nate Robinson]], [[Tyrus Thomas]], and [[Dwight Howard]].\n\nThe season was going very well for Green. On March 16, 2007, he scored a career-high 25 points in a Celtics loss to the [[Dallas Mavericks]],<ref name=BOSATL/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270316006 Nowitzki, Howard help Mavs rebound from back-to-back losses]</ref> and on April 10, 2007, Green topped that with 33 points (12-22 FG, 4-5 3FG) at [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]].<ref name=BOSATL>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270410001 Hawks pull out victory in battle of shorthanded teams]</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2007 it was made official that Green was to be traded along with [[Al Jefferson]], [[Ryan Gomes]], [[Theo Ratliff]], [[Sebastian Telfair]], and draft picks, to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for [[Kevin Garnett]].<ref>[http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 Garnett deal finalized - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818092445/http://celtics.bostonherald.com/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014449 |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota Timberwolves (2007\u20132008)===\nAt Minnesota, Green found himself stuck on the bench behind a number of players at his same position.

He followed that up with an alley-oop two-handed windmill. His first dunk of the second round was an alley-oop from behind the basket which he put between his legs before dunking. His final dunk of the night was a between-the-legs one-handed slam that he performed after taking off his shoes. He ended up finishing second to [[Dwight Howard]], after Howard received seventy-eight percent of the votes cast by fans through text message.<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/other_nba/view.bg?articleid=1074114&srvc=rss Howard ends Green\u2019s reign - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/tnt/allstar/nba_dunk_best_021708.asx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225044834/http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/tnt/allstar/nba_dunk_best_021708.asx |archivedate=2008-12-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Houston Rockets (2008)===\nOn February 21, 2008, Green was traded to his hometown team [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Kirk Snyder]], a [[Paul\u00e3o Prestes|2010 second-round draft]] pick, and cash considerations.

In the [[Vegas Summer League]] he averaged an underwhelming 13.3 ppg and 3.8 rpg on 38% shooting from the field. On a bright note, he was 43% from beyond the arc. Following the Vegas Summer League, the Mavericks and Green participated in the [[Rocky Mountain Revue]], a summer league held in Salt Lake City, Utah. There in just 25.8 mpg Green averaged 17.7 ppg to go with 2.7 rpg, 1.8 apg, 1 spg, .5 bpg, and a respectable 2.2 topg. This time around, Green shot a much more impressive 45%, including going 12 for 26 from behind the three point line (46%), and 28-31 from the free throw line (90%). His overall performance was enough to earn him All-Revue Team honors.\n\n===Outside the NBA (2009\u20132011)===\nGreen signed with [[PBC Lokomotiv Kuban]] of Russia on December 2009.<ref name=\"realgm\">[http://realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/63428/20091215/gerald_green_signs_with_russian_team/ Gerald Green Signs With Russian Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218173602/http://realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/63428/20091215/gerald_green_signs_with_russian_team |date=2010-02-18 }}.

Originally the stupa named Phra Thom Chedi means the big stupa in ancient [[Khmer language]] or the royal stupa in [[Northern Thai language]]. One of the common misunderstandings about this stupa is that Phra Pathommachedi is the oldest and the first stupa in [[Suvarnabhumi]], an ancient name of [[Southeast Asia]]. Modern Historians believe that the stupa was one of the principal stupas of ancient Nakhon Pathom, the largest settlement of [[Dvaravati]] culture in [[Nakhon Pathom]] area together with the nearby [[Phra Prathon Chedi]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e42\u0e17\u0e13\u0e40\u0e08\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c}}) during the 6th to the 8th centuries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Dvaravati Period===\n{{main|Dvaravati}}\nThe original of Phra Pathommachedi has no historical record, but according to [[:fr:Subhadradis Diskul|Subhadradis Diskul]], a prominent Thai historian and archaeologist, [[Ashoka]], an Indian Emperor who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from circa 269 to 232 BCE, sent prominent Buddhist monks to expand Buddhism in [[Suvarnabhumi]] including the area that is [[Nakhon Pathom]] in the present day. A Buddhist temple, Wat Phra Pathom, had been established around the year 325 BCE, and the stupa had been built around the year 193 BCE.<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/30182414/Phra-Pathom-Chedi-is-the-oldest-Buddhist-monument-in-Thailand</ref> The original structure is believed to be similar with the Great Stupa in [[Sanchi]],<ref>http://www.tourismthailand.org/See-and-Do/Sights-and-Attractions-Detail/Phra-Pathom-Chedi--5111</ref> India, with a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of [[Gautama Buddha]] with a structure on the top of the stupa in the shape of a [[Chatra (umbrella)|chatra]] or parasol symbolising high rank. The stupa is first mentioned in [[Buddhist texts]] of the year 675, however archaeological findings date back to the 4th century. Modern Historians believe that the stupa was one of the principal stupas of ancient Nakhon Pathom, the largest settlement of Dvaravati culture together with the nearby [[Phra Prathon Chedi]] ({{lang|th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e42\u0e17\u0e13\u0e40\u0e08\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c}}) during the 6th to the 8th centuries.\n\n===Legend of Phaya Gong and Phaya Phan===\n\n[[Image:Phrapathomchedireplic06.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Replica of Phra Pathommachedi before restoration]]\n\nSince the origin of Phra Pathommachedi is unknown, there are many legends about the stupa construction. The most famous is the legend of Phraya Gong and Phraya Phan<ref name=\"Bangkok Magazine\">http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/phra-pathom.htm</ref> (Thai: \u0e15\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19). The story is about a king of [[Nakhon Chai Si]], Phraya Gong, who had a son named Phan. The court astrologer predicted that Phan will commit [[fratricide]] in the future. Phraya Gong then abandoned Phan. The orphan baby had been unknowingly adopted by a childness woman named Granny Hom. Granny Hom raised Phan in [[Ratchaburi]], a [[vassal]] city state of Nakhon Chai Si. One day an elephant belonging to a lord from Ratchaburi was in rut and begun attacking people. Phan went to see the elephant and was able to subdue it. After the lord from Ratchaburi heard about heroic act of Phan, he adopted Phan as his son. Phan wanted to conquer Nakhon Chaisi of Phraya Gong, so he sent a letter to Phraya Gong for challenging him to a [[war elephant]] duel. Phan killed Phraya Gong becoming king Phraya Phan. According to an ancient custom, Phraya Phan demanded Phraya Gong's wife to become his queen. When the queen met Phraya Phan, she recognized him to be her son, and told him the truth. Shocked and fearful of the truth getting out, Phraya Phan executes Granny Hom. After realising that he committed [[Anantarika-karma|a great sin]] by killing both father and a person who raised him - Granny Hom. In the year 26 BCE, Phraya Phan consulted with a group of [[arhat]]s how to atone for his sin. The arhats recommended Phraya Phan to build a great stupa, one which is of great height that even a bird can not fly higher. Phraya Phan then built a Sri Lankan style stupa by using a very big [[gong]] and his bed as a foundation and put [[Buddha]]'s tooth relic inside. Hundreds of years later, the king of [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] wanted the big gong, so he ordered his men to dig the stupa's foundation; as a result, both gong and stupa then collapsed. The Bago king tried to rebuild the stupa, so he built a Khmer style stupa on the top of this old stupa, which was the stupa form until the reign of king [[Mongkut]].\n\n===Khmer Empire and Pagan Invasion===\n\nAfter [[Khmer Empire]] annexed [[Dvaravati]] settlements including ancient [[Nakhon Pathom]], in the 11th century, the stupa had been modified with a [[Architecture of Cambodia|Khmer style]] [[prang (architecture)|prang]] on the top of stupa. [[Anawrahta]] of [[Pagan Kingdom]] invaded and plundered ancient Nakhon Pathom. Then the city and the stupa had been abandoned and later overgrown by the jungle. According to No.2 Sukhothai Inscription, a prominent monk from [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] tried to rebuild Phra Pathommachedi, but none of the archaeological evidence support this claim. In 1548 [[Maha Chakkraphat]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] rebuilt the city and named [[Nakhon Chai Si]], but because of Phra Pathommachedi was far from the new city, the stupa was left in the jungle.\n\n===Mongkut Discovery===\n[[Image:Phra-Pathom-Chedi Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|Phra Pathommachedi in 1925]]\n\nIn 1831 under the reign of king [[Rama III]], his son, prince [[Mongkut]], as a [[bhikkhu|monk]], discovered the ruin of Phra Pathommachedi and visited several times. He requested royal approval to restore the stupa, but Rama III declined. In 1832 [[Sunthorn Phu]], a famous Thai poet, accompanied prince [[Pinklao|Chutamani]] on a visit to Phra Pathommachedi. After his [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation]], [[Mongkut]] rebuilt the stupa in the Sri Lankan style, covering the old stupa as well as the new temple. The new temple has four [[vihara]]s that used for Buddhist ceremonies as well as many storage buildings to keep artifacts that were found in the nearby area. Mongkut also built a palace named Pathom Nakorn Palace near Phra Pathommachedi. [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] mentioned the reason for building this palace in the book \u201cTamnaan Wang Gao\u201d (or Tales of the Old Palaces) that during the renovation of Phra Pathommachedi, it was inconvenient to come and go from Bangkok to Nakhon Pathom within a day, thus staying overnight was obligatory. Under the royal command of Mongkut, the palace was built near the stupa. The canals of [[Maha Sawat Canal|Mahasawas]] and [[Chedi Bucha Canal|Chedi Bucha]] were also dug to facilitate commuting by boat between Bangkok and Nakhon Pathom. After 17 years of construction, the stupa and temple were finished in 1870 in the reign of [[Chulalongkorn]]. Chulalongkorn added [[Belfry (architecture)|belfries]] and imported golden brown colour [[tile]]s from [[China]] to cover the whole stupa. The population of nearby [[Nakhon Chai Si District]] was ordered to move to the newly created city around Phra Pathommachedi.\n\n===Later Development===\nIn 1907 as a crown prince, [[Vajiravudh]], after visited Phra Pathommachedi for several times, he decided to build [[Sanam Chandra Palace]] in Nakhon Pathom. He recorded the miracle stories of Phra Pathommachedi as well as renovated the stupa complex. In 1911 he built the 7.20 metres Buddha image and named Phra Ruang Rojanarit Sri Indraditya Dhammobhas Mahavajiravudhraj Pujaneeya Bophitr ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07\u0e42\u0e23\u0e08\u0e19\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c \u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e17\u0e34\u0e15\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e42\u0e21\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2a \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1b\u0e39\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e15\u0e23}}) and installed in the front [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] of Phra Pathommachedi. The ashes of [[Vajiravudh]], his consort [[Suvadhana]], and his daughter [[Bejaratana]] are kept at Phra Pathommachedi. [[Prajadhipok]] rebuilt ordination hall. In 1940 [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] selected Phra Pathommachedi as the symbol in provincial [[Seal (emblem)|seal]].\n\n[[Image:Seal Nakhon Pathom.png|thumb|left|150px|Seal of Nakhon Pathom]]\n\nIn 1966, the temple abbot found several cracks inside the stupa. Ministry of Interior sent a group of experts to check the stupa. After nine years research, the experts group reported that the stupa was in critical state and needed urgent restoration. The restoration finished in 1981. In 2008 Phra Pathommachedi had been restored again to solve inside stupa [[moisture]] problem, the works done in 2012.\n\n===Giant Incense Incident===\nIn 1998 to celebrate the 84th birthday of Phra Ruang Buddha image, Wat Phra Pathommachedi constructed three giant [[incense]] sticks to be the biggest incense stick in the world in front of the Northern Vihara. On November 2, 1998, the incense collapsed immediately causing 5 deaths and 13 injuries.\n\n===World Heritage Site Nomination===\nIn 2009 [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]], Ministry of Culture announced a plan to promote Phra Pathommachedi to be [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] because of the stupa's long history and its significance on Buddhism expansion in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Dvaravati]] culture. Initially the government plan had been welcomed by media and general public and supported by local municipal office as well as the temple. However the plan caused concerns to local people around Phra Pathommachedi which located in the city center and near city central fresh market. Fearing that if Phra Pathommachedi becomes World Heritage Site, the market may have to relocate and the whole community may affect from management plan of UNESCO, locals started to protest the plan. In 2011, Department of Fine Arts organized the public hearings in Phra Pathommachedi Temple on World Heritage Site nomination, by vote only 3 persons from 200 supported the nomination.\n\n==Geography==\nPhra Pathommachedi Stupa and surrounding temple are located on the flat [[floodplain]] of [[Chao Phraya River|Chao Phraya]] - [[Tha Chin River|Tha Chin]] rivers watershed. The land of temple has been filled up and the sewerage system has been created, but the temple complex still floods occasionally after heavy rain especially the grass fields around the stupa. In 1996 the temple grass fields have been cemented to prevent flood.\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe design of Phra Pathommachedi complex, when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant Buddhist [[mandala]], simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology with Phra Pathommachedi in the center.\n\n===Phra Pathommachedi===\nPhra Pathommachedi is the tallest stupa in Thailand, standing at 120.45 meters and with circumference of 235.50 meters. The current form of Pathommachedi is bell shape Sri Lanka styled brick stupa covered by golden brown colour [[tile]]s. The structure foundation of the stupa is timbers strapped by gigantic metal chain. There is a gilded niche which installed Buddha image at the eastern direction. The stupa surrounds by inner boundary wall. then 562 meters round [[cloister]]. The cloister has inner and outer open galleries. Inner open gallery has ancient [[Khmer language]] inscriptions.

Between the cloister and outer boundary wall has 24 belfries.\n\n===Northern Vihara===\nOriginally called Viharn Prasuth ({{lang|th|\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e15\u0e34}}), built by Mongkut in 1861. In 1900 after the construction of railway from [[Bangkok]] to [[Nakhon Pathom]] and Nakhon Pathom railway station in the north of Phra Pathommachedi, the Northern [[Vihara]] has become the main entrance to Phra Pathommachedi. [[Saovabha Phongsri]] built two levels grand staircase in front of the vihara as an entrance to the stupa complex in 1906. In 1913, [[Vajiravudh]] appointed [[Narisara Nuwattiwong]], a notable Thai architect and a prince, to redesign the vihara to install the {{convert|7.2|m}} Phra Ruang Rojanarit Sri Indraditya Dhammobhas Mahavajiravudhraj Pujaneeya Bophitr ({{lang|th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07\u0e42\u0e23\u0e08\u0e19\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c \u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e17\u0e34\u0e15\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e42\u0e21\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2a \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1b\u0e39\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e15\u0e23}}).<ref>http://npt.onab.go.th/papathom/papathom.pdf</ref> The beautiful new T-shaped vihara with [[apse]] liked [[portico]] in the front was completed in 1915 and has been called Viharn Phra Ruang ({{lang|th|\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07}}) after since.

The temple belongs to [[Maha Nikaya]] sect of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s in Thailand. The temple was found around the year 325 BCE before the construction of Phra Pathommachedi. [[Mongkut]] revived the temple in 1853 as a part of Phra Pathommachedi restoration plan. The total area of the temple is approximately 0.25 Square Kilometre. Originally the monastic area was located in the area of present-day lower terrace in front of Southern Vihara. [[Mongkut]] built the new monastic area in front of Northern Vihara with 25 living buildings, a sermon hall and a dining hall.

Its current exhibition presents the history of the province and consists of three sections. Zone 1 starts with an introduction to present-day Nakhon Pathom, including its geography, economy and demography. This is followed by its history. Visitors will see evidence of prehistoric dwellers found in the area, dating back 2,000-3,000 years. Zone 2 of the museum focuses on beliefs and religions through art mostly related to Buddhism - the main faith of [[Dvaravati]] culture. Zone 3 showcases the history and development of Nakhon Pathom during the Rattanakosin period. Objects on view include a model of Pathom Nakhon Palace, the residence of king [[Mongkut]] during his visit to [[Nakhon Pathom]], and Buddha images found at Phra Pathommachedi as well as a model of present-day Nakhon Pathom town. The highlights are models of Phra Pathommachedi, whose shape has been altered several times since the [[Dvaravati]] period.<ref>http://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/25982_info_phra-pathom-chedi-national-museum.html</ref>\n\n==Phra Pathommachedi in Literature==\nSince Phra Pathommachedi has become an important destination for [[pilgrimage]], many poets wrote poetries about the stupa.

Originally the stupa named Phra Thom Chedi means the big stupa in ancient [[Khmer language]] or the royal stupa in [[Northern Thai language]]. One of the common misunderstandings about this stupa is that Phra Pathommachedi is the oldest and the first stupa in [[Suvarnabhumi]], an ancient name of [[Southeast Asia]]. Modern Historians believe that the stupa was one of the principal stupas of ancient Nakhon Pathom, the largest settlement of [[Dvaravati]] culture in [[Nakhon Pathom]] area together with the nearby [[Phra Prathon Chedi]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e42\u0e17\u0e13\u0e40\u0e08\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c}}) during the 6th to the 8th centuries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Dvaravati Period===\n{{main|Dvaravati}}\nThe original of Phra Pathommachedi has no historical record, but according to [[:fr:Subhadradis Diskul|Subhadradis Diskul]], a prominent Thai historian and archaeologist, [[Ashoka]], an Indian Emperor who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from circa 269 to 232 BCE, sent a prominent Buddhist monks to expand Buddhism in [[Suvarnabhumi]] including the area that is [[Nakhon Pathom]] in present day. A Buddhist temple, Wat Phra Pathom, had been established around the year 325 BCE, and the stupa had been built around the year 193 BCE.<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/30182414/Phra-Pathom-Chedi-is-the-oldest-Buddhist-monument-in-Thailand</ref> The original structure is believed to be similar with the Great Stupa in [[Sanchi]],<ref>http://www.tourismthailand.org/See-and-Do/Sights-and-Attractions-Detail/Phra-Pathom-Chedi--5111</ref> India, with a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of [[Gautama Buddha]] with a structure on the top of the stupa in the shape of a [[Chatra (umbrella)|chatra]] or parasol symbolising high rank. The stupa is first mentioned in [[Buddhist texts]] of the year 675, however archaeological findings date back to the 4th century. Modern Historians believe that the stupa was one of the principal stupas of ancient Nakhon Pathom, the largest settlement of Dvaravati culture together with the nearby [[Phra Prathon Chedi]] ({{lang|th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e42\u0e17\u0e13\u0e40\u0e08\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c}}) during the 6th to the 8th centuries.\n\n===Legend of Phaya Gong and Phaya Phan===\n\n[[Image:Phrapathomchedireplic06.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Replica of Phra Pathommachedi before restoration]]\n\nSince the origin of Phra Pathommachedi is unknown, there are many legends about the stupa construction. The most famous legend is the legend of Phraya Gong and Phraya Phan<ref name=\"Bangkok Magazine\">http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/phra-pathom.htm</ref> (Thai: \u0e15\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19). The story is about a king of [[Nakhon Chai Si]], Phraya Gong, who had a baby boy named Phan. The court astrologer predicted that Phan will commit [[fratricide]] in the future. Phraya Gong then abandoned Phan. The orphan baby had been unknowingly adopted by a childness woman named Granny Hom. Granny Hom raised Phan in [[Ratchaburi]], a [[vassal]] city state of Nakhon Chai Si. One day an elephant belonging to a lord from Ratchaburi was in rut and begun attacking people. Phan went to see the elephant and was able to subdue it. After the lord from Ratchaburi heard about heroic act of Phan, he adopted Phan as his son. Phan wanted to conquer Nakhon Chaisi of Phraya Gong, so he sent a letter to Phraya Gong for challenging him to a [[war elephant]] duel. Phan killed Phraya Gong becoming king Phraya Phan. According to an ancient custom, Phraya Phan demanded Phraya Gong's wife to become his queen. When the queen met Phraya Phan, she recognized him to be her son, and told him the truth. Shocked and fearful of the truth getting out, Phraya Phan executes Granny Hom. After realising that he committed [[Anantarika-karma|a great sin]] by killing both father and a person who raised him - Granny Hom. In the year 26 BCE, Phraya Phan consulted with a group of [[arhat]]s how to atone for his sin. The arhats recommended Phraya Phan to build a great stupa, one which is of great height that even a bird can not fly higher. Phraya Phan then built a Sri Lankan style stupa by using a very big [[gong]] and his bed as a foundation and put [[Buddha]]'s tooth relic inside. Hundreds of years later, the king of [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] wanted the big gong, so he ordered his men to dig the stupa's foundation; as a result, both gong and stupa then collapsed. The Bago king tried to rebuild the stupa, so he built a Khmer style stupa on the top of this old stupa, which was the stupa form until the reign of king [[Mongkut]].\n\n===Khmer Empire and Pagan Invasion===\n\nAfter [[Khmer Empire]] annexed [[Dvaravati]] settlements including ancient [[Nakhon Pathom]], in the 11th century, the stupa had been modified with a [[Architecture of Cambodia|Khmer style]] [[prang (architecture)|prang]] on the top of stupa. [[Anawrahta]] of [[Pagan Kingdom]] invaded and plundered ancient Nakhon Pathom. Then the city and the stupa had been abandoned and later overgrown by the jungle. According to No.2 Sukhothai Inscription, a prominent monk from [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] tried to rebuild Phra Pathommachedi, but none of the archaeological evidence support this claim. In 1548 [[Maha Chakkraphat]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] rebuilt the city and named [[Nakhon Chai Si]], but because of Phra Pathommachedi was far from the new city, the stupa was left in the jungle.\n\n===Mongkut Discovery===\n[[Image:Phra-Pathom-Chedi Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|Phra Pathommachedi in 1925]]\n\nIn 1831 under the reign of king [[Rama III]], his son, prince [[Mongkut]], as a [[bhikkhu|monk]], discovered the ruin of Phra Pathommachedi and visited several times. He requested royal approval to restore the stupa, but Rama III declined. In 1832 [[Sunthorn Phu]], a famous Thai poet, accompanied prince [[Pinklao|Chutamani]] on a visit to Phra Pathommachedi. After his [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation]], [[Mongkut]] rebuilt the stupa in the Sri Lankan style, covering the old stupa as well as the new temple. The new temple has four [[vihara]]s that used for Buddhist ceremonies as well as many storage buildings to keep artifacts that were found in the nearby area. Mongkut also built a palace named Pathom Nakorn Palace near Phra Pathommachedi. [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] mentioned the reason for building this palace in the book \u201cTamnaan Wang Gao\u201d (or Tales of the Old Palaces) that during the renovation of Phra Pathommachedi, it was inconvenient to come and go from Bangkok to Nakhon Pathom within a day, thus staying overnight was obligatory. Under the royal command of Mongkut, the palace was built near the stupa. The canals of [[Maha Sawat Canal|Mahasawas]] and [[Chedi Bucha Canal|Chedi Bucha]] were also dug to facilitate commuting by boat between Bangkok and Nakhon Pathom. After 17 years of construction, the stupa and temple were finished in 1870 in the reign of [[Chulalongkorn]]. Chulalongkorn added [[Belfry (architecture)|belfries]] and imported golden brown colour [[tile]]s from [[China]] to cover the whole stupa. The population of nearby [[Nakhon Chai Si District]] was ordered to move to the newly created city around Phra Pathommachedi.\n\n===Later Development===\nIn 1907 as a crown prince, [[Vajiravudh]], after visited Phra Pathommachedi for several times, he decided to build [[Sanam Chandra Palace]] in Nakhon Pathom. He recorded the miracle stories of Phra Pathommachedi as well as renovated the stupa complex. In 1911 he built the 7.20 metres Buddha image and named Phra Ruang Rojanarit Sri Indraditya Dhammobhas Mahavajiravudhraj Pujaneeya Bophitr ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07\u0e42\u0e23\u0e08\u0e19\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c \u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e17\u0e34\u0e15\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e42\u0e21\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2a \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1b\u0e39\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e15\u0e23}}) and installed in the front [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] of Phra Pathommachedi. The ashes of [[Vajiravudh]], his consort [[Suvadhana]], and his daughter [[Bejaratana]] are kept at Phra Pathommachedi. [[Prajadhipok]] rebuilt ordination hall. In 1940 [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] selected Phra Pathommachedi as the symbol in provincial [[Seal (emblem)|seal]].\n\n[[Image:Seal Nakhon Pathom.png|thumb|left|150px|Seal of Nakhon Pathom]]\n\nIn 1966, the temple abbot found several cracks inside the stupa. Ministry of Interior sent a group of experts to check the stupa. After nine years research, the experts group reported that the stupa was in critical state and needed urgent restoration. The restoration finished in 1981. In 2008 Phra Pathommachedi had been restored again to solve inside stupa [[moisture]] problem, the works done in 2012.\n\n===Giant Incense Incident===\nIn 1998 to celebrate the 84th birthday of Phra Ruang Buddha image, Wat Phra Pathommachedi constructed three giant [[incense]] sticks to be the biggest incense stick in the world in front of the Northern Vihara. On November 2, 1998, the incense collapsed immediately causing 5 deaths and 13 injuries.\n\n===World Heritage Site Nomination===\nIn 2009 [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]], Ministry of Culture announced a plan to promote Phra Pathommachedi to be [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] because of the stupa's long history and its significance on Buddhism expansion in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Dvaravati]] culture. Initially the government plan had been welcomed by media and general public and supported by local municipal office as well as the temple. However the plan caused concerns to local people around Phra Pathommachedi which located in the city center and near city central fresh market. Fearing that if Phra Pathommachedi becomes World Heritage Site, the market may have to relocate and the whole community may affect from management plan of UNESCO, locals started to protest the plan. In 2011, Department of Fine Arts organized the public hearings in Phra Pathommachedi Temple on World Heritage Site nomination, by vote only 3 persons from 200 supported the nomination.\n\n==Geography==\nPhra Pathommachedi Stupa and surrounding temple are located on the flat [[floodplain]] of [[Chao Phraya River|Chao Phraya]] - [[Tha Chin River|Tha Chin]] rivers watershed. The land of temple has been filled up and the sewerage system has been created, but the temple complex still floods occasionally after heavy rain especially the grass fields around the stupa. In 1996 the temple grass fields have been cemented to prevent flood.\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe design of Phra Pathommachedi complex, when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant Buddhist [[mandala]], simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology with Phra Pathommachedi in the center.\n\n===Phra Pathommachedi===\nPhra Pathommachedi is the tallest stupa in Thailand, standing at 120.45 meters and with circumference of 235.50 meters. The current form of Pathommachedi is bell shape Sri Lanka styled brick stupa covered by golden brown colour [[tile]]s. The structure foundation of the stupa is timbers strapped by gigantic metal chain. There is a gilded niche which installed Buddha image at the eastern direction. The stupa surrounds by inner boundary wall. then 562 meters round [[cloister]]. The cloister has inner and outer open galleries. Inner open gallery has ancient [[Khmer language]] inscriptions.

Each book contained two short stories or novellas, previously published in ''The New Yorker'', about members of the Glass family. These four stories were originally published between 1955 and 1959, and were the only ones Salinger had published since ''Nine Stories.''

His first new work in six years, the novella took up most of the June 19, 1965, issue of ''The New Yorker'', and was universally panned by critics.

D. California.' California's book is called ''[[60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye]]'', and appears to pick up the story of Salinger's protagonist Holden Caulfield. In Salinger's novel, Caulfield is 16 years old, wandering the streets of New York after being expelled from his private school; the California book features a 76-year-old man, \"Mr. C,\" musing on having escaped his nursing home. Salinger's New York literary agent Phyllis Westberg told Britain's ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'': \"The matter has been turned over to a lawyer\". The fact that little was known about Colting and the book was set to be published by a new publishing imprint called 'Windupbird Publishing' gave rise to speculation in literary circles that the whole thing might be a stunt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5413559/JD-Salinger-considers-legal-action-to-stop-The-Catcher-in-the-Rye-sequel.html |last=Sherwell |first=Philip |title=JD Salinger considers legal action to stop The Catcher in the Rye sequel |date=May 30, 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London}}</ref> District court judge [[Deborah A.

Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, ''At Home in the World: A Memoir'', was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author by dressing in a childlike manner, and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University|Yale]].

In her book, she described the harrowing control that Salinger had over her mother and dispelled many of the Salinger myths established by Ian Hamilton's book. One of Hamilton's arguments was that Salinger's experience with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] left him psychologically scarred, and that he was unable to deal with the traumatic nature of his war service. Margaret Salinger allowed that \"the few men who lived through [[Operation L\u00fcttich|Bloody Mortain]], a battle in which her father fought, were left with much to sicken them, body and soul\",<ref name=\"fiff\"/> but she also painted a picture of her father as a man immensely proud of his service record, maintaining his military haircut and service jacket, and moving about his compound (and town) in an old [[Jeep]].\n\nBoth Margaret Salinger and Maynard characterized the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies included ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958), ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in ''The Catcher in the Rye''), and the comedies of [[W.C. Fields]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and the [[Marx Brothers]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Margaret Salinger|2000|p=7}}</ref> Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16&nbsp;mm prints. Maynard wrote that \"he loves movies, not films\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Maynard|1998|p=94}}</ref> and Margaret Salinger argued that her father's \"worldview is, essentially, a product of the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie.\"<ref name=\"Salinger, M 2000. p. 195\"/> [[Lillian Ross (journalist)|Lillian Ross]], a staff writer for ''The New Yorker'' and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, \"Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with.

A few weeks after ''Dream Catcher'' was published, Margaret's brother [[Matt Salinger|Matt]] discredited the memoir in a letter to ''[[The New York Observer]]''. He disparaged his sister's \"gothic tales of our supposed childhood\" and stated: \"I can't say with any authority that she is consciously making anything up.

Coincidentally the film also stars [[Zooey Deschanel]] who was named after the character from Salinger's ''Franny and Zooey''.\n* Salinger is portrayed by [[Chris Cooper]] in [[James Steven Sadwith]]'s 2015 film ''[[Coming Through the Rye (film)|Coming Through the Rye]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Ashley|title=Chris Cooper Is J.D.

He quotes numerous lines from his works, bemoaning how ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' has become his only recognizable work. In humorous contrast to his real-life beliefs, this rendition of Salinger loves Hollywoo and ends up managing a [[Story within a story#Nested TV shows|game show,]] which he aptly names ''Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out''.\n* Salinger was portrayed by [[Nicholas Hoult]] in the 2017 film ''[[Rebel in the Rye]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Nicholas Hoult to play JD Salinger in new biopic|date=September 1, 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/01/nicholas-hoult-rebel-in-the-rye-jd-salinger|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* Salinger's name is mentioned in the title for [[The Wonder Years (band)|The Wonder Years]] song \"[[You're Not Salinger.

D. Salinger works including ''Catcher in the Rye'', ''The Laughing Man'' and ''A Perfect Day for Banana Fish''.\n* The 2018 anime series [[Banana Fish]] displays themes found in ''A Perfect Day for Banana Fish'', and protagonist Ash Lynx mirrors [[Seymour Glass]]. Other references to Salinger's work are found in [[List of Banana Fish episodes|episode titles]]; episode 1 is titled \"A Perfect Day for Banana Fish\" and episode 24 is titled \"The Catcher in the Rye\".\n* ''[[Salinger (film)|Salinger]]'' is a 2013 [[documentary film]] that tells the story of Salinger's life through interviews with friends, historians, and journalists.\n* [[My Salinger Year]] is a film for release in 2020, based on the 2014 memoir by [[Joanna Rakoff]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|last=Mueller |first=Bruce F. |author2=Hochman, Will|title=Critical Companion to J.

In 1948, his critically acclaimed story \"[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]\" appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which became home to much of his later work. \n\n''The Catcher in the Rye'' was published in 1951 and became an immediate popular success. Salinger's depiction of [[Adolescence|adolescent]] [[Social alienation|alienation]] and loss of innocence in the protagonist [[Holden Caulfield]] was influential, especially among adolescent readers.<ref name=\"sonny\">{{Cite news|last=Skow |first=John |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938775,00.html |title=Sonny: An Introduction |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 15, 1961 |accessdate=April 12, 2007}}</ref> The novel was widely read and controversial.{{efn|See Beidler's ''A Reader's Companion to J.

He followed ''Catcher'' with a short story collection, ''[[Nine Stories (Salinger)|Nine Stories]]'' (1953); a volume containing a novella and a short story, ''[[Franny and Zooey]]'' (1961); and a volume containing two novellas, ''[[Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters]]'' and ''[[Seymour: An Introduction]]'' (1963). His last published work, a novella entitled \"[[Hapworth 16, 1924]],\" appeared in ''The New Yorker'' on June 19, 1965. Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal battle in the 1980s with biographer [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] and the release in the late 1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: [[Joyce Maynard]], an ex-lover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:1133 Park Avenue cloudy jeh.jpg|thumb|right|1133 Park Avenue in Manhattan, where Salinger grew up]]\nJerome David Salinger was born in [[Manhattan]], New York on January 1, 1919.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/jd-salinger-salinger-timeline/2838/|title=JD Salinger {{!}} Timeline of Major Events {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=January 16, 2014|website=American Masters|language=en-US|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref> His father, Sol Salinger, sold [[Kosher foods|kosher]] cheese, and was from a Jewish family of Lithuanian descent,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aronoff.com/family/i0004005.htm#i4005 |title=The Genealogy of Richard L.

Each book contained two short stories or novellas, previously published in ''The New Yorker'', about members of the Glass family. These four stories were originally published between 1955 and 1959, and were the only ones Salinger had published since ''Nine Stories.''

In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Software developer [[Peter Norton]] bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.<ref name=\"auction\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9906/22/salinger.letters/ |title=Salinger letters bring $156,500 at auction |publisher=CNN |date=June 22, 1999 |accessdate=April 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dream Catcher (memoir).jpg|thumb|upright|Margaret Salinger's memoir ''Dream Catcher'', its cover featuring a rare photograph of Salinger and Margaret as a child]]\nA year later, Salinger's daughter Margaret, by his second wife Claire Douglas, published ''Dream Catcher: A Memoir''. In her book, she described the harrowing control that Salinger had over her mother and dispelled many of the Salinger myths established by Ian Hamilton's book. One of Hamilton's arguments was that Salinger's experience with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] left him psychologically scarred, and that he was unable to deal with the traumatic nature of his war service. Margaret Salinger allowed that \"the few men who lived through [[Operation L\u00fcttich|Bloody Mortain]], a battle in which her father fought, were left with much to sicken them, body and soul\",<ref name=\"fiff\"/> but she also painted a picture of her father as a man immensely proud of his service record, maintaining his military haircut and service jacket, and moving about his compound (and town) in an old [[Jeep]].\n\nBoth Margaret Salinger and Maynard characterized the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies included ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958), ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in ''The Catcher in the Rye''), and the comedies of [[W.C. Fields]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and the [[Marx Brothers]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Margaret Salinger|2000|p=7}}</ref> Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16&nbsp;mm prints. Maynard wrote that \"he loves movies, not films\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Maynard|1998|p=94}}</ref> and Margaret Salinger argued that her father's \"worldview is, essentially, a product of the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie.\"<ref name=\"Salinger, M 2000. p. 195\"/> [[Lillian Ross (journalist)|Lillian Ross]], a staff writer for ''The New Yorker'' and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, \"Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved [[Anne Bancroft]], hated [[Audrey Hepburn]], and said that he had seen ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|Grand Illusion]]'' ten times.)\"<ref name=\"Ross2010\" />\n\nMargaret also offered many insights into other Salinger myths, including her father's supposed long-time interest in [[macrobiotics]], and involvement with \"alternative medicine\" and Eastern philosophies. A few weeks after ''Dream Catcher'' was published, Margaret's brother [[Matt Salinger|Matt]] discredited the memoir in a letter to ''[[The New York Observer]]''. He disparaged his sister's \"gothic tales of our supposed childhood\" and stated: \"I can't say with any authority that she is consciously making anything up. I just know that I grew up in a very different house, with two very different parents from those my sister describes.\"<ref name=\"justice\">{{Cite news|last=Malcolm |first=Janet |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14272 |title=Justice to J.

His death was ruled a [[suicide by hanging|suicide]]. Hernandez's attorneys successfully requested that his murder conviction be [[vacated judgment|vacated]] due to the legal principle of abatement ''ab initio'': if a convicted criminal has not exhausted all legal appeals at the time of his death, a guilty verdict may be officially vacated. His conviction was reinstated in 2019 following an appeal from [[prosecutor]]s and the Lloyd family.\n\nAfter being convicted in the Lloyd murder, Hernandez was accused of the 2012 shooting deaths of Boston residents Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado. Attorney [[Jose Baez (lawyer)|Jose Baez]] represented Hernandez in the murder trial, which resulted in a not guilty verdict. Baez wrote in his 2018 book ''Unnecessary Roughness''<ref name=Baez2018>Baez, Jose with Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez and George Willis (2018). Unnecessary Roughness: Inside the Trial and Final Days of Aaron Hernandez. Hachette, 1602866074</ref> that he and Hernandez planned an appeal in the Lloyd case. Baez believed Hernandez made poor choices in associating with criminals, but was not a murderer. He noted that Hernandez did not flee the area after the Lloyd murder and was compliant with every police interview and warrant before his arrest. Baez contended an appeal had a strong chance of success, given what he characterized as weaknesses in the prosecution cases that were overlooked by the initial lawyers and Judge Garsh's comments during a bail hearing that Hernandez appeared to be guilty (a possible violation of [[presumption of innocence]]).\n\n== Timeline of events ==\n* July 16, 2012 \u2013 Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado are killed by gunshots fired into their vehicle in Boston's South End after leaving Cure Nightclub. Hernandez was later indicted for these murders, but acquitted at trial in April 2017. \n* February 13, 2013 \u2013 After leaving a strip club in Miami, Hernandez allegedly shot friend and drug dealer Alexander Bradley in the forehead, and dumped him in an industrial park off I-95 near Riviera Beach, in Palm Beach County, Florida. Bradley survived but lost his right eye. He filed a civil lawsuit against Hernandez for the shooting.  Prosecutors later claimed the incident was due to an argument over Bradley's knowledge of the 2012 homicides. In May 2015 Hernandez was indicted on witness intimidation charges in the Bradley shooting.\n* June 14, 2013 \u2013 Lloyd and Hernandez went together to Rumor Nightclub in Boston.  A witness claimed Hernandez appeared to be upset at Lloyd in the club that night and stormed out. Prosecutors suggested that Hernandez may have been upset at Lloyd for speaking to patrons associated with the victims in the 2012 shootings.\n*June 16, 2013 \u2013 At approximately 9:30&nbsp;p.m. Hernandez text messaged his friend, Ernest Wallace, asking him to drive up to North Attleborough, Massachusetts, along with Carlos Ortiz, from his home in Bristol, Connecticut.\n* June 17, 2013 \u2013 At 2:33&nbsp;a.m., surveillance footage shows Odin Lloyd leaving his home in the South End of Boston and getting into a silver [[Nissan Altima]] with Hernandez, Wallace, and Ortiz.\n* June 17, 2013 \u2013 From 3:07&nbsp;a.m. to 3:23&nbsp;a.m., Lloyd sent his last text messages, to his sister Shaquilla Thibou.

Approximately four minutes later, a car is shown driving back. Police say that Lloyd was fatally shot during the period in between. \n* June 17, 2013 \u2013 Around 5:30&nbsp;p.m., a jogger taking a shortcut home discovered a body in a gravel pit on John Dietsch Boulevard. Later in the evening, the news broke that a man had been murdered about 1&nbsp;mile from Hernandez's [[North Attleboro, Massachusetts]] home.\n* June 18, 2013 \u2013 Hernandez was identified as playing a role in the murder of the man, later revealed to be Odin Lloyd.\n* June 26, 2013 \u2013 Hernandez was arrested at his home after an arrest warrant was issued for him the previous day.

His death was ruled a [[suicide by hanging|suicide]]. Hernandez's attorneys successfully requested that his murder conviction be [[vacated judgment|vacated]] due to the legal principle of abatement ''ab initio'': if a convicted criminal has not exhausted all legal appeals at the time of his death, a guilty verdict may be officially vacated. His conviction was reinstated in 2019 following an appeal from [[prosecutor]]s and the Lloyd family.\n\nAfter being convicted in the Lloyd murder, Hernandez was accused of the 2012 shooting deaths of Boston residents Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado. Attorney [[Jose Baez (lawyer)|Jose Baez]] represented Hernandez in the murder trial, which resulted in a not guilty verdict. Baez wrote in his 2018 book ''Unnecessary Roughness''<ref name=Baez2018>Baez, Jose with Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez and George Willis (2018). Unnecessary Roughness: Inside the Trial and Final Days of Aaron Hernandez. Hachette, 1602866074</ref> that he and Hernandez planned an appeal in the Lloyd case. Baez believed Hernandez made poor choices in associating with criminals, but was not a murderer. He noted that Hernandez did not flee the area after the Lloyd murder and was compliant with every police interview and warrant before his arrest. Baez contended an appeal had a strong chance of success, given what he characterized as weaknesses in the prosecution cases that were overlooked by the initial lawyers and Judge Garsh's comments during a bail hearing that Hernandez appeared to be guilty (a possible violation of [[presumption of innocence]]).\n\n== Timeline of events ==\n* July 16, 2012 \u2013 Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado are killed by gunshots fired into their vehicle in Boston's South End after leaving Cure Nightclub. Hernandez was later indicted for these murders, but acquitted at trial in April 2017. \n* February 13, 2013 \u2013 After leaving a strip club in Miami, Hernandez allegedly shot friend and drug dealer Alexander Bradley in the forehead, and dumped him in an industrial park off I-95 near Riviera Beach, in Palm Beach County, Florida. Bradley survived but lost his right eye. He filed a civil lawsuit against Hernandez for the shooting.  Prosecutors later claimed the incident was due to an argument over Bradley's knowledge of the 2012 homicides.
