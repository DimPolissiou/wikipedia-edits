The Lofoten Islands were an important centre for the production of fish oil and [[glycerine]], used in the German war economy. The landings were carried out on 4 March 1941, by the men of [[No. 3 Commando]],  [[No. 4 Commando]], a [[Royal Engineers]] section and 52 men from the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]]. Supported by the 6th Destroyer Flotilla and two troop transports of the [[Royal Navy]], the force made an unopposed landing and generally continued to meet no opposition. The original plan was to avoid contact with German forces and inflict the maximum of damage to German-controlled industry. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some {{convert|3600|t|LT|abbr=on}} of oil and glycerine. The British experienced only one accident; an officer injuring himself with his own revolver and returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 loyal Norwegian volunteers and a number of [[Quisling regime]] collaborators.\n\nThrough naval gunfire and demolition parties, 18,000 tons of shipping were sunk. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an [[Enigma machine]] and its code books from the German [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Krebs''. German naval codes could be read at [[Bletchley Park]], providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid [[U-boat]] concentrations.{{sfn|West|2015|p=10}} In the aftermath, the evaluation of the operation differed, with the British, especially [[Winston Churchill]] and the [[Special Operations Executive]], deeming it a success. In the eyes of the British the main value of such actions was to tie up large German forces on occupation duties in Norway. [[Martin Linge]] and the other Norwegians involved were more doubtful of the value of such raids against the Norwegian coast but were not told of the value of the seized cryptographic information. Following Operation Claymore, the Norwegian special operations unit Norwegian Independent Company 1 was established for operations in Norway.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been expelled from Europe at the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] in 1940, the British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint chiefs of staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe and stated that \"...&nbsp;they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\".<ref name=has47>Haskew, pp. 47\u201348</ref> Lieutenant-Colonel [[Dudley Clarke]], had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]]. Dill, aware of Churchill's intentions, approved Clarke's proposal.<ref name=has47/> Three weeks later, the first commando raid\u2014[[Operation Collar (commando raid)|Operation Collar]]\u2014took place. The raiders failed to gather any intelligence or damage any German equipment; their only success was in killing two German sentries.<ref name=has47/>\n\nThe commandos came under the operational control of the [[Combined Operations Headquarters]]. The man initially selected as the commander was Admiral [[Roger Keyes]], a veteran of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] in the [[First World War]].<ref>Chappell, p. 6.</ref> In 1940, the call went out for volunteers from among the serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain and men of the disbanding divisional [[Independent Companies]], originally raised from [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions, which had seen service in Norway.{{efn|The 10 independent companies were raised from volunteers in second line Territorial Army divisions in April 1940. They were intended for [[guerrilla]] operations in Norway, following the German invasion. Each of the 10 companies initially consisted of 21 officers and 268 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]].<ref>Moreman, p.13</ref>}} In November 1940, the new army units were organised into a [[special Service Brigade|special service brigade]] under [[Brigadier]] J.C.

Once at the islands, the raiders would be landed at four small ports to destroy fish oil-producing factories. All the oil produced was being shipped to Germany, which extracted the glycerine, a vital ingredient in the manufacture of high explosives.<ref name=ch12>Chappel, p. 12</ref> The commandos would be transported to the islands aboard two new [[Landing Ship, Infantry|infantry landing ships]], escorted by four {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer|0||1936}} and one [[L and M-class destroyer|L-class destroyer]] of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla.<ref name=ch12/>\n\n==Mission==\n[[File:HMS Somali (F33).jpg|thumb|alt=Royal Navy ship moored at sea|{{HMS|Somali|F33|6}}, leader of the 6th Destroyer flotilla]]\nThe commander of the raid was Rear Admiral [[Louis Keppel Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=5 July 2010 |work=Imperial War Museum Collection Search|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]|title=The Royal Navy during the Second World War: A6801 (photograph)|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205185531}}</ref> The objectives of Operation Claymore were threefold. The Royal Navy were asked to safely escort the transports carrying the landing force to the islands and back. While there, they were to destroy or capture any German shipping or Norwegian shipping working for the Germans and provide [[naval gunfire]] support for the landing forces. The naval forces taking part were the escorts from the 6th Destroyer Flotilla: {{HMS|Somali|F33|6}}, {{HMS|Bedouin|F67|2}}, {{HMS|Tartar|F43|2}}, {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|2}} and {{HMS|Legion|G74|2}} under the command of Captain C.

C. Haydon). The commandos taking part were 250 all ranks from [[No. 3 Commando]] (Major [[John Durnford-Slater]]), and 250 all ranks of [[No. 4 Commando]] (Lieutenant Colonel D. S. Lister). They were supported by a section of [[Royal Engineers]] of  No. 55 Field Company, (Second Lieutenant H. M. Turner) and four officers and 48 other ranks of the Norwegian Independent Company 1, (Captain [[Martin Linge]]).<ref name=gaz1/> The landing force were to destroy the oil-producing facilities in the ports of [[Stamsund]], [[Henningsv\u00e6r]], [[Svolv\u00e6r]] and [[Brettesnes]], engage the German garrison and attempt to take [[prisoners of war]] found in the area. They were also to detain any supporters of the Norwegian [[Quisling]] party and persuade the local population to leave the island and join the [[Free Norwegian Forces]].<ref name=gaz1/>\n\nThe force began its assembly at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] on 21 February 1941 and remained there for almost a week, before leaving for Norway just after midnight on 1 March 1941.

The Lofoten Islands were an important centre for the production of fish oil and [[glycerine]], used in the German war economy. The landings were carried out on 4 March 1941, by the men of [[No. 3 Commando]],  [[No. 4 Commando]], a [[Royal Engineers]] section and 52 men from the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]]. Supported by the 6th Destroyer Flotilla and two troop transports of the [[Royal Navy]], the force made an unopposed landing and generally continued to meet no opposition. The original plan was to avoid contact with German forces and inflict the maximum of damage to German-controlled industry. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some {{convert|3600|t|LT|abbr=on}} of oil and glycerine. The British experienced only one accident; an officer injuring himself with his own revolver and returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 loyal Norwegian volunteers and a number of [[Quisling regime]] collaborators.\n\nThrough naval gunfire and demolition parties, 18,000 tons of shipping were sunk. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an [[Enigma machine]] and its code books from the German [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Krebs''. German naval codes could be read at [[Bletchley Park]], providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid [[U-boat]] concentrations.{{sfn|West|2015|p=10}} In the aftermath, the evaluation of the operation differed, with the British, especially [[Winston Churchill]] and the [[Special Operations Executive]], deeming it a success. In the eyes of the British the main value of such actions was to tie up large German forces on occupation duties in Norway. [[Martin Linge]] and the other Norwegians involved were more doubtful of the value of such raids against the Norwegian coast but were not told of the value of the seized cryptographic information. Following Operation Claymore, the Norwegian special operations unit Norwegian Independent Company 1 was established for operations in Norway.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been expelled from Europe at the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] in 1940, the British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint chiefs of staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe and stated that \"...&nbsp;they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\".<ref name=has47>Haskew, pp. 47\u201348</ref> Lieutenant-Colonel [[Dudley Clarke]], had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]]. Dill, aware of Churchill's intentions, approved Clarke's proposal.<ref name=has47/> Three weeks later, the first commando raid\u2014[[Operation Collar (commando raid)|Operation Collar]]\u2014took place. The raiders failed to gather any intelligence or damage any German equipment; their only success was in killing two German sentries.<ref name=has47/>\n\nThe commandos came under the operational control of the [[Combined Operations Headquarters]]. The man initially selected as the commander was Admiral [[Roger Keyes]], a veteran of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] in the [[First World War]].<ref>Chappell, p. 6.</ref> In 1940, the call went out for volunteers from among the serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain and men of the disbanding divisional [[Independent Companies]], originally raised from [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions, which had seen service in Norway.{{efn|The 10 independent companies were raised from volunteers in second line Territorial Army divisions in April 1940.

Once at the islands, the raiders would be landed at four small ports to destroy fish oil-producing factories. All the oil produced was being shipped to Germany, which extracted the glycerine, a vital ingredient in the manufacture of high explosives.<ref name=ch12>Chappel, p. 12</ref> The commandos would be transported to the islands aboard two new [[Landing Ship, Infantry|infantry landing ships]], escorted by four {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer|0||1936}} and one [[L and M-class destroyer|L-class destroyer]] of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla.<ref name=ch12/>\n\n==Mission==\n[[File:HMS Somali (F33).jpg|thumb|alt=Royal Navy ship moored at sea|{{HMS|Somali|F33|6}}, leader of the 6th Destroyer flotilla]]\nThe commander of the raid was Rear Admiral [[Louis Keppel Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=5 July 2010 |work=Imperial War Museum Collection Search|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]|title=The Royal Navy during the Second World War: A6801 (photograph)|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205185531}}</ref> The objectives of Operation Claymore were threefold. The Royal Navy were asked to safely escort the transports carrying the landing force to the islands and back.

They were supported by a section of [[Royal Engineers]] of  No. 55 Field Company, (Second Lieutenant H. M.
