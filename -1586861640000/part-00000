The year 1981 saw Comme des Gar\u00e7ons's debut show in Paris. Kawakubo's heavy use of black, as well as distressed fabrics and unfinished seams, were viewed negatively by French critics.<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/2004/style/020904/power/9.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040210030330/http://www.time.com/time/2004/style/020904/power/9.html |archivedate=10 February 2004 |title=Women in fashion \u2013 Rei Kawakubo |publisher=Time magazine |date=9 February 2004 |accessdate=30 June 2019 |author=Kate Betts |url-status=live }}</ref> Throughout the 1980s, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons's clothes often were associated with a 'distressed' and 'punk' oriented style. Comme des Gar\u00e7ons continued to produce unusual styles through the 1990s, many of which were disliked by experts but by 2004 the company had grown ''Homme des Gar\u00e7ons Deux and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Shirt'', are all handmade. This is because Comme des Gar\u00e7ons adamantly values the quality of hand-made garments, reflected in the more expensive price and longevity of their products. Play, the company's luxury casual streetwear line, is mainly produced in Japan, Spain, and Turkey, with France's Play factory still utilizing many hand-made procedures as opposed to Japan, Spain, and Turkey's production line factory. This is because France's factory also produces hand-made only lines, including ''Tricot Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Homme Plus Evergreen, and Junya Watanabe Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons''. It is believed that all [[fabric]]s are produced in Japan, but some China and Australia sold pieces are hand-finished in France for quality control purposes (distinguishable by the hand stitched heart emblem).

The 1997 spring-summer collection, often referred to the \"lumps and bumps\" collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments, led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between [[Rei Kawakubo]] and New York-based choreographer [[Merce Cunningham]] called \"Scenario\".

This is because Comme des Gar\u00e7ons adamantly values the quality of hand-made garments, reflected in the more expensive price and longevity of their products. Play, the company's luxury casual streetwear line, is mainly produced in Japan, Spain, and Turkey, with France's Play factory still utilizing many hand-made procedures as opposed to Japan, Spain, and Turkey's production line factory. This is because France's factory also produces hand-made only lines, including ''Tricot Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Homme Plus Evergreen, and Junya Watanabe Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons''. It is believed that all [[fabric]]s are produced in Japan, but some China and Australia sold pieces are hand-finished in France for quality control purposes (distinguishable by the hand stitched heart emblem).
