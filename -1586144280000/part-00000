Organized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), which had been created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], it was held in [[Athens]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], from 6 to 15 April 1896.\n\nFourteen nations and 241, all-male, athletes took part in the games. Participants were all European, or living in Europe, except for the [[United States at the 1896 Summer Olympics|United States team]]. Winners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal. Retroactively, the IOC has converted these to gold and silver and awarded bronze medals to third-placed athletes. Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals. The United States won the most gold medals, 11, host nation Greece won the most medals overall, 46. The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spyridon Louis]]. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four events. Over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek.\n\nAthens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organized by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894, during which the IOC was also created, because [[Greece]] was the birthplace of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The main venue was the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], where athletics and wrestling took place; other venues included the [[Neo Phaliron Velodrome]] for [[Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|cycling]], and the [[Zappeion]] for [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|fencing]]. The opening ceremony was held in the Panathenaic Stadium on 6 April, during which most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organizing committee, [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]], his father officially opened the Games. Afterward, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an [[Olympic Hymn]], composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]], with words by the poet [[Kostis Palamas]].\n\nThe 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the most significant international participation of any sporting event to that date. The [[Panathenaic Stadium]] overflowed with the most massive crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<ref name=\"Y153\">Young (1996), 153</ref> After the Games, Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures, including Greece's [[George I of Greece|King George]] and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] were already planned for Paris and, except for the [[1906 Intercalated Games|Intercalated Games of 1906]], the Olympics did not return to Greece until the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], 108 years later.\n\n== Reviving the Games ==\n\nDuring the 19th century, several small-scale sports festivals across Europe were named after the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The 1870 [[Zappas Olympics|Olympics]] at the Panathenaic stadium, which had been refurbished for the occasion, had an audience of 30,000 people.<ref>The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C.

Following his proposal's acceptance by the congress, a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen. Coubertin suggested that the Games be held concurrently with the 1900 [[World's Fair|Universal Exposition]] of Paris. Concerned that a six-year waiting period might lessen public interest, congress members opted instead to hold the inaugural Games in 1896. With a date established, members of the congress turned their attention to the selection of a host city. It remains a mystery of how Athens was finally chosen to host the inaugural Games. In the following years, both Coubertin and [[Demetrius Vikelas]] would offer recollections of the selection process that contradicted the official minutes of the congress. Most accounts hold that several members of Congress first proposed London as the location, but Coubertin dissented. After a brief discussion with Vikelas, who represented Greece, Coubertin suggested Athens. Vikelas made the Athens proposal official on 23 June, and since Greece had been the original home of the Olympics, the congress unanimously approved the decision. Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).<ref>Young (1996), 100\u2013105</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\n\nThe Greek public, media well received news that the Olympic Games would return to Greece, and [[Royal Family of Greece|royal family]]. According to Coubertin, \"the Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] learned with great pleasure that the Games would be inaugurated in Athens.\" Coubertin went on to confirm that, \"the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these games.\" Constantine later conferred more than that; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organizing committee.<ref>Young (1996), 108</ref>\n\nHowever, the country had financial troubles and was in political turmoil. The job of [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|prime minister]] alternated between [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] and [[Theodoros Deligiannis]] frequently during the last years of the 19th century. Because of this financial and political instability, both prime minister Trikoupis and [[Stephanos Dragoumis]], the president of the Zappas Olympic Committee, which had attempted to organize a series of national Olympiads, believed that Greece could not host the event.<ref>, Young (1996), 111\u2013118</ref> In late 1894, the organizing committee under [[Stephanos Skouloudis]] presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by Coubertin. They concluded the Games could not be held and offered their resignation. The total cost of the Games was 3,740,000 gold [[drachma]]s.<ref name=Zarnowski>Zarnowski (1992), 16\u201332</ref>\n\n[[File:Demetrius Vikelas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demetrius Vikelas]], the first president of the International Olympic Committee, was credited with the successful organization of the 1896 Games]]\n\nWith the prospect of reviving the Olympic games very much in doubt, Coubertin and Vikelas commenced a campaign to keep the Olympic movement alive. Their efforts culminated on 7 January 1895 when Vikelas announced that crown prince Constantine would assume the presidency of the organizing committee. His first responsibility was to raise funds necessary to host the Games. He relied on the patriotism of the Greek people to motivate them to provide the required finances.<ref>Young (1996)118. According to Young (2004), 153, \"Vikelas and the other Greeks did most of the work. Coubertin did very little.\"</ref> Constantine's enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public. This grassroots effort raised 330,000 drachmas. A special set of postage stamps were commissioned, the sale of which raised 400,000 drachmas. Ticket sales added 200,000 drachmas. At the request of Constantine, businessman [[George Averoff]] agreed to pay for the restoration of the Panathenaic Stadium. Averoff would donate 920,000 drachmas<ref name=\"Young\" /> to this project.<ref>Darling (2004), 135</ref> As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium.

A designated [[Olympic Village]] for the athletes did not appear until the [[1932 Summer Olympics]]. Consequently, the athletes had to provide their lodging.\n\nThe first regulation voted on by the new IOC in 1894 was to allow only amateur athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.<ref>Some scholars allege that during the Sorbonne congress Coubertin was led by tactical considerations, and used the amateur requirement only as a bait to realize his actual aim\u2014namely the reintroduction of the Olympic Games\u2014more quickly (Lennartz\u2013Wassong [2004]), 20.</ref> The various contests were thus held under amateur regulations except for fencing matches.<ref>Professionalism vs. amateurism was one of the dominant themes of the 19th century regarding athletics. In Greece, the amateurism of athletes debate was taken a step further to encompass the question of the participation of the lower classes in the Games. In 1870, during the Zappian Olympic Games, Philippos Ioannou, a classical scholar, and professor criticized the games and attacked the ideal of amateurism. He contended that they were a parody because people from the working class had taken part in the games. Ioannou suggested that only young people from the upper class should be accepted in the following Olympiad ([http://www.fhw.gr/olympics/ancient/en/304b.html Professionals and Amateurs], Foundation of the Hellenic World).</ref> The rules and regulations were not uniform, so the Organising Committee had to choose among the codes of the various national athletic associations. The jury, the referees, and the game director bore the same names as in antiquity (''Ephor'', ''Helanodic'' and ''Alitarc''). [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]] acted as a final referee; according to Coubertin, \"his presence gave weight and authority to the decisions of the ephors.\"<ref name=\"C46-47\">Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&tif=00057.TIF&pagenum=46 46\u201347]</ref>\n\nWomen were not entitled to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics, because de Coubertin felt that their inclusion would be \"impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and incorrect.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/women.htm|title=Women at the Olympic Games|date=|work=topendsports.com|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Venues ==\n[[File:Panathinaiko Stadium panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]\n\nSeven venues were used for the 1896 Summer Olympics.

Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organizing committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games with the words (in [[Modern Greek|Greek]]):<ref name=\"IOCA\">[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1896 Athens 1896&nbsp;\u2013 Games of the I Olympiad], International Olympic Committee</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens.

Long live the Greek people.\"</blockquote>\n\nAfterward, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an [[Olympic Hymn]], composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]], with words by the poet [[Kostis Palamas]]. After that, a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], since which time the Samaras/Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem (decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958). Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were initiated later: the [[Olympic flame]] was first lit in [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the first athletes' oath was sworn at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], and the first officials' oath was taken at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]].<ref name=\"IOCA\" />\n\n== Events ==\n\nAt the 1894 Sorbonne Congress, a large roster of sports was suggested for the program in Athens.

The competition was held at the courts of the [[Athens Lawn Tennis Club]], and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events. [[John Pius Boland]], who won the event, had been entered in the competition by a fellow-student of his at Oxford; the Greek, Konstantinos Manos. As a member of the Athens Lawn Tennis sub-committee, Manos had been trying, with the assistance of Boland, to recruit competitors for the Athens Games from among the sporting circles of Oxford University. In the first round, Boland defeated [[Friedrich Traun]], a promising tennis player from [[Hamburg]], who had been eliminated in the 100-meter sprint competition. Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event, in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set.<ref>Gillmeister (1995), 23\u201324</ref>\n\n=== Weightlifting ===\n{{Main|Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\n[[File:Launceston Elliot.jpg|thumb|[[Launceston Elliot]], winner of the one-armed weightlifting event, was popular with the Greek audience, who found him very handsome]]\n\nThe sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896, and the rules differed from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the [[Panathenaic Stadium|main stadium]], and there were no weight limits. The first event was held in style, now known as the \"[[clean and jerk]].\" Two competitors stood out: Scotsman [[Launceston Elliot]] and [[Viggo Jensen]] of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight, but the jury, with Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, protested. The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.<ref name=\"C70-71\">Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 70\u201371</ref>\n\nElliot got his revenge in the [[Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's one-hand lift|one hand lift]] event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two-handed attempt and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily. The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor, whom they considered very attractive. A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event: a servant was ordered to remove the weights, which appeared to be a difficult task for him. Prince George came to his assistance; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease, to the delight of the crowd.<ref name=\"C70-71\" />\n\n=== Wrestling ===\n{{Main|Wrestling at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\n[[File:Schuhmann lotta atene 1896.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Schuhmann]] (left) and [[Georgios Tsitas]] shake hands before the final match of the wrestling competition]]\n\nNo weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathenaic Stadium, which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds forbidden (in contrast to current rules).\n\nApart from the two Greek contestants, all the competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion [[Carl Schuhmann]]. The latter won and advanced into the final, where he met [[Georgios Tsitas]], who had previously defeated [[Stephanos Christopoulos]]. Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes; it was continued the following day when Schuhmann needed only fifteen minutes to finish the bout.<ref>Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 93\u201394</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Closing ceremony ==\n[[File:1896 Olympic medal.jpg|thumb|275px|A silver medal was awarded to the winner of each event. The current system of gold, silver, and bronze medals was not implemented until the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Olympic Games]].]]\nOn the morning of Sunday, 12 April (or 3 April, according to the Julian calendar then used in Greece), King George the Great organized a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions had not yet been held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently. The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday, after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the [[national anthem of Greece]] and an ode composed in [[ancient Greek]] by [[George S. Robertson]], a British athlete and scholar.<ref name=\"C50\">Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&tif=00059.TIF&pagenum=50 50]</ref>\n\nAfterward, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the first-place winners received a silver medal, an [[olive]] branch, and a diploma, while runners-up received a copper medal, a [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch, and diploma.<ref name=\"official report\">Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 232\u2013234</ref><ref>IOC Olympic Museum exhibition panel, 2010</ref> Third place winners did not receive a prize.\n\nSome winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from [[Michel Br\u00e9al]], a friend of Coubertin, who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honor around the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end, and left the Stadium, while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered.<ref name=\"C50\" />\n\nLike the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in Paris, although they would be somewhat overshadowed by the concurrently held [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition]].<ref>Young (1996), 156</ref>\n\n== Participating nations ==\n\n[[File:1896 Olympic games countries.PNG|thumb|Participating countries]]\n\nThe concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until the [[1906 Intercalated Games|Intercalated Games]] 10 years later, though many sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts. There are significant conflicts with regard to which nations competed. The International Olympic Committee gives a figure of 14, but does not list them.<ref name=\"IOCA\" /> The following 14 are most likely the ones recognised by the IOC. Some sources list 12, excluding Chile and Bulgaria; others list 13, including those two but excluding Italy. Egypt is also sometimes included because of [[Dionysios Kasdaglis]]' participation.

Organised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), which had been created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], it was held in [[Athens]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], from 6 to 15 April 1896.\n\nFourteen nations and 241, all male, athletes took part in the games. Participants were all European, or living in Europe, with the exception of the [[United States at the 1896 Summer Olympics|United States team]]. Winners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal. Retroactively, the IOC has converted these to gold and silver, and awarded bronze medals to third placed athletes. Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals. The United States won the most gold medals, 11, host nation Greece won the most medals overall, 46. The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spyridon Louis]]. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four events. Over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek.\n\nAthens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894, during which the IOC was also created, because [[Greece]] was the birthplace of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The main venue was the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], where athletics and wrestling took place; other venues included the [[Neo Phaliron Velodrome]] for [[Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|cycling]], and the [[Zappeion]] for [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|fencing]]. The opening ceremony was held in the Panathenaic Stadium on 6 April, during which most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]], his father officially opened the Games. Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an [[Olympic Hymn]], composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]], with words by poet [[Kostis Palamas]].\n\nThe 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The [[Panathenaic Stadium]] overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<ref name=\"Y153\">Young (1996), 153</ref> After the Games, Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures, including Greece's [[George I of Greece|King George]] and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] were already planned for Paris and, except for the [[1906 Intercalated Games|Intercalated Games of 1906]], the Olympics did not return to Greece until the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], 108 years later.\n\n== Reviving the Games ==\n\nDuring the 19th century, several small-scale sports festivals across Europe were named after the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The 1870 [[Zappas Olympics|Olympics]] at the Panathenaic stadium, which had been refurbished for the occasion, had an audience of 30,000 people.<ref>The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, Chapter 4</ref> [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[Pedagogy|pedagogue]] and historian, adopted Dr [[William Penny Brookes]]' idea to establish a multi-national and [[multi-sport event]]\u2014the ancient games only allowed male athletes of Greek origin to participate.<ref>Bijkerk (2004), 457</ref><ref>Toohey (2007), 20</ref> In 1890, Coubertin wrote an article in ''La Revue Athletique'', which espoused the importance of [[Much Wenlock]] a rural market town in the English county of [[Shropshire]]. It was here that, in October 1850, the local physician William Penny Brookes had founded the [[Wenlock Olympian Games]], a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports, such as [[cricket]], [[association football|football]] and [[quoits]].<ref>Mullins, \"Pierre de Coubertin and the Wenlock Olympian Games\"</ref> Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organised under the name of [[Zappas Olympics|Olympics]] by businessman and philanthropist [[Evangelis Zappas]] in 1859, 1870 and 1875.<ref>Matthews (2005), 66; Young (1996), 81</ref> The 1896 Athens Games were funded by the legacies of [[Evangelis Zappas]] and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]]<ref>Young (1996), p.117</ref><ref>Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa \u2013 Athens 1893, by F.

This the Greek government did despite the fact that the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble had already been funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.<ref>Young (1996), p.14</ref>\n\n{{quote|quote=With deep feeling towards Baron de Coubertin's courteous petition, I send him and the members of the Congress, with my sincere thanks, my best wishes for the revival of the Olympic Games.|source=[[George I of Greece|King George]] of Greece (21 June 1894)<ref>Young (1996), 102</ref>}}\n\nOn 18 June 1894, Coubertin organised a congress at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], Paris, to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries. Following his proposal's acceptance by the congress, a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen. Coubertin suggested that the Games be held concurrently with the 1900 [[World's Fair|Universal Exposition]] of Paris. Concerned that a six-year waiting period might lessen public interest, congress members opted instead to hold the inaugural Games in 1896. With a date established, members of the congress turned their attention to the selection of a host city. It remains a mystery how Athens was finally chosen to host the inaugural Games. In the following years both Coubertin and [[Demetrius Vikelas]] would offer recollections of the selection process that contradicted the official minutes of the congress. Most accounts hold that several congressmen first proposed London as the location, but Coubertin dissented. After a brief discussion with Vikelas, who represented Greece, Coubertin suggested Athens. Vikelas made the Athens proposal official on 23 June, and since Greece had been the original home of the Olympics, the congress unanimously approved the decision. Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).<ref>Young (1996), 100\u2013105</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\n\nNews that the Olympic Games would return to Greece was well received by the Greek public, media, and [[Royal Family of Greece|royal family]]. According to Coubertin, \"the Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] learned with great pleasure that the Games will be inaugurated in Athens.\" Coubertin went on to confirm that, \"the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these games.\" Constantine later conferred more than that; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organising committee.<ref>Young (1996), 108</ref>\n\nHowever, the country had financial troubles and was in political turmoil. The job of [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|prime minister]] alternated between [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] and [[Theodoros Deligiannis]] frequently during the last years of the 19th century. Because of this financial and political instability, both prime minister Trikoupis and [[Stephanos Dragoumis]], the president of the Zappas Olympic Committee, which had attempted to organise a series of national Olympiads, believed that Greece could not host the event.<ref>Young (1996), 111\u2013118</ref> In late 1894, the organising committee under [[Stephanos Skouloudis]] presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by Coubertin. They concluded the Games could not be held, and offered their resignation. The total cost of the Games was 3,740,000 gold [[drachma]]s.<ref name=Zarnowski>Zarnowski (1992), 16\u201332</ref>\n\n[[File:Demetrius Vikelas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demetrius Vikelas]], the first president of the International Olympic Committee, was credited with the successful organisation of the 1896 Games]]\n\nWith the prospect of reviving the Olympic games very much in doubt, Coubertin and Vikelas commenced a campaign to keep the Olympic movement alive. Their efforts culminated on 7 January 1895 when Vikelas announced that crown prince Constantine would assume the presidency of the organising committee. His first responsibility was to raise the funds necessary to host the Games. He relied on the patriotism of the Greek people to motivate them to provide the required finances.<ref>Young (1996), 118. According to Young (2004), 153, \"Vikelas and the other Greeks did most of the work. Coubertin did very little.\"</ref> Constantine's enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public. This grassroots effort raised 330,000 drachmas. A special set of postage stamps were commissioned; the sale of which raised 400,000 drachmas. Ticket sales added 200,000 drachmas. At the request of Constantine, businessman [[George Averoff]] agreed to pay for the restoration of the Panathenaic Stadium. Averoff would donate 920,000 drachmas<ref name=\"Young\" /> to this project.<ref>Darling (2004), 135</ref> As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium. It stands there to this day.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/04/101824945.pdf George Averoff Dead], New York Times</ref>\n\nSome of the athletes would take part in the Games because they happened to be in Athens at the time the Games were held, either on holiday or for work (e.g., some of the British competitors worked for the British [[diplomatic mission|embassy]]). A designated [[Olympic Village]] for the athletes did not appear until the [[1932 Summer Olympics]]. Consequently, the athletes had to provide their own lodging.\n\nThe first regulation voted on by the new IOC in 1894 was to allow only amateur athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.<ref>Some scholars allege that during the Sorbonne congress Coubertin was led by tactical considerations, and used the amateur requirement only as a bait in order to realize his actual aim\u2014namely the reintroduction of the Olympic Games\u2014more quickly (Lennartz\u2013Wassong [2004]), 20.</ref> The various contests were thus held under amateur regulations with the exception of fencing matches.<ref>Professionalism vs amateurism was one of the dominant themes of the 19th century regarding athletics. In Greece the amateurism of athletes debate was taken a step further to encompass the question of the participation of the lower classes in the Games. In 1870, during the Zappian Olympic Games, Philippos Ioannou, a classical scholar and professor, criticised the games, and attacked the ideal of amateurism. His contention was that they were a parody, because people from the working class had taken part in the games. Ioannou suggested that only young people from the upper class should be accepted in the following Olympiad ([http://www.fhw.gr/olympics/ancient/en/304b.html Professionals and Amateurs], Foundation of the Hellenic World).</ref> The rules and regulations were not uniform, so the Organising Committee had to choose among the codes of the various national athletic associations. The jury, the referees and the game director bore the same names as in antiquity (''Ephor'', ''Helanodic'' and ''Alitarc''). [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]] acted as final referee; according to Coubertin, \"his presence gave weight and authority to the decisions of the ephors.\"<ref name=\"C46-47\">Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&tif=00057.TIF&pagenum=46 46\u201347]</ref>\n\nWomen were not entitled to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics, because de Coubertin felt that their inclusion would be \"impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and incorrect\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/women.htm|title=Women at the Olympic Games|date=|work=topendsports.com|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Venues ==\n[[File:Panathinaiko Stadium panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]\n\nSeven venues were used for the 1896 Summer Olympics.

Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games with the words (in [[Modern Greek|Greek]]):<ref name=\"IOCA\">[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1896 Athens 1896&nbsp;\u2013 Games of the I Olympiad], International Olympic Committee</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens. Long live the Nation. Long live the Greek people.\"</blockquote>\n\nAfterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an [[Olympic Hymn]], composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]], with words by poet [[Kostis Palamas]]. Thereafter, a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], since which time the Samaras/Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem (decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958). Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were initiated later: the [[Olympic flame]] was first lit in [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the first athletes' oath was sworn at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], and the first officials' oath was taken at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]].<ref name=\"IOCA\" />\n\n== Events ==\n\nAt the 1894 Sorbonne congress, a large roster of sports were suggested for the program in Athens. The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/134962.html|title=The ignorant Olympians}}</ref> but these plans were never finalised, and these sports did not make the final list for the Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thread/sports/no-spot-the-olympics-its-not-cricket/article17949431.ece|title=No spot the Olympics?

The major highlight was the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's marathon|marathon]], held for the first time in international competition. [[Spyridon Louis]], a previously unrecognised water carrier, won the event to become the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero. Although Greece had been favoured to win the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's discus throw|discus]] and the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's shot put|shot put]], the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American [[Robert Garrett]] in both events.<ref name=\"Y153\" />\n\nNo [[world record]]s were set, as few top international competitors had elected to compete. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible. Despite this, [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]], of the United States, won the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100-meter]] race in 12.0 seconds and the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres|400-meter]] race in 54.2 seconds. Burke was the only one who used the \"[[crouch start]]\" (putting his knee on soil), confusing the jury. Eventually, he was allowed to start from this \"uncomfortable position\".<ref>Sears (2001), 159</ref>\n\n[[File:Masson flameng.jpg|thumb|right|Frenchmen [[L\u00e9on Flameng]] ''(left)'' and [[Paul Masson (cyclist)|Paul Masson]] won four cycling events]]\n\n[[File:Leonidas Pyrgos.jpg|thumb|Fencer [[Leonidas Pyrgos]] became the first Greek modern Olympic champion by winning the masters foil competition]]\n\n[[File:Schuhmann flatow weingartner.jpg|thumb|right|The German individual gymnastics champions: Schuhmann, [[Alfred Flatow|Flatow]], and [[Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner|Weing\u00e4rtner]]]]\n\n[[Chile]] claims one athlete, [[Luis Subercaseaux]], competed for the nation at the 1896 Summer Olympics.

Only one road event was held, a race from Athens to Marathon and back (87 kilometres).\n\nIn the track events, the best cyclist was Frenchman [[Paul Masson (cyclist)|Paul Masson]], who won the one lap [[time trial]], the sprint event, and the 10,000 meters. In the 100 kilometres event, Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot [[L\u00e9on Flameng]]. Flameng won the event, after a fall, and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent [[Georgios Kolettis]] to fix a mechanical problem. The Austrian fencer [[Adolf Schmal]] won the 12-hour race, which was completed by only two cyclists, while the road race event was won by [[Aristidis Konstantinidis]].<ref name=\"LW\">Lennartz-Wassong (2004), 23</ref>\n\n=== Fencing ===\n{{Main|Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe fencing events were held in the [[Zappeion]], which, built with money [[Evangelis Zappas]] had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games, had never seen any athletic contests before.<ref name=\"Y148\">Young (1996), 148</ref> Unlike other sports (in which only amateurs were allowed to take part at the Olympics), professionals were authorised to compete in fencing, though in a separate event. These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes, just as the amateurs.<ref name=\"C46-47\" />\n\nFour events were scheduled, but the [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]] event was cancelled for unknown reasons. The [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's foil|foil event]] was won by a Frenchman, [[Eug\u00e8ne-Henri Gravelotte]], who beat his countryman, [[Henri Callot]], in the final.<ref name=\"Y148\" /> The other two events, the [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sabre|sabre]] and the [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's masters foil|masters foil]], were won by Greek fencers. [[Leonidas Pyrgos]], who won the latter event, became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era.\n\n=== Gymnastics ===\n{{Main|Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe gymnastics competition was carried out on the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium. Germany had sent an 11-man team, which won five of the eight events, including both team events. In the team event on the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team horizontal bar|horizontal bar]], the German team was unopposed. Three Germans added individual titles: [[Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner]] won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's horizontal bar|horizontal bar event]], [[Alfred Flatow]] won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's parallel bars|parallel bars]]; and [[Carl Schuhmann]], who also competed successfully in wrestling, won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's vault|vault]]. [[Louis Zutter]], a Swiss gymnast, won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's pommel horse|pommel horse]], while Greeks [[Ioannis Mitropoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Andriakopoulos]] were victorious in the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's rings|rings]] and [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's rope climbing|rope climbing]] events, respectively.<ref>Young (1996), 151</ref>\n\n=== Sailing/Rowing ===\n[[File:BASA-3K-7-422-21-1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|German team at the 1896 Summer Olympics]]\nA regatta of sailing boats was on the program of the '''Games of the First Olympiad''' for 31 March 1896. However this event had to be given up.\n\nThe Official English report states:\n\n{{quote|quote=The Regatta could not take place because some special boats embarkation had not been provided for.|source=Charalambos Annino|The Olympic Games B.C. 776. \u2013 A.D. 1896<ref name=\"C98-99\" />}}\n\nThe German version gives a bit more clues:\n\n{{quote|quote=Die Wettk\u00e4mpfe im Segeln wurden vereitelt, da man weder bei uns die besonderen Boote daf\u00fcr besass, noch fremde Bewerber sich gemeldet hatten.

The first event, [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 metre military rifle|the military rifle]], was won by [[Pantelis Karasevdas]], the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots. The second event, for [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 25 metre military pistol|military pistols]], was dominated by two American brothers: [[John Paine (sharpshooter)|John]] and [[Sumner Paine]] became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event. To avoid embarrassing their hosts, the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event, the [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 30 metre free pistol|free pistol]]. Sumner Paine won that event, thereby becoming the first relative of an Olympic champion to become Olympic champion himself.<ref name=\"CP76,83\">Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 76, 83\u201384</ref>\n\nThe Paine brothers did not compete in the [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol|25-meter pistol event]], as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required calibre. In their absence, [[Ioannis Phrangoudis]] won. The final event, the [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 300 metre free rifle, three positions|free rifle]], began on the same day. However, the event could not be completed due to darkness and was finalised the next morning, when [[Georgios Orphanidis]] was crowned the champion.<ref name=\"CP76,83\" />\n\n=== Swimming ===\n{{Main|Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\n[[File:Hajos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfr\u00e9d Haj\u00f3s]], the first Olympic champion in swimming, is one of only two Olympians to have won medals in both sport and art competitions]]\n\nThe swimming competition was held in the open sea because the organizers had refused to spend the money necessary for a specially constructed stadium. Nearly 20,000 spectators lined the [[Bay of Zea]] off the [[Piraeus]] coast to watch the events. The water in the bay was cold, and the competitors suffered during their races. There were three open events ([[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|men's 100-metre freestyle]], [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 500 metre freestyle|men's 500-metre freestyle]], and [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1200 metre freestyle|men's 1200 metre freestyle]]), in addition to a [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sailors 100 metre freestyle|special event open only to Greek sailors]], all of which were held on the same day (11 April).<ref name=\"LW\" />\n\nFor [[Alfr\u00e9d Haj\u00f3s]] of Hungary, this meant he could only compete in two of the events, as they were held too close together, which made it impossible for him to adequately recuperate. Nevertheless, he won the two events in which he swam, the 100 and 1200 meter [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]]. Haj\u00f3s later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|artistic competitions]], when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924. The 500-meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer [[Paul Neumann (swimmer)|Paul Neumann]], who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half.\n\n=== Tennis ===\n{{Main|Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\nAlthough tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century, none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens. The competition was held at the courts of the [[Athens Lawn Tennis Club]], and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events. [[John Pius Boland]], who won the event, had been entered in the competition by a fellow-student of his at Oxford; the Greek, Konstantinos Manos. As a member of the Athens Lawn Tennis sub-committee, Manos had been trying, with the assistance of Boland, to recruit competitors for the Athens Games from among the sporting circles of Oxford University. In the first round, Boland defeated [[Friedrich Traun]], a promising tennis player from [[Hamburg]], who had been eliminated in the 100-meter sprint competition. Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event, in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set.<ref>Gillmeister (1995), 23\u201324</ref>\n\n=== Weightlifting ===\n{{Main|Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\n[[File:Launceston Elliot.jpg|thumb|[[Launceston Elliot]], winner of the one-armed weightlifting event, was popular with the Greek audience, who found him very handsome]]\n\nThe sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896, and the rules differed from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the [[Panathenaic Stadium|main stadium]], and there were no weight limits. The first event was held in a style now known as the \"[[clean and jerk]]\". Two competitors stood out: Scotsman [[Launceston Elliot]] and [[Viggo Jensen]] of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight; but the jury, with Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, lodged a protest. The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.<ref name=\"C70-71\">Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 70\u201371</ref>\n\nElliot got his revenge in the [[Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's one hand lift|one hand lift]] event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two-handed attempt, and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily. The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor, whom they considered very attractive. A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event: a servant was ordered to remove the weights, which appeared to be a difficult task for him. Prince George came to his assistance; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease, to the delight of the crowd.<ref name=\"C70-71\" />\n\n=== Wrestling ===\n{{Main|Wrestling at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}\n\n[[File:Schuhmann lotta atene 1896.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Schuhmann]] (left) and [[Georgios Tsitas]] shake hands before the final match of the wrestling competition]]\n\nNo weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathenaic Stadium, which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds were forbidden (in contrast to current rules).\n\nApart from the two Greek contestants, all the competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion [[Carl Schuhmann]]. The latter won and advanced into the final, where he met [[Georgios Tsitas]], who had previously defeated [[Stephanos Christopoulos]]. Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes; it was continued the following day, when Schuhmann needed only fifteen minutes to finish the bout.<ref>Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 93\u201394</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Closing ceremony ==\n[[File:1896 Olympic medal.jpg|thumb|275px|A silver medal was awarded to the winner of each event. The current system of gold, silver, and bronze medals was not implemented until the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Olympic Games]].]]\nOn the morning of Sunday 12 April (or 3 April, according to the Julian calendar then used in Greece), King George the Great organised a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions had not yet been held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently. The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday, after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the [[national anthem of Greece]] and an ode composed in [[ancient Greek]] by [[George S. Robertson]], a British athlete and scholar.<ref name=\"C50\">Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&tif=00059.TIF&pagenum=50 50]</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the first-place winners received a silver medal, an [[olive]] branch and a diploma, while runners-up received a copper medal, a [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch, and diploma.<ref name=\"official report\">Coubertin\u2013Philemon\u2013Politis\u2013Anninos (1897), 232\u2013234</ref><ref>IOC Olympic Museum exhibition panel, 2010</ref> Third place winners did not receive a prize.\n\nSome winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from [[Michel Br\u00e9al]], a friend of Coubertin, who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honour around the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end, and left the Stadium, while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered.<ref name=\"C50\" />\n\nLike the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in Paris, although they would be somewhat overshadowed by the concurrently held [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition]].<ref>Young (1996), 156</ref>\n\n== Participating nations ==\n\n[[File:1896 Olympic games countries.PNG|thumb|Participating countries]]\n\nThe concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until the [[1906 Intercalated Games|Intercalated Games]] 10 years later, though many sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts. There are significant conflicts with regard to which nations competed. The International Olympic Committee gives a figure of 14, but does not list them.<ref name=\"IOCA\" /> The following 14 are most likely the ones recognised by the IOC. Some sources list 12, excluding Chile and Bulgaria; others list 13, including those two but excluding Italy. Egypt is also sometimes included because of [[Dionysios Kasdaglis]]' participation.

Typical [[memorabilia]] include photographs, printed media, and artwork. Scrapbook albums are often decorated and frequently contain extensive [[Diary|journal entries]] or written descriptions. Scrapbooking started in the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century.\n\n== History ==\nIn the 15th century, [[commonplace book]]s, popular in England, emerged as a way to compile information that included recipes, quotations, letters, poems and more. Each commonplace book was unique to its creator's particular interests. Friendship albums became popular in the 16th century. These albums were used much like modern day [[yearbooks]], where friends or patrons would enter their names, titles and short texts or illustrations at the request of the album's owner. These albums were often created as souvenirs of European tours and would contain local memorabilia including coats of arms or works of art commissioned by local artisans.<ref name=\"Katritzky, M. A. 2006\">Katritzky, M. A., \"The Art of Commedia: A Study in the Commdia Dell'Arte 1560-1620 with Special Reference to the Visual Records\", 2006, Rodopi Publishing</ref> Starting in 1570, it became fashionable to incorporate colored plates depicting popular scenes such as Venetian costumes or Carnival scenes. These provided affordable options as compared to original works and, as such, these plates were not sold to commemorate or document a specific event, but specifically as embellishments for albums.<ref name=\"Katritzky, M. A. 2006\"/> In 1775, [[James Granger]] published a history of England with several blank pages at the end of the book. The pages were designed to allow the book's owner to personalize the book with his own memorabilia.<ref name=\"Tucker, S. 2006\">Tucker, S., Ott, K., Buckler, P., \"The Scrapbook in American Life\", 2006, Temple University Press</ref> The practice of pasting engravings, lithographs and other illustrations into books, or even taking the books apart, inserting new matter, and rebinding them, became known as [[extra-illustration|extra-illustrating]] or ''grangerizing''.<ref name=\"Tucker, S. 2006\"/> Additionally, friendship albums and school yearbooks afforded girls in the 18th and 19th centuries an outlet through which to share their literary skills, and allowed girls an opportunity to document their own personalized historical record<ref name=\"Ohio Historical Society - Tips to Preserve Your Scrapbooks\">{{cite web|url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/tips-to-preserve-your-scrapbooks/|title=Ohio Historical Society - Tips on Preserving Your Scrapbook}}</ref><ref>Greer, J., \"Girls and Literacy in America: Historical Perspectives to the Present Moment\", 2003, ABC-CLIO</ref> previously not readily available to them. [[File:Scharps album page 2.JPG|thumb|A page from a [[Smith College]] student's scrapbook circa 1906. This page uses drawings, ephemera, and physical objects to represent a day in the life of the student.]]For example, college women around the turn of the century used scrapbooks extensively to construct representations of their everyday life as students. Without [[photograph album]]s to provide images of these life events, students created unique representations through scrapbooks in order to illustrate their lives using ephemera and memorabilia. A guest list or group of visiting cards might represent a young woman's visit to a party. A playbill and ticket stub might serve as reminders of a trip to New York to see a Broadway show. Solid objects such as plants, silverware, or small trinkets were also used when further visual representation was needed. \nA page from these subject-based scrapbooks might include class schedules, exam booklets, letters from professors, or other printed material from school events. Thus scrapbooks from this era can create a more complete image of their maker's life.<ref name=\"Garvey, H. 2006\">Garvey, H., \"Writing with Scissors: American Scrapbooks from the Civil War to the Harlem Renaissance\", 2013, Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, scrapbooking was seen as a more involved way to preserve one's experiences than journaling or other writing-based forms of logging. Printed material such as cheap newspapers, visiting cards, playbills, and pamphlets circulated widely during the 19th century and often became the primary components of peoples\u2019 scrapbooks.<ref name=\"Garvey, H. 2006\"/> The growing volume of [[ephemera]] of this kind, parallel to the growth of industrialized society, created a demand for methods of cataloguing and preserving them. This is why scrapbooks devoted solely to cataloguing recipes, coupons, or other lists were also common during this time. Until later in the 19th century, scrapbooks were seen as functional as well as aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"Vosmeier, S. 2006\">Vosmeier, S., \"The Scrapbook in American Life\", 2006, Temple University Press</ref> Several factors, including marketing strategies and technological advancement, contributed to the image of scrapbooking moving further toward the aesthetic plane over the years.\n\nThe advent of modern [[photography]] began with the first permanent photograph created by Joseph [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] in 1826.<ref>{{cite book|  year=2006| author=Marien, Mary Warner| title=Photography: A Cultural History| publisher=Laurence King Publishing|  isbn=0-8109-0559-0}}</ref> This allowed the average person to begin to incorporate photographs into their scrapbooks. However, books or albums made specifically for showcasing photographs alone were not popularized in the United States until closer to 1860. Before that point, photographs were not thought of as items to be reproduced and shared. Demand for photo albums was spurred on in large part by the growing popularity of the [[carte de visite]], a small photograph distributed in the same manner one might a [[visiting card]].<ref name=\"Vosmeier, S. 2006\"/> [[File:Scharpsalbumpage.jpg|thumb|A page from a photograph album circa 1906.

She began designing creative pages for her family's photo memories, inserting the completed pages into [[sheet protector]]s collected in [[Ring binder|3-ring binder]]s. By 1980, she had assembled over fifty volumes and was invited to display them at the World Conference on Records in [[Salt Lake City]]. In 1981 Marielen and her husband Anthony Jay (\"A.J.\") authored and published a how-to booklet, ''Keeping Memories Alive,'' and opened a scrapbook store in Spanish Fork that ended up with the same name, that remains open today.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elaine |last=Jarvik |title=Memories & mementos |work=Deseret News |page=C1 |date=1997-04-23 |quote=[P]eople trace scrapbooking's early beginnings to Marielen Christensen, a Spanish Fork homemaker who began in the mid-1970s to research ways to better preserve family records and memories. ...

What seems to be clear is that traditional scrapbooking is once again in a transition period due to many forces including current economic issues, the influence of social media and the ease of digital sharing, and the rejection of the stereotype of traditional scrapbooks being something that is for older women. However, if one takes a closer look, it is easy to see all the ways people continue memory keeping even if it doesn't fall strictly within the definition of traditional scrapbooking as defined here.\n\nSome examples include the advent of Smash books created by EK Success, which in some ways, are a closer representation to original scrapbooks in that they are wire bound books in a variety of sizes consisting of blank printed background papers into which one can journal and glue mementos into.<ref>[http://www.eksuccessbrands.com/kandcompany/smash/ Eksuccessbrands.com]</ref>\n\nAnother variation is the introduction and growth of pocket scrapbooking, most well known and represented by Project Life created and introduced by Becky Higgins. Higgins created the system in response to her personal desire to continue record the lives of her children and family, but in a quicker, more simple way that allowed her the flexibility to complete the project, but still in an attractive, cohesive way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckyhiggins.com/about-project-life/|title=Project Life|website=Beckyhiggins.com}}</ref>\n\nOne of the newest trends into scrapbooking is bringing the layout designs down to a much smaller size.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Small enough to carry in a small bag with on the go updates and area for creativity and memory keeping. A traditional traveler's notebook is a simple leather cover with a band to keep closed. The cover can hold up to six inserts which can be used in many ways. The notebook has grown in popularity, allowing for journaling and memory keeping for any interests.\n\nMini albums are another great way of memory keeping and a new trend in scrapbooking. They can be made in different sizes based on the number of photos to be put inside the album. These mini albums can be constructed and hand made from scratch.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Materials===\n[[File:PeachBlueNautical sample.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a digital scrapbook kit]]\nThe most important scrapbooking supply is the album itself, which can be permanently bound, or allow for the insertion of pages. There are other formats such as mini albums and accordion-style fold-out albums. Some of these are adhered to various containers, such as matchbooks, CD cases, or other small holders. When scrap artists started moving away from the \"page\" and onto alternative surfaces and objectives, they termed these creations \"altered items\" or now simply called \"off-the-page\". This movement circles back to the history of art from the 1960s when [[Louise Nevelson]] was doing \"Assemblages\" with found objects and recycled parts.\n\nModern scrapbooking is done largely on 12&nbsp;inch (30&nbsp;cm) square or letter-size ([[Paper size|US Letter]] (8.5 by 11&nbsp;inch) or [[ISO 216|A4]] (210 by 297&nbsp;mm)) pages. More recently, smaller albums have become popular. The most common new formats are 6, 7, or 8-inch (15, 17.5, or 20&nbsp;cm) square. It is important to many scrappers to protect their pages with clear page protectors.\n[[File:Herramientas_para_Scrapbooking.jpg|thumb|Different scrapbooking materials and tools]]\nBasic materials include background papers (including printed and [[cardstock paper]]), photo corner mounts (or other means of mounting photos such as adhesive dots, photo mounting tape, or acid-free glue), [[scissors]], a paper trimmer or cutting tool, art pens, archival pens for journaling, and mounting glues (like thermo-tac). More elaborate designs require more specialized tools such as die cut templates, [[rubber stamps]], craft punches, stencils, inking tools, eyelet setters, heat embossing tools and personal die cut machines. A lot of time people who enjoy scrapbooking will create their own background papers by using the tools mentioned along with \"fancy\" textured scissors.\n\nVarious accessories, referred to as \"[[embellishment]]s\", are used to decorate scrapbook pages. Embellishments include [[stickers]], rub-ons, [[Postage stamp|stamps]], [[grommet|eyelets]], [[Brass fastener|brads]], chipboard elements in various shapes, alphabet letters, [[lace]], wire, fabric, beads, sequins, and [[ribbon]]. The use of die cut machines is also increasingly popular; in recent years a number of electronic die-cutting machines resembling a plotter with a drag knife have hit the market (e.g. The [[Cricut]]), enabling scrappers to use their computer to create die cuts out of any shape or font with the use of free or third party software. Scrapbook makers will also use magazine clippings to \"decorate\" a scrapbook.\n\nOne of the key components of modern scrapbooking is the archival quality of the supplies. Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in their original state, materials encouraged by most serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those of many typical photo albums commercially available. Scrappers insist on [[acid-free paper|acid-free]], [[lignin]]-free papers, stamp ink, and [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]] powder. They also use pigment-based inks, which are fade resistant, colorfast, and often [[waterproof]]. Many scrappers use buffered paper, which will protect photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook. Older \"magnetic\" albums are not acid-free and thus cause damage to the photos and memorabilia included in them. Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil on hands.<ref name=\"sensational\">{{cite book | title = Sensational Page Ideas for Scrapbooks | publisher = Memory Makers | year = 2004 | location = Cincinnati, OH | isbn = 1-892127-49-0 | quote = Your hands should be clean and oil free when handling photographs and documents. Oil and dirt can rub off your fingers and onto the documents and photos causing damage and deterioration. Using a pair of inexpensive photography cotton gloves will help keep oily fingerprints from causing long-term damage. | page = 31 | author = }}</ref>\n\nAn international standard, ISO 18902, provides specific guidelines on materials that are safe for scrapbooking through its requirements for albums, framing, and storage materials. ISO 18902 includes requirements for photo-safety and a specific pH range for acid-free materials. ISO 18902 prohibits the use of harmful materials, including [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) and [[Cellulose nitrate]].\n\n===Digital scrapbooking===\nThe advent of [[Image scanner|scanners]], [[desktop publishing]], page layout programs, and advanced [[printing]] options make it relatively easy to create professional-looking layouts in [[Digital data|digital]] form. The [[internet]] allows scrapbookers to [[World Wide Web#Publishing web pages|self-publish]] their work. Scrapbooks that exist completely in digital image form are referred to as \"digital scrapbooks\" or \"computer scrapbooks\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathryn |last=Balint |title=Keepsakes by computer |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040712/news_mz1b12keep.html |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=2004-07-12 |accessdate=2007-11-04 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:DigitalScrapbookPage.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A digital scrapbook layout that demonstrates the use of numerous digital \"materials\"]]\nWhile some people prefer the physicality of the actual artifacts they paste onto the pages of books, the digital scrapbooking hobby has grown in popularity in recent years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Damon |last=Darlin |title=TREND; Goodbye, Glue.

While a physical page can only be torn once and never restored, a digital paper can be torn and untorn with ease, allowing the scrapbooker to try out different looks without wasting supplies. Some web-based digital scrapbooks include a variety of wallpapers and backgrounds to help the users create a rich visual experience. Each paper, photo, or embellishment exists on its own layer in your document, and you can reposition them at your discretion.<ref>{{cite news |first=Randy |last=Pertiet |title=Digital Scrapbooking, Your First Digital Layout using Photoshop or Elements |url=http://www.designerdigitals.com/digital-scrapbooking.html |work=DesignerDigitals.com |date=2008-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, digital scrapbooking is not limited to digital storage and display. Many digital scrappers print their finished layouts to be stored in scrapbook albums. Others have books professionally printed in hard bound books to be saved as keepsakes. Professional printing- and binding-services offer free software to create scrapbooks with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated design and order workflow, real hardcover bound books can be produced more cost effectively.\n\nEarly digital scrapbooks were created from digital photos uploaded to an external site. Over time, this moved to a model of downloading software onto a personal computer that will organize photos and help create the digital scrapbook. With the growth of Web 2.0 functionality, digital scrapbooking is going back online, to avoid the hassles of having to download and install PC software. The availability of cheap online storage (e.g., on Amazon's S3 service), and the desire to leverage pre-uploaded online albums (e.g., on Yahoo's [[Flickr]]) make it more convenient for users to directly compose their digital scrapbooks online. [[Print on demand]] fulfillment enables such digital scrapbooks to effectively supplant traditional scrapbooks.\n\nDigital scrapbooking has advanced to the point where digital scrapbook layouts may be made entirely online using Web-based software. Users upload their photos, create a digital scrapbook layout using a Web page and digital scrapbook graphics. The layout can then be downloaded as a low-resolution [[JPEG]] file for sharing on the Web or as a high-resolution JPEG file for printing.\n\n==Crops==\n\nScrapbooking crops (or \"Crops\") are events where 2 or more scrapbookers gather to work in a social circle on their books, cards or other projects.  It is similar to the old quilting bees that used to be socially prevalent, but has been replaced by today's \"Crop\". Attendees bring specific supplies themselves to work on said projects and sometimes there are vendors at these events to purchase any extra scrapbooking needs. At these events ideas are shared, techniques are taught to one another, products used (e.g. cutting machines such as, Silhouette & Cricut) are learned about and attendees have a few hours to days of uninterrupted time to work on their scrapbooks, cards, or any project they are needing to accomplish.  Events are planned informally at one's home, a church hall or establishments with meeting rooms to the larger attended crops that encompass days of time in a hotel, where the attendee stays in the same hotel and works in the large ballroom or conference rooms in the hotel with tens to hundreds of attendees.  Some of the ways to learn about events are mainly through word of mouth, social media and community postings.\n\n==Industry statistics==\nSome people attribute the increased interest in scrapbooking to a renewed passion for [[genealogy]], while others say that it is an outlet for those interested in [[photography]] and [[graphic design]].\n\nFor evidence of interest in scrapbooking, consider the following facts:\n{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n* Over 4 million women in the United States alone consider themselves to be scrapbookers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n* Over 4% of all women in U.S. have done traditional scrapbooking. Millions of others do various aspects of photo books but are not scrapbookers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n* Scrapbooking is one of the largest categories within the craft and hobby industry and now considered{{By whom|date=January 2013}} to be the third most popular craft in the nation. From 1996 through 2004, sales of scrapbooking products increased across the United States. In 2005, annual sales flattened for the first time after many back to back years of double growth. From 2006 through 2010 traditional scrapbooking sales have declined, while digital forms of scrapbooking have grown. Traditional scrapbooking sales for 2010 have declined to about $1.6 billion in annual sales from a peak of about $2.5 billion in 2005.<ref>[http://scrapbooking.com/sales/files/MagazineProfile.pdf Scrapbooking.com Tell Us Your Story, 2011 Magazine Profile]. Retrieved 18 May 2014.</ref>\n\nDuring that same time frame the number of independent scrapbooking stores declined from a high of 4,200 to about 1,200 independent storefronts. The number of scrapbooking manufacturers also declined in that same period from a high of 800 to under 250{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.\n\n==Common idioms==\n\n===Journaling===\nIn addition to the collection of photographs, tickets, postcards, and other memorabilia, journaling is often a principal element in modern scrapbooks. Journaling is text that describes, explains, or accents the photographs on a scrapbook page. Contemporary journaling can take many forms. It can be reflective and story-like, take a reportive tone, or simply be a list of words. Journaling may also include song lyrics, quotations, and poems. The value of journaling lies in the fact that it provides an account of family histories that may otherwise not be preserved.\n\nMany consider journaling one of the most important elements of any scrapbook.<ref>{{cite news |title=Making Memories Last |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/16/earlyshow/living/parenting/main522161.shtml |work=The Early Show |publisher=CBS News |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2007-11-04 |quote=For Randall, the journaling aspect of scrapbooking is so important because as the years pass, people don't always remember everything. }}</ref> Journaling is a personal choice and it can describe the event, the photographs, or relate feelings and emotions. Handwritten journaling is considered best by some scrapbookers who see handwriting as valuable for posterity, but many people journal on the computer and print it onto a variety of surfaces including vellum, tape, ribbon, and paper.\n\n===Sketches===\nScrapbookers will sometimes refer to sketches for inspiration for their pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Sketches are a hand-drawn layout showing where to position photos, titles, journaling and embellishments. It gives novice scrapbookers somewhere to begin if they are not experienced with balancing the layout correctly. Scrapbookers can interpret the sketch in any way they choose; it is a great starting point when you have scrappers-block. There have been many sketchbooks published and scrapbooking magazines always offer sketches as part of their content.{{Original research inline|date=May 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Baby books|Baby book]], a record of a baby's birth and growth\n*[[Commonplace book]], formerly a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books\n*[[Cricut]], a home-scrapbooking machine.\n*[[Media preservation]]\n*[[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n*[[Silva rerum]], a specific type of a book, a multi-generational chronicle, kept by many Polish noble families from the 16th through 18th centuries\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Scrapbooking}}\n<!-- =========================={{NoMoreLinks}} (modified)=========================  -->\n\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Each commonplace book was unique to its creator's particular interests. Friendship albums became popular in the 16th century. These albums were used much like modern day [[yearbooks]], where friends or patrons would enter their names, titles and short texts or illustrations at the request of the album's owner. These albums were often created as souvenirs of European tours and would contain local memorabilia including coats of arms or works of art commissioned by local artisans.<ref name=\"Katritzky, M.

[[File:Scharps album page 2.JPG|thumb|A page from a [[Smith College]] student's scrapbook circa 1906. This page uses drawings, ephemera, and physical objects to represent a day in the life of the student.]]For example, college women around the turn of the century used scrapbooks extensively to construct representations of their everyday life as students. Without [[photograph album]]s to provide images of these life events, students created unique representations through scrapbooks in order to illustrate their lives using ephemera and memorabilia. A guest list or group of visiting cards might represent a young woman's visit to a party. A playbill and ticket stub might serve as reminders of a trip to New York to see a Broadway show. Solid objects such as plants, silverware, or small trinkets were also used when further visual representation was needed. \nA page from these subject-based scrapbooks might include class schedules, exam booklets, letters from professors, or other printed material from school events. Thus scrapbooks from this era can create a more complete image of their maker's life.<ref name=\"Garvey, H. 2006\">Garvey, H., \"Writing with Scissors: American Scrapbooks from the Civil War to the Harlem Renaissance\", 2013, Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, scrapbooking was seen as a more involved way to preserve one's experiences than journaling or other writing-based forms of logging. Printed material such as cheap newspapers, visiting cards, playbills, and pamphlets circulated widely during the 19th century and often became the primary components of peoples\u2019 scrapbooks.<ref name=\"Garvey, H. 2006\"/> The growing volume of [[ephemera]] of this kind, parallel to the growth of industrialized society, created a demand for methods of cataloguing and preserving them. This is why scrapbooks devoted solely to cataloguing recipes, coupons, or other lists were also common during this time. Until later in the 19th century, scrapbooks were seen as functional as well as aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"Vosmeier, S. 2006\">Vosmeier, S., \"The Scrapbook in American Life\", 2006, Temple University Press</ref> Several factors, including marketing strategies and technological advancement, contributed to the image of scrapbooking moving further toward the aesthetic plane over the years.\n\nThe advent of modern [[photography]] began with the first permanent photograph created by Joseph [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] in 1826.<ref>{{cite book|  year=2006| author=Marien, Mary Warner| title=Photography: A Cultural History| publisher=Laurence King Publishing|  isbn=0-8109-0559-0}}</ref> This allowed the average person to begin to incorporate photographs into their scrapbooks. However, books or albums made specifically for showcasing photographs alone were not popularized in the United States until closer to 1860. Before that point, photographs were not thought of as items to be reproduced and shared. Demand for photo albums was spurred on in large part by the growing popularity of the [[carte de visite]], a small photograph distributed in the same manner one might a [[visiting card]].<ref name=\"Vosmeier, S. 2006\"/> [[File:Scharpsalbumpage.jpg|thumb|A page from a photograph album circa 1906.

She began designing creative pages for her family's photo memories, inserting the completed pages into [[sheet protector]]s collected in [[Ring binder|3-ring binder]]s. By 1980, she had assembled over fifty volumes and was invited to display them at the World Conference on Records in [[Salt Lake City]]. In 1981 Marielen and her husband Anthony Jay (\"A.J.\") authored and published a how-to booklet, ''Keeping Memories Alive,'' and opened a scrapbook store in Spanish Fork that ended up with the same name, that remains open today.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elaine |last=Jarvik |title=Memories & mementos |work=Deseret News |page=C1 |date=1997-04-23 |quote=[P]eople trace scrapbooking's early beginnings to Marielen Christensen, a Spanish Fork homemaker who began in the mid-1970s to research ways to better preserve family records and memories. ...

What seems to be clear is that traditional scrapbooking is once again in a transition period due to many forces including current economic issues, the influence of social media and the ease of digital sharing, and the rejection of the stereotype of traditional scrapbooks being something that is for older women. However, if one takes a closer look, it is easy to see all the ways people continue memory keeping even if it doesn't fall strictly within the definition of traditional scrapbooking as defined here.\n\nSome examples include the advent of Smash books created by EK Success, which in some ways, are a closer representation to original scrapbooks in that they are wire bound books in a variety of sizes consisting of blank printed background papers into which one can journal and glue mementos into.<ref>[http://www.eksuccessbrands.com/kandcompany/smash/ Eksuccessbrands.com]</ref>\n\nAnother variation is the introduction and growth of pocket scrapbooking, most well known and represented by Project Life created and introduced by Becky Higgins. Higgins created the system in response to her personal desire to continue record the lives of her children and family, but in a quicker, more simple way that allowed her the flexibility to complete the project, but still in an attractive, cohesive way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckyhiggins.com/about-project-life/|title=Project Life|website=Beckyhiggins.com}}</ref>\n\nOne of the newest trends into scrapbooking is bringing the layout designs down to a much smaller size.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Small enough to carry in a small bag with on the go updates and area for creativity and memory keeping. A traditional traveler's notebook is a simple leather cover with a band to keep closed. The cover can hold up to six inserts which can be used in many ways. The notebook has grown in popularity, allowing for journaling and memory keeping for any interests.\n\nMini albums are another great way of memory keeping and a new trend in scrapbooking. They can be made in different sizes based on the number of photos to be put inside the album. These mini albums can be constructed and hand made from scratch.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Materials===\n[[File:PeachBlueNautical sample.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a digital scrapbook kit]]\nThe most important scrapbooking supply is the album itself, which can be permanently bound, or allow for the insertion of pages. There are other formats such as mini albums and accordion-style fold-out albums. Some of these are adhered to various containers, such as matchbooks, CD cases, or other small holders. When scrap artists started moving away from the \"page\" and onto alternative surfaces and objectives, they termed these creations \"altered items\" or now simply called \"off-the-page\". This movement circles back to the history of art from the 1960s when [[Louise Nevelson]] was doing \"Assemblages\" with found objects and recycled parts.\n\nModern scrapbooking is done largely on 12&nbsp;inch (30&nbsp;cm) square or letter-size ([[Paper size|US Letter]] (8.5 by 11&nbsp;inch) or [[ISO 216|A4]] (210 by 297&nbsp;mm)) pages. More recently, smaller albums have become popular. The most common new formats are 6, 7, or 8-inch (15, 17.5, or 20&nbsp;cm) square. It is important to many scrappers to protect their pages with clear page protectors.\n[[File:Herramientas_para_Scrapbooking.jpg|thumb|Different scrapbooking materials and tools]]\nBasic materials include background papers (including printed and [[cardstock paper]]), photo corner mounts (or other means of mounting photos such as adhesive dots, photo mounting tape, or acid-free glue), [[scissors]], a paper trimmer or cutting tool, art pens, archival pens for journaling, and mounting glues (like thermo-tac). More elaborate designs require more specialized tools such as die cut templates, [[rubber stamps]], craft punches, stencils, inking tools, eyelet setters, heat embossing tools and personal die cut machines. A lot of time people who enjoy scrapbooking will create their own background papers by using the tools mentioned along with \"fancy\" textured scissors.\n\nVarious accessories, referred to as \"[[embellishment]]s\", are used to decorate scrapbook pages. Embellishments include [[stickers]], rub-ons, [[Postage stamp|stamps]], [[grommet|eyelets]], [[Brass fastener|brads]], chipboard elements in various shapes, alphabet letters, [[lace]], wire, fabric, beads, sequins, and [[ribbon]]. The use of die cut machines is also increasingly popular; in recent years a number of electronic die-cutting machines resembling a plotter with a drag knife have hit the market (e.g. The [[Cricut]]), enabling scrappers to use their computer to create die cuts out of any shape or font with the use of free or third party software. Scrapbook makers will also use magazine clippings to \"decorate\" a scrapbook.\n\nOne of the key components of modern scrapbooking is the archival quality of the supplies. Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in their original state, materials encouraged by most serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those of many typical photo albums commercially available. Scrappers insist on [[acid-free paper|acid-free]], [[lignin]]-free papers, stamp ink, and [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]] powder. They also use pigment-based inks, which are fade resistant, colorfast, and often [[waterproof]]. Many scrappers use buffered paper, which will protect photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook. Older \"magnetic\" albums are not acid-free and thus cause damage to the photos and memorabilia included in them. Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil on hands.<ref name=\"sensational\">{{cite book | title = Sensational Page Ideas for Scrapbooks | publisher = Memory Makers | year = 2004 | location = Cincinnati, OH | isbn = 1-892127-49-0 | quote = Your hands should be clean and oil free when handling photographs and documents. Oil and dirt can rub off your fingers and onto the documents and photos causing damage and deterioration. Using a pair of inexpensive photography cotton gloves will help keep oily fingerprints from causing long-term damage. | page = 31 | author = }}</ref>\n\nAn international standard, ISO 18902, provides specific guidelines on materials that are safe for scrapbooking through its requirements for albums, framing, and storage materials. ISO 18902 includes requirements for photo-safety and a specific pH range for acid-free materials. ISO 18902 prohibits the use of harmful materials, including [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) and [[Cellulose nitrate]].\n\n===Digital scrapbooking===\nThe advent of [[Image scanner|scanners]], [[desktop publishing]], page layout programs, and advanced [[printing]] options make it relatively easy to create professional-looking layouts in [[Digital data|digital]] form. The [[internet]] allows scrapbookers to [[World Wide Web#Publishing web pages|self-publish]] their work. Scrapbooks that exist completely in digital image form are referred to as \"digital scrapbooks\" or \"computer scrapbooks\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathryn |last=Balint |title=Keepsakes by computer |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040712/news_mz1b12keep.html |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=2004-07-12 |accessdate=2007-11-04 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:DigitalScrapbookPage.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A digital scrapbook layout that demonstrates the use of numerous digital \"materials\"]]\nWhile some people prefer the physicality of the actual artifacts they paste onto the pages of books, the digital scrapbooking hobby has grown in popularity in recent years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Damon |last=Darlin |title=TREND; Goodbye, Glue.

While a physical page can only be torn once and never restored, a digital paper can be torn and untorn with ease, allowing the scrapbooker to try out different looks without wasting supplies. Some web-based digital scrapbooks include a variety of wallpapers and backgrounds to help the users create a rich visual experience. Each paper, photo, or embellishment exists on its own layer in your document, and you can reposition them at your discretion.<ref>{{cite news |first=Randy |last=Pertiet |title=Digital Scrapbooking, Your First Digital Layout using Photoshop or Elements |url=http://www.designerdigitals.com/digital-scrapbooking.html |work=DesignerDigitals.com |date=2008-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, digital scrapbooking is not limited to digital storage and display. Many digital scrappers print their finished layouts to be stored in scrapbook albums. Others have books professionally printed in hard bound books to be saved as keepsakes. Professional printing- and binding-services offer free software to create scrapbooks with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated design and order workflow, real hardcover bound books can be produced more cost effectively.\n\nEarly digital scrapbooks were created from digital photos uploaded to an external site. Over time, this moved to a model of downloading software onto a personal computer that will organize photos and help create the digital scrapbook. With the growth of Web 2.0 functionality, digital scrapbooking is going back online, to avoid the hassles of having to download and install PC software. The availability of cheap online storage (e.g., on Amazon's S3 service), and the desire to leverage pre-uploaded online albums (e.g., on Yahoo's [[Flickr]]) make it more convenient for users to directly compose their digital scrapbooks online. [[Print on demand]] fulfillment enables such digital scrapbooks to effectively supplant traditional scrapbooks.\n\nDigital scrapbooking has advanced to the point where digital scrapbook layouts may be made entirely online using Web-based software. Users upload their photos, create a digital scrapbook layout using a Web page and digital scrapbook graphics. The layout can then be downloaded as a low-resolution [[JPEG]] file for sharing on the Web or as a high-resolution JPEG file for printing.\n\n==Crops==\n\nScrapbooking crops (or \"Crops\") are events where 2 or more scrapbookers gather to work in a social circle on their books, cards or other projects.  It is similar to the old quilting bees that used to be socially prevalent, but has been replaced by today's \"Crop\". Attendees bring specific supplies themselves to work on said projects and sometimes there are vendors at these events to purchase any extra scrapbooking needs. At these events ideas are shared, techniques are taught to one another, products used (e.g. cutting machines such as, Silhouette & Cricut) are learned about and attendees have a few hours to days of uninterrupted time to work on their scrapbooks, cards, or any project they are needing to accomplish.  Events are planned informally at one's home, a church hall or establishments with meeting rooms to the larger attended crops that encompass days of time in a hotel, where the attendee stays in the same hotel and works in the large ballroom or conference rooms in the hotel with tens to hundreds of attendees.  Some of the ways to learn about events are mainly through word of mouth, social media and community postings.\n\n==Industry statistics==\nSome people attribute the increased interest in scrapbooking to a renewed passion for [[genealogy]], while others say that it is an outlet for those interested in [[photography]] and [[graphic design]].\n\nFor evidence of interest in scrapbooking, consider the following facts:\n{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n* Over 4 million women in the United States alone consider themselves to be scrapbookers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n* Over 4% of all women in U.S. have done traditional scrapbooking. Millions of others do various aspects of photo books but are not scrapbookers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n* Scrapbooking is one of the largest categories within the craft and hobby industry and now considered{{By whom|date=January 2013}} to be the third most popular craft in the nation. From 1996 through 2004, sales of scrapbooking products increased across the United States. In 2005, annual sales flattened for the first time after many back to back years of double growth. From 2006 through 2010 traditional scrapbooking sales have declined, while digital forms of scrapbooking have grown. Traditional scrapbooking sales for 2010 have declined to about $1.6 billion in annual sales from a peak of about $2.5 billion in 2005.<ref>[http://scrapbooking.com/sales/files/MagazineProfile.pdf Scrapbooking.com Tell Us Your Story, 2011 Magazine Profile].

The number of scrapbooking manufacturers also declined in that same period from a high of 800 to under 250{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.\n\n==Common idioms==\n\n===Journaling===\nIn addition to the collection of photographs, tickets, postcards, and other memorabilia, journaling is often a principal element in modern scrapbooks. Journaling is text that describes, explains, or accents the photographs on a scrapbook page. Contemporary journaling can take many forms. It can be reflective and story-like, take a reportive tone, or simply be a list of words. Journaling may also include song lyrics, quotations, and poems. The value of journaling lies in the fact that it provides an account of family histories that may otherwise not be preserved.\n\nMany consider journaling one of the most important elements of any scrapbook.<ref>{{cite news |title=Making Memories Last |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/16/earlyshow/living/parenting/main522161.shtml |work=The Early Show |publisher=CBS News |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2007-11-04 |quote=For Randall, the journaling aspect of scrapbooking is so important because as the years pass, people don't always remember everything. }}</ref> Journaling is a personal choice and it can describe the event, the photographs, or relate feelings and emotions. Handwritten journaling is considered best by some scrapbookers who see handwriting as valuable for posterity, but many people journal on the computer and print it onto a variety of surfaces including vellum, tape, ribbon, and paper.\n\n===Sketches===\nScrapbookers will sometimes refer to sketches for inspiration for their pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Sketches are a hand-drawn layout showing where to position photos, titles, journaling and embellishments. It gives novice scrapbookers somewhere to begin if they are not experienced with balancing the layout correctly.
