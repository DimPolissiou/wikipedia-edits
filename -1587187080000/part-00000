They were the only British battleships built between the {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|4}} (ordered in 1913) and the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}}, ordered in 1936.\n\nThe ships were named after famous British [[admiral]]s: [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney]], victor of the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] and the [[Battle of the Saintes]], and [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], who won the Battles of the [[Battle of the Nile|Nile]] and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].\n\nTo comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an unusual design with many novel features. They are often referred to as the first [[treaty battleship]]s. The ''Nelson''s were unique in British battleship construction, being the only ships to carry a main armament of nine {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns. The most unusual feature however, and one that is immediately noticeable, is that these were all carried forward of the bridge.\n\nCommissioned in 1927\u201329, the ''Nelson''s served extensively in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian oceans during [[World War II]]. {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} was made famous by her role in the sinking of the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2|up=y}} in May 1941. At the climax of the battle ''Rodney'', in conjunction with ''King George V'', closed on ''Bismarck'' to bombard her at short range. ''Rodney''{{'}}s main guns were credited with an estimated 100 to 130 hits, contributing greatly to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s final destruction.\n\n''Nelson'' and ''Rodney'' participated in the bombardment of targets in northern France during and after [[D-Day]]. In particular, during the [[Battle for Caen|Caen campaign]] ''Nelson'' was credited with destroying a group of five [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]] which ventured into a red zone [within {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} of the coast] deemed by the German command to be in range of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] battleships.\n\nBoth ships of the class survived the war, but were scrapped in 1948\u20131949 along with all other British battleships except the four remaining ''King George V''-class battleships and {{HMS|Vanguard|23|2}}.\n\n==Background and design==\nThe [[Battle of Jutland]] had shown the value of [[fire power|firepower]] and [[armour|protection]] over speed and manoeuvrability.<ref>''British Battleships 1939\u201345 (II)'', Angus Konstam, Osprey Publishing.</ref>\n\nThe next generation of British warships incorporated this lesson. After the [[First World War]], the [[Admiralty]] drew up plans for massive, heavily armoured [[battlecruiser]]s and battleships, far larger and stronger than all previous vessels. The {{sclass2-|G3|battlecruiser|2}}s would carry {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, and the proposed {{sclass2-|N3|battleship|2}}s would carry nine {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, and would be the most powerful vessels afloat. The Royal Navy was planning to hold its superiority in the burgeoning arms race, despite the large warships planned in Japan and the United States.<ref name=\"PrestonB\">{{cite book |last=Preston |first=Antony |date= |title=Battleships |authorlink=Antony Preston |location=London |publisher=Bison Books |isbn=0861242599 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment was abruptly curtailed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, which brought the arms race to a halt. The four battlecruisers that had been ordered were cancelled. Some of the material acquired would later be used in ''Nelson'' and ''Rodney''. The Treaty limited all nations' battleships to 35,000&nbsp;tons and 16-inch guns. The British had successfully ensured that the definition of maximum displacement \u2013 the [[standard displacement]] \u2013 excluded both fuel and boiler feed water. They had argued that having to protect the widespread [[British Empire]] meant their ships had to carry more of both and they should not be penalised compared to nations, such as Japan, France and Italy, that operated normally much closer to their home bases. As a result, water-filled [[Anti-torpedo bulge|internal anti-torpedo bulges]] could be incorporated, which did not contribute to the \"dry\" (standard) weights and therefore did not exceed the treaty displacement limits.<ref name=\"PrestonB\"/>\n\nThe limits of the treaty inevitably led to compromises in the design of two new ships, and the resulting ''Nelson'' class sacrificed installed power (and hence speed) in order that they be well-armed and defended. They were often referred to as the [[George Washington#Personal life|\"Cherry Tree\"]] class, because they had been \"cut down by Washington\".<ref name=\"PrestonB\"/> The need to limit displacement resulted in a radical new warship design, drawn from the \"G3\" and \"N3\" designs of [[Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt]], [[Director of Naval Construction]] from 1912 to 1924. To reduce the weight of armour, the main gun turrets were all mounted forward to shorten the armoured citadel. The \"G3\" and \"N3\" had two turrets forward of the bridge with the third between the bridge and the funnels/aft superstructure. However, in the ''Nelson''s, this was taken further and all three were in front of the bridge; \"B\" mount superfiring over \"A\", with \"X\" turret on the fo'c'sle deck behind \"B\", and therefore unable to fire directly forward or aft. \"X\" turret is sometimes referred to as \"C\" turret and one alternative design, designated \"O3\", had it superfiring over both \"A\" and \"B\" turrets.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The secondary guns were placed in totally enclosed director-controlled twin turrets at the upper deck level and were grouped aft \u2013 another innovative element taken from the G3 and N3 design.<ref name=\"PrestonB\"/><ref name=\"referenceD\">Brown 1999, p. </ref>\n\nThe machinery was of necessity limited in weight, size and installed power, and there were only two shafts with quite large screws. All previous British battleships since {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} of 1906 had four screws as did all British battleship classes after ''Nelson''. In order that flue gasses be kept clear of the superstructure, the boiler rooms were moved behind the engine rooms, exhausting into a single funnel. This orientation also reduced the overall length of the armoured citadel. As a countermeasure to the limited power, the hull was of a very efficient hydrodynamic form, to attain the best possible speed.<ref name=\"referenceD\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe ''Nelson''s had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|660|ft|m|1}} and an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|709|ft|10|in|m|1}} (''Nelson'') or {{convert|710|ft|3|in|m|1}} (''Rodney''), a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|106|ft|m|1}}, and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|30|ft|4|in|m|1}} at mean [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]]. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|33300|-|33730|LT|t}} at standard load and {{convert|37430|-|37780|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. Their crew numbered 1,361 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]] when serving as flagships and 1,314 as [[private ship]]s. At deep load, they had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|10.2|ft|m|1}},<ref>Burt, pp. 348\u2013349</ref> which gave them a quick [[Ship motions|roll]] between 11.2 and 13.6 seconds.<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 126\u2013127</ref> In calm weather, the ''Nelson''-class ships were very manoeuvreable, but the large surface area of the superstructure gave them a large amount of [[weather helm]] and they could be a handful in confined spaces with a strong wind as was demonstrated when {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} ran aground off [[Southsea]] beach in 1934.<ref>Burt, pp. 350, 357\u2013359</ref> \n\nThe ships were powered by two sets of [[John Brown & Company|Brown-Curtis]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one shaft, using steam from eight [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s fitted with [[superheater]]s that operated at a pressure of {{convert|250|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The turbines were rated at {{convert|45000|shp|lk=on}} and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The [[sister ship]]s exceeded their designed speed during their [[sea trial]]s in 1927, reaching speeds of {{convert|23.6|-|23.8|kn}} from {{convert|45614|-|46031|shp|abbr=on}}. They carried {{convert|3770|-|3805|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] to give them a designed range of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 114, 124\u2013125</ref>\n\n===Armour===\nArmour weight was also reduced by using an internal, inclined armour belt sloped outward at 72 degrees vertically, {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick over the main magazines and control positions to {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on}} over the machinery and 6-inch gun magazines. The slope increased the relative thickness of the belt to a plunging projectile. Water-filled compartments, surrounded by air-filled ones, formed internal torpedo bulges which were fitted between the armour and the external hull of the ship, which was not armoured. The outer hull plating was meant to initiate detonation of shells which would then explode outside the armour. This innovation dispensed with external torpedo bulges which would otherwise have reduced the speed of the ships due to drag. The armour scheme was of the \"[[All or nothing (armour)|all or nothing]]\" principle; areas were either well protected, from the front of \"A\" barbette rearwards to the after 6-inch turrets, or were not protected at all, disposing of the multiple intermediate thickness of armour seen in older designs. For the first time a British battleship had a single, {{convert|6.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick armoured deck to protect against plunging shells and aircraft-launched bombs, with {{convert|4.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} armour over the stern, both on top of the 0.5 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) deck plating. The main turrets had {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} Non-cemented (NC) armour on the faces, {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the sides, {{convert|7.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the roof and {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the rear with {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} around the barbettes. The secondary turrets, however, had only {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} NC all round over 0.5 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) structural steel plates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"referenceD\"/>\n\n===Superstructure===\nThe large superstructure which was octagonal in plan, was known to its crew as the \"Octopoidal\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''HMS Rodney'', Iain Ballantyne, Pen & Sword Books, {{ISBN|978 1 84415 406 7}}</ref> and was sometimes referred to as \"[[Queen Anne's Mansions]]\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Burt, p. </ref> due to its similarity to a 14-storey brick residential development opposite [[St. James's Park tube station]] in London. The superstructure provided spacious, weatherproof working spaces for the navigating officers and any flag officers embarked. This innovative bridge design was subsequently copied by the French in the [[Dunkerque-class_battleship|''Dunkerque''-class]] battleships, as was the all-forward main armament orientation, both features which were repeated in the [[Richelieu-class_battleship|''Richelieu''-class]] designs.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">''French Battleships 1922-1956'', John Jordan & Robert Dumas, Seaforth Publishing, {{ISBN|978 1 84832 034 5}}</ref> Except for the emergency conning tower at its base, and the trunking for the main gun directors mounted on top, the superstructure was lightly armoured against splinters only, to save weight. Additional weight-saving design measures included the use of light materials such as aluminium for fittings, and [[fir]] instead of [[teak]] for deck planking, although subsequently, teak decks were fitted in the late 1920s, following concerns that the ships could not fire a full broadside without causing structural damage to the decks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe ''Nelson'' class was a revolutionary but compromised design, and unsurprisingly there were shortcomings. The location of the superstructure towards the stern caused manoeuvrability problems in high winds, especially when steaming at low speeds, where the superstructure acted somewhat like a [[mizzen]] [[sail]] permanently set, causing the ships to \"weathervane\" but according to Captain [[Hugh Binney]], who commanded ''Nelson'' in the late twenties, \"if this is kept in mind, no real difficulties should be encountered in any circumstances\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was potentially a problem in crowded harbours, and made the ships somewhat difficult to dock and embark although this issue never led to a major incident. Binney also stated \"In the early stages of the ship's first commission, there was a general misconception that the ''Nelson'' class were unhandy and difficult to manoeuvre. Both my predecessor and myself, however, very soon discovered that this opinion was entirely fallacious! In calm weather, the ship's manoeuvring capabilities are in no way inferior, and in many ways superior to those of ''Queen Elizabeth'' or ''Revenge''.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They could also be awkward to manoeuvre when moving astern. This was attributed to the ships having a single, central rudder which was out of the propeller race of the twin screws. At sea, however, they were reported to handle well, with a comparatively small Tactical Diameter (turning circle) particularly when turning into the wind, according to Lt. Cmdr. [[Galfry Gatacre]] RAN (later Rear Admiral), who served in 1941\u20131942 as the Navigator for both ''Nelson'' and subsequently ''Rodney''. He reported no difficulty in navigating either ship through the boom gates at [[Scapa Flow]].  ''Nelson'' and ''Rodney'' were the only battleships never to have bumped the boom gate vessel as they passed through Hoxa Sound.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:HMS Nelson during gunnery trials.jpg|thumb|left|''Nelson'' fires a salvo during gunnery trials in 1942]]\nTheir main armament of nine {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns were mounted in triple turrets, the only RN battleships designed in this manner. The guns themselves deviated from standard British designs. Where previous RN weapons fired heavy shells at a moderate velocity, the ''Nelson''{{'}}s weapons followed the German practice of a lighter shell at a higher velocity. This change in Director of Naval Ordnance policy was due to British testing of surrendered German equipment after World War I, although much later, subsequent testing proved contradictory. Two different rifling rates were tried, and for some time there was a mixture of barrel types in different turrets, even sometimes within the same turret. The guns suffered considerable barrel wear and had a fairly large dispersion pattern, due mainly to the different riflings that each barrel had as they were refurbished over their lifespan. To compensate for barrel wear, muzzle velocities were reduced and a heavier (longer) shell was tried to offset this; but the cost of producing new shells, modifying shell handling and storage equipment came at a time when RN funding had been heavily reduced. Nevertheless, these weapons were not generally considered by the RN to be as successful as the previous [[BL 15 inch /42 naval gun|BL 15&nbsp;inch Mark I]]; the [[BL 14-inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 14-inch Mark VII]], fitted to the subsequent ''King George V''-class battleships, returned to a heavier (relatively) shell and lower velocity, but its performance was compromised by an over-complex mounting that proved to have reliability defects in combat. The need to reduce displacement led to the use of triple mount turrets, which had early problems with the ammunition handling and loading machinery. The heavier weight of the triple in comparison to a twin turret meant increased stresses on the roller bearings when training the turrets. This was solved by the incorporation of spring-loaded vertical as well as conventional horizontal roller bearings. The triple mount turret proved itself when, in October 1929, a turret crew with two years' experience loaded and fired 33 consecutive rounds without mishap.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The incorporation of many safety features, achieved with lighter materials, meant that the complex and relatively fragile equipment had to be serviced regularly over the ships' lifetime. These ships were fitted with the [[HACS]] AA fire control system and the [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]] Mk I for surface fire control of the main armament.\n\nFiring trials revealed that the blast of 'A' and 'B' turrets on forward bearings caused damage to many weather-deck fittings and conditions on the mess-decks became very uncomfortable. When 'X' turret was fired 30 degrees abaft the beam and elevation of 40 degrees, considerable damage occurred to the vertically stacked two rows of bridge windows.<ref>Raven & Roberts, p. 118</ref> As a result, the guns of \"X\" turret were usually prohibited from firing abaft of the beam at high elevations during peacetime practice firing. Fitting [[tempered glass]] in the bridge windows was tried, but gun blast still shattered some of them and filled the bridge with flying debris. The design of the Captain's bridge was altered on ''Nelson'' circa 1930-33 to reduce the window area and enclose the upper portion of the previous two rows of glass. A great deal of effort was expended in correcting this problem, and fitting of protective ledges below the new smaller windows proved successful. A new enclosed Admiral's bridge with its requisite reduced windows was built on top of the Captain's bridge and the forward signalling lamps were moved up one level and towards the aft of the bridge. The Admiral's bridge on ''Rodney'' remained stepped back somewhat from the forward edge of the tower, but the Captain's bridge had the same reduced area of glass that ''Nelson'' now had, with larger ledges.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Blast was also a problem elsewhere; D.K. Brown tells of a test firing that was suspended when DNC observer H.S. Pengelly, who was beneath the foredeck, reported a bright red flash after firing all guns in \"A\" turret. This was later discovered to be caused by concussion of the observers' eyeballs.<ref name=\"referenceD\"/>\n\nIn the final phase of the action against ''Bismarck'', ''Rodney'' fired a pair of 24.5-inch torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit.<ref>''Reports of Proceedings 1921-1964'', G.G.O.

They were the only British battleships built between the {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|4}} (ordered in 1913) and the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}}, ordered in 1936.\n\nThe ships were named after famous British [[admiral]]s: [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney]], victor of the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] and the [[Battle of the Saintes]], and [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], who won the Battles of the [[Battle of the Nile|Nile]] and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].\n\nTo comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an unusual design with many novel features. They are often referred to as the first [[treaty battleship]]s. The ''Nelson''s were unique in British battleship construction, being the only ships to carry a main armament of nine {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns. The most unusual feature however, and one that is immediately noticeable, is that these were all carried forward of the bridge.\n\nCommissioned in 1927\u201329, the ''Nelson''s served extensively in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian oceans during [[World War II]]. {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} was made famous by her role in the sinking of the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2|up=y}} in May 1941. At the climax of the battle ''Rodney'', in conjunction with ''King George V'', closed on ''Bismarck'' to bombard her at short range. ''Rodney''{{'}}s main guns were credited with an estimated 100 to 130 hits, contributing greatly to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s final destruction.\n\n''Nelson'' and ''Rodney'' participated in the bombardment of targets in northern France during and after [[D-Day]]. In particular, during the [[Battle for Caen|Caen campaign]] ''Nelson'' was credited with destroying a group of five [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]] which ventured into a red zone [within {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} of the coast] deemed by the German command to be in range of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] battleships.\n\nBoth ships of the class survived the war, but were scrapped in 1948\u20131949 along with all other British battleships except the four remaining ''King George V''-class battleships and {{HMS|Vanguard|23|2}}.\n\n==Background and design==\nThe [[Battle of Jutland]] had shown the value of [[fire power|firepower]] and [[armour|protection]] over speed and manoeuvrability.<ref>''British Battleships 1939\u201345 (II)'', Angus Konstam, Osprey Publishing.</ref>\n\nThe next generation of British warships incorporated this lesson. After the [[First World War]], the [[Admiralty]] drew up plans for massive, heavily armoured [[battlecruiser]]s and battleships, far larger and stronger than all previous vessels. The {{sclass2-|G3|battlecruiser|2}}s would carry {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, and the proposed {{sclass2-|N3|battleship|2}}s would carry nine {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, and would be the most powerful vessels afloat. The Royal Navy was planning to hold its superiority in the burgeoning arms race, despite the large warships planned in Japan and the United States.<ref name=\"PrestonB\">{{cite book |last=Preston |first=Antony |date= |title=Battleships |authorlink=Antony Preston |location=London |publisher=Bison Books |isbn=0861242599 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment was abruptly curtailed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, which brought the arms race to a halt. The four battlecruisers that had been ordered were cancelled. Some of the material acquired would later be used in ''Nelson'' and ''Rodney''. The Treaty limited all nations' battleships to 35,000&nbsp;tons and 16-inch guns. The British had successfully ensured that the definition of maximum displacement \u2013 the [[standard displacement]] \u2013 excluded both fuel and boiler feed water. They had argued that having to protect the widespread [[British Empire]] meant their ships had to carry more of both and they should not be penalised compared to nations, such as Japan, France and Italy, that operated normally much closer to their home bases. As a result, water-filled [[Anti-torpedo bulge|internal anti-torpedo bulges]] could be incorporated, which did not contribute to the \"dry\" (standard) weights and therefore did not exceed the treaty displacement limits.<ref name=\"PrestonB\"/>\n\nThe limits of the treaty inevitably led to compromises in the design of two new ships, and the resulting ''Nelson'' class sacrificed installed power (and hence speed) in order that they be well-armed and defended. They were often referred to as the [[George Washington#Personal life|\"Cherry Tree\"]] class, because they had been \"cut down by Washington\".<ref name=\"PrestonB\"/> The need to limit displacement resulted in a radical new warship design, drawn from the \"G3\" and \"N3\" designs of [[Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt]], [[Director of Naval Construction]] from 1912 to 1924. To reduce the weight of armour, the main gun turrets were all mounted forward to shorten the armoured citadel. The \"G3\" and \"N3\" had two turrets forward of the bridge with the third between the bridge and the funnels/aft superstructure. However, in the ''Nelson''s, this was taken further and all three were in front of the bridge; \"B\" mount superfiring over \"A\", with \"X\" turret on the fo'c'sle deck behind \"B\", and therefore unable to fire directly forward or aft. \"X\" turret is sometimes referred to as \"C\" turret and one alternative design, designated \"O3\", had it superfiring over both \"A\" and \"B\" turrets.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The secondary guns were placed in totally enclosed director-controlled twin turrets at the upper deck level and were grouped aft \u2013 another innovative element taken from the G3 and N3 design.<ref name=\"PrestonB\"/><ref name=\"referenceD\">Brown 1999, p. </ref>\n\nThe machinery was of necessity limited in weight, size and installed power, and there were only two shafts with quite large screws. All previous British battleships since {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} of 1906 had four screws as did all British battleship classes after ''Nelson''. In order that flue gasses be kept clear of the superstructure, the boiler rooms were moved behind the engine rooms, exhausting into a single funnel. This orientation also reduced the overall length of the armoured citadel. As a countermeasure to the limited power, the hull was of a very efficient hydrodynamic form, to attain the best possible speed.<ref name=\"referenceD\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe ''Nelson''s had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|660|ft|m|1}} and an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|709|ft|10|in|m|1}} (''Nelson'') or {{convert|710|ft|3|in|m|1}} (''Rodney''), a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|106|ft|m|1}}, and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|30|ft|4|in|m|1}} at mean [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]]. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|33300|-|33730|LT|t}} at standard load and {{convert|37430|-|37780|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. Their crew numbered 1,361 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]] when serving as flagships and 1,314 as [[private ship]]s. At deep load, they had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|10.2|ft|m|1}},<ref>Burt, pp. 348\u2013349</ref> which gave them a quick [[Ship motions|roll]] between 11.2 and 13.6 seconds.<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 126\u2013127</ref> In calm weather, the ''Nelson''-class ships were very manoeuvreable, but the large surface area of the superstructure gave them a large amount of [[weather helm]] and they could be a handful in confined spaces with a strong wind as was demonstrated when {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} ran aground off [[Southsea]] beach in 1934.<ref>Burt, pp. 350, 357\u2013359</ref> \n\nThe ships were powered by two sets of [[John Brown & Company|Brown-Curtis]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one shaft, using steam from eight [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s fitted with [[superheater]]s that operated at a pressure of {{convert|250|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The turbines were rated at {{convert|45000|shp|lk=on}} and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The [[sister ship]]s exceeded their designed speed during their [[sea trial]]s in 1927, reaching speeds of {{convert|23.6|-|23.8|kn}} from {{convert|45614|-|46031|shp|abbr=on}}. They carried {{convert|3770|-|3805|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] to give them a designed range of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 114, 124\u2013125</ref>\n\n===Armour===\nArmour weight was also reduced by using an internal, inclined armour belt sloped outward at 72 degrees vertically, {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick over the main magazines and control positions to {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on}} over the machinery and 6-inch gun magazines. The slope increased the relative thickness of the belt to a plunging projectile. Water-filled compartments, surrounded by air-filled ones, formed internal torpedo bulges which were fitted between the armour and the external hull of the ship, which was not armoured. The outer hull plating was meant to initiate detonation of shells which would then explode outside the armour. This innovation dispensed with external torpedo bulges which would otherwise have reduced the speed of the ships due to drag. The armour scheme was of the \"[[All or nothing (armour)|all or nothing]]\" principle; areas were either well protected, from the front of \"A\" barbette rearwards to the after 6-inch turrets, or were not protected at all, disposing of the multiple intermediate thickness of armour seen in older designs. For the first time a British battleship had a single, {{convert|6.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick armoured deck to protect against plunging shells and aircraft-launched bombs, with {{convert|4.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} armour over the stern, both on top of the 0.5 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) deck plating. The main turrets had {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} Non-cemented (NC) armour on the faces, {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the sides, {{convert|7.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the roof and {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the rear with {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} around the barbettes. The secondary turrets, however, had only {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} NC all round over 0.5 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) structural steel plates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"referenceD\"/>\n\n===Superstructure===\nThe large superstructure which was octagonal in plan, was known to its crew as the \"Octopoidal\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''HMS Rodney'', Iain Ballantyne, Pen & Sword Books, {{ISBN|978 1 84415 406 7}}</ref> and was sometimes referred to as \"[[Queen Anne's Mansions]]\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Burt, p. </ref> due to its similarity to a 14-storey brick residential development opposite [[St. James's Park tube station]] in London. The superstructure provided spacious, weatherproof working spaces for the navigating officers and any flag officers embarked. This innovative bridge design was subsequently copied by the French in the [[Dunkerque-class_battleship|''Dunkerque''-class]] battleships, as was the all-forward main armament orientation, both features which were repeated in the [[Richelieu-class_battleship|''Richelieu''-class]] designs.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">''French Battleships 1922-1956'', John Jordan & Robert Dumas, Seaforth Publishing, {{ISBN|978 1 84832 034 5}}</ref> Except for the emergency conning tower at its base, and the trunking for the main gun directors mounted on top, the superstructure was lightly armoured against splinters only, to save weight. Additional weight-saving design measures included the use of light materials such as aluminium for fittings, and [[fir]] instead of [[teak]] for deck planking, although subsequently, teak decks were fitted in the late 1920s, following concerns that the ships could not fire a full broadside without causing structural damage to the decks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe ''Nelson'' class was a revolutionary but compromised design, and unsurprisingly there were shortcomings. The location of the superstructure towards the stern caused manoeuvrability problems in high winds, especially when steaming at low speeds, where the superstructure acted somewhat like a [[mizzen]] [[sail]] permanently set, causing the ships to \"weathervane\" but according to Captain [[Hugh Binney]], who commanded ''Nelson'' in the late twenties, \"if this is kept in mind, no real difficulties should be encountered in any circumstances\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was potentially a problem in crowded harbours, and made the ships somewhat difficult to dock and embark although this issue never led to a major incident. Binney also stated \"In the early stages of the ship's first commission, there was a general misconception that the ''Nelson'' class were unhandy and difficult to manoeuvre. Both my predecessor and myself, however, very soon discovered that this opinion was entirely fallacious! In calm weather, the ship's manoeuvring capabilities are in no way inferior, and in many ways superior to those of ''Queen Elizabeth'' or ''Revenge''.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They could also be awkward to manoeuvre when moving astern. This was attributed to the ships having a single, central rudder which was out of the propeller race of the twin screws. At sea, however, they were reported to handle well, with a comparatively small Tactical Diameter (turning circle) particularly when turning into the wind, according to Lt. Cmdr. [[Galfry Gatacre]] RAN (later Rear Admiral), who served in 1941\u20131942 as the Navigator for both ''Nelson'' and subsequently ''Rodney''. He reported no difficulty in navigating either ship through the boom gates at [[Scapa Flow]].  ''Nelson'' and ''Rodney'' were the only battleships never to have bumped the boom gate vessel as they passed through Hoxa Sound.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:HMS Nelson during gunnery trials.jpg|thumb|left|''Nelson'' fires a salvo during gunnery trials in 1942]]\nTheir main armament of nine {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns were mounted in triple turrets, the only RN battleships designed in this manner. The guns themselves deviated from standard British designs. Where previous RN weapons fired heavy shells at a moderate velocity, the ''Nelson''{{'}}s weapons followed the German practice of a lighter shell at a higher velocity. This change in Director of Naval Ordnance policy was due to British testing of surrendered German equipment after World War I, although much later, subsequent testing proved contradictory. Two different rifling rates were tried, and for some time there was a mixture of barrel types in different turrets, even sometimes within the same turret. The guns suffered considerable barrel wear and had a fairly large dispersion pattern, due mainly to the different riflings that each barrel had as they were refurbished over their lifespan. To compensate for barrel wear, muzzle velocities were reduced and a heavier (longer) shell was tried to offset this; but the cost of producing new shells, modifying shell handling and storage equipment came at a time when RN funding had been heavily reduced. Nevertheless, these weapons were not generally considered by the RN to be as successful as the previous [[BL 15 inch /42 naval gun|BL 15&nbsp;inch Mark I]]; the [[BL 14-inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 14-inch Mark VII]], fitted to the subsequent ''King George V''-class battleships, returned to a heavier (relatively) shell and lower velocity, but its performance was compromised by an over-complex mounting that proved to have reliability defects in combat. The need to reduce displacement led to the use of triple mount turrets, which had early problems with the ammunition handling and loading machinery. The heavier weight of the triple in comparison to a twin turret meant increased stresses on the roller bearings when training the turrets. This was solved by the incorporation of spring-loaded vertical as well as conventional horizontal roller bearings. The triple mount turret proved itself when, in October 1929, a turret crew with two years' experience loaded and fired 33 consecutive rounds without mishap.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The incorporation of many safety features, achieved with lighter materials, meant that the complex and relatively fragile equipment had to be serviced regularly over the ships' lifetime. These ships were fitted with the [[HACS]] AA fire control system and the [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]] Mk I for surface fire control of the main armament.\n\nFiring trials revealed that the blast of 'A' and 'B' turrets on forward bearings caused damage to many weather-deck fittings and conditions on the mess-decks became very uncomfortable. When 'X' turret was fired 30 degrees abaft the beam and elevation of 40 degrees, considerable damage occurred to the vertically stacked two rows of bridge windows.<ref>Raven & Roberts, p. 118</ref> As a result, the guns of \"X\" turret were usually prohibited from firing abaft of the beam at high elevations during peacetime practice firing. Fitting [[tempered glass]] in the bridge windows was tried, but gun blast still shattered some of them and filled the bridge with flying debris. The design of the Captain's bridge was altered on Nelson circa 1930-33 to reduce the window area and enclose the upper portion of the previous two rows of glass. A great deal of effort was expended in correcting this problem, and fitting of protective ledges below the new smaller windows proved successful. A new enclosed Admiral's bridge with its requisite reduced windows was built on top of the Captain's bridge and the forward signalling lamps were moved up one level and towards the aft of the bridge. The Admiral's bridge on Rodney remained stepped back somewhat from the forward edge of the tower, but the Captain's bridge had the same reduced area of glass that Nelson now had, with larger ledges.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Blast was also a problem elsewhere; D.K. Brown tells of a test firing that was suspended when DNC observer H.S. Pengelly, who was beneath the foredeck, reported a bright red flash after firing all guns in \"A\" turret. This was later discovered to be caused by concussion of the observers' eyeballs.<ref name=\"referenceD\"/>\n\nIn the final phase of the action against ''Bismarck'', ''Rodney'' fired a pair of 24.5-inch torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit.<ref>''Reports of Proceedings 1921-1964'', G.G.O.

Geography accordingly bounds its neighborhoods. These ridges consist of upper Stonehenge limestone. Many of the older buildings were built from this stone, which is easily quarried and dressed onsite. It whitens in weathering and the [[Conglomerate (geology)#Clast composition|edgewise conglomerate]] and wavy laminae become distinctly visible, giving a handsome and uniquely \u201c[[Cumberland Valley]]\u201d appearance. Several of Hagerstown's churches are constructed of Stonehenge limestone and its value and beauty as building rock may be seen particularly in [[Saint John's Church (Hagerstown, Maryland)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] on West Antietam Street and the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Washington and Prospect Streets. Brick and concrete eventually displaced this native stone in the construction process.<ref>Ray Smith Bass, State of Maryland Geological Survey, Cambrian and Ordovician Deposits of Maryland (1919) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3m7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=stonehenge+Hagerstown+St.+John's&hl=en&ei=HTKgTeXGNe6z0QHkk837BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stonehenge%20Hagerstown%20St.%20John's&f=false 99].</ref>\n\nHagerstown anchors the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which lies just northwest of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area]] in the heart of the [[Great Appalachian Valley]].

Interstates [[Interstate 81|81]] and [[Interstate 70|70]], [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Winchester and Western Railroad|Winchester and Western]] railroads, and [[Hagerstown Regional Airport]] form an extensive transportation network for the city. Hagerstown is also the chief commercial and industrial hub for a greater Tri-State Area that includes much of Western Maryland as well as significant portions of [[South Central Pennsylvania|South Central]] [[Pennsylvania]] and the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]] of [[West Virginia]].

In 1762, Hager officially founded the town of Elizabethtown which he named after his wife, Elizabeth Kershner. Fourteen years later, Jonathan Hager became known as the \"Father of Washington County\" after his efforts helped Hagerstown become the county seat of newly created Washington County, which Hager also helped create from neighboring [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. The City Council changed the community's name to Hager's-Town in 1813 because the name had gained popular usage, and in the following year, the [[Maryland State Legislature]] officially endorsed the changing of the town's name.<ref name=\"Hag2\" /><ref name=\"Maryland State Archives\">{{cite book|title=Laws Made and Passed by the General Assembly of the State of Maryland, at a Session Begun and Held at the City of Annapolis, on Monday, the Sixth Day of December, Eighteen Hundred and Thirteen, and Ending Monday, the Thirty First Day of January, in the Year of Our Lord, Eighteen Hundred and Fourteen|date=1814|publisher=Printed By Jehu Chandler|location=Annapolis|pages=108\u2013113|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000632/html/am632--108.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|ref=\u201cAn act to alter and change the name of Elizabeth-Town, in Washington county, to Hager's-Town, and to incorporate the same,\u201d Chapter 121, passed Jan. 26, 1814}}</ref>\n\nIn 1794, government forces arrested 150 citizens during a [[riot|draft riot]] which was staged by protesters in response to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/rev_war/whiskey.htm|title=How Whiskey Almost Started a War|website=Emmitsburg.net|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\nHagerstown's strategic location at the border between the North and the South made the city a primary staging area and supply center for four major campaigns during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1861, General [[Robert Patterson]]'s troops used Hagerstown as a base to attack [[Virginia]] troops in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. In the [[Maryland Campaign]] of 1862, General [[James Longstreet]]'s command occupied the town while en route to the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. In 1863, the city was the site of several military incursions and engagements as Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army invaded and retreated in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. In 1864, Hagerstown was invaded by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Lt. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]. On Wednesday, July 6, Early sent 1,500 cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John McCausland]], into Hagerstown. The Confederates levied a ransom of $20,000 and a large amount of clothing,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.whilbr.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16715coll9|title=Hagerstown Herald and Torch Light|date=July 20, 1864|publisher=Western Maryland Historical Library|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> in retribution for [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] destruction of farms, feed and cattle in the [[Shenandoah Valley]].  This is in contrast to neighboring [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], which McCausland razed on July 30 when the borough failed to supply the requested ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold.\n\nFollowing the war, in 1872 Maryland and Virginia cooperated to re-inter Confederate dead from their impromptu graves to cemeteries in Hagerstown, Frederick and [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]]. Roughly 60% however, remained unidentified. In 1877, 15 years after the [[Battle of Antietam]], also known as the Battle of [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], approximately 2,800 Confederate dead from that battle and also from the battles on South Mountain were re-interred in [[Washington Confederate Cemetery]], within Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown.<ref>[http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html The Crossroads of the Civil War - Hagerstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101112954/http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html |date=2007-11-01 }}, Hagerstown-Washington County Convention & Visitor's Bureau, Civil War, Retrieved 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.whilbr.org/WashingtonConfederateCemetery/index.aspx Washington Confederate Cemetery, Hagerstown, Maryland], Western Maryland Historical Library, Retrieved 2014.</ref>\n\n===Railroads===\nHagerstown's nickname of the \"Hub City\" originated from the large number of railroads (and roads) that served the city. Hagerstown was the center of the [[Western Maryland Railway]] and an important city on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]], [[Norfolk and Western Railway|Norfolk and Western]], [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]], and Hagerstown and Frederick Railroads. Currently, the city is a vital location on [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Winchester and Western Railroad]]s.\n\nHagerstown was formerly served by the [[Hagerstown & Frederick Railway]], an [[interurban]] [[tram|trolley]] system, from 1896 to 1947.\n\n===Little Heiskell===\n[[Image:Little heiskell.png|thumb|right|The weathervane known as \"Little Heiskell\", a symbol of the city of Hagerstown, Maryland.]]\nOne of the most recognizable symbols of Hagerstown is the [[weathervane]] known as \"Little Heiskell\". Named after the German tinsmith Benjamin Heiskell who crafted it in 1769 in the form of a [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldier]],<ref name=\"Hag2\" /> it stood atop the Market House first and City Hall second for a combined 166 years. It was moved from the Market House to City Hall in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, the weathervane gained its characteristic bullet hole from a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sharpshooter, who won a bet after shooting it from a full city block away.\n\nIn 1935, the original was retired to the Museum of the Washington County Historical Society, later to be moved to its present display in the Jonathan Hager House. An exact replica has replaced it atop City Hall.\n\nThe weathervane has been depicted in the city's annual Mummers Day Parade by Charles Harry Rittenhouse, Sr. sporting the necessary accoutrements of a [[Germany|German]] [[mercenary]] soldier.\n\nLittle Heiskell was at one time the mascot of [[North Hagerstown High School]].\n\n===Aviation heritage===\nHagerstown's first aircraft production came in World War I with the [[Maryland Pressed Steel Company]] building the [[Bellanca CD]] biplane in hopes of securing government contracts.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1984, [[Fairchild Aircraft]] was based in Hagerstown and was by far the area's most prominent employer. The importance of the company to the city and the country as a whole earned Hagerstown its former nickname \"Home of the Flying Boxcar\".\n\nFairchild moved to Hagerstown from [[Farmingdale, New York]], in 1931 after Sherman Fairchild purchased a majority stock interest in [[Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company]] of Hagerstown in 1929. Among Fairchild's products during World War II were [[PT-19]]/[[PT-23]]/[[PT-26]] (Cornell) and [[AT-21]] trainers, [[C-82 Packet|C-82]] \"Packet\" cargo planes and missiles. At its height in World War II, Fairchild employed directly and indirectly up to 80% of Hagerstown's workforce or roughly 10,000 people.\n\nIn the postwar era, Fairchild continued to produce aircraft in Hagerstown such as [[C-123 Provider]], [[Fairchild F-27]] and [[Fairchild Hiller FH-227]], [[FH-1100]], [[C-26 Metroliner]], [[UC-26 Metroliner]], [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], and the [[Fairchild T-46]] jet trainer.[[Image:Hgrterminal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Passenger terminal at [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]].]]\nAll production ceased in Hagerstown in 1984 and the company moved elsewhere. Presently, the company is based in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and after a series of mergers and acquisitions, is known as [[M7 Aerospace]].\n\nThe Hagerstown Aviation Museum shows many of these original aircraft. Among the ones on display are: 1939 F24/UC-61C, 1945 C-82A, 1943 PT-19A, and the 1953 [[C-119]].<ref>[[Fairchild Aircraft]], Retrieved 2007.</ref> The museum is located near Hagerstown Regional Airport in the airport's former terminal.\n\nHagerstown is also the birthplace of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]-based [[Piedmont Airlines]] which started out as Henson Aviation. It was founded by [[Richard A. Henson]] in 1931. Today, [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]] is named as such in honor of the airlines' founder.\n\nToday, only small to medium-sized aviation companies remain in the area, e.g., [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]], a defense electronics engineering and manufacturing contractor.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location and topography===\nHagerstown is located at {{Coord|39|38|34|N|77|43|12|W|type:city}} (39.642771, &minus;77.719954).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is situated south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] and north of the [[Potomac River]] and between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in a part of the Great Appalachian Valley known regionally as [[Cumberland Valley]] and locally as [[Hagerstown Valley]].

Geography accordingly bounds its neighborhoods. These ridges consist of upper Stonehenge limestone. Many of the older buildings were built from this stone, which is easily quarried and dressed onsite. It whitens in weathering and the [[Conglomerate (geology)#Clast composition|edgewise conglomerate]] and wavy laminae become distinctly visible, giving a handsome and uniquely \u201c[[Cumberland Valley]]\u201d appearance. Several of Hagerstown's churches are constructed of Stonehenge limestone and its value and beauty as building rock may be seen particularly in [[Saint John's Church (Hagerstown, Maryland)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] on West Antietam Street and the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Washington and Prospect Streets. Brick and concrete eventually displaced this native stone in the construction process.<ref>Ray Smith Bass, State of Maryland Geological Survey, Cambrian and Ordovician Deposits of Maryland (1919) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3m7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=stonehenge+Hagerstown+St.+John's&hl=en&ei=HTKgTeXGNe6z0QHkk837BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stonehenge%20Hagerstown%20St.%20John's&f=false 99].</ref>\n\nHagerstown anchors the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which lies just northwest of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area]] in the heart of the [[Great Appalachian Valley]].

In 1762, Hager officially founded the town of Elizabethtown which he named after his wife, Elizabeth Kershner. Fourteen years later, Jonathan Hager became known as the \"Father of Washington County\" after his efforts helped Hagerstown become the county seat of newly created Washington County, which Hager also helped create from neighboring [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. The City Council changed the community's name to Hager's-Town in 1813 because the name had gained popular usage, and in the following year, the [[Maryland State Legislature]] officially endorsed the changing of the town's name.<ref name=\"Hag2\" /><ref name=\"Maryland State Archives\">{{cite book|title=Laws Made and Passed by the General Assembly of the State of Maryland, at a Session Begun and Held at the City of Annapolis, on Monday, the Sixth Day of December, Eighteen Hundred and Thirteen, and Ending Monday, the Thirty First Day of January, in the Year of Our Lord, Eighteen Hundred and Fourteen|date=1814|publisher=Printed By Jehu Chandler|location=Annapolis|pages=108\u2013113|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000632/html/am632--108.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|ref=\u201cAn act to alter and change the name of Elizabeth-Town, in Washington county, to Hager's-Town, and to incorporate the same,\u201d Chapter 121, passed Jan. 26, 1814}}</ref>\n\nIn 1794, government forces arrested 150 citizens during a [[riot|draft riot]] which was staged by protesters in response to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/rev_war/whiskey.htm|title=How Whiskey Almost Started a War|website=Emmitsburg.net|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\nHagerstown's strategic location at the border between the North and the South made the city a primary staging area and supply center for four major campaigns during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1861, General [[Robert Patterson]]'s troops used Hagerstown as a base to attack [[Virginia]] troops in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. In the [[Maryland Campaign]] of 1862, General [[James Longstreet]]'s command occupied the town while en route to the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. In 1863, the city was the site of several military incursions and engagements as Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army invaded and retreated in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. In 1864, Hagerstown was invaded by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Lt. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]. On Wednesday, July 6, Early sent 1,500 cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John McCausland]], into Hagerstown.

This is in contrast to neighboring [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], which McCausland razed on July 30 when the borough failed to supply the requested ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold.\n\nFollowing the war, in 1872 Maryland and Virginia cooperated to re-inter Confederate dead from their impromptu graves to cemeteries in Hagerstown, Frederick and [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]]. Roughly 60% however, remained unidentified. In 1877, 15 years after the [[Battle of Antietam]], also known as the Battle of [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], approximately 2,800 Confederate dead from that battle and also from the battles on South Mountain were re-interred in [[Washington Confederate Cemetery]], within Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown.<ref>[http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html The Crossroads of the Civil War - Hagerstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101112954/http://www.marylandmemories.org/civil_war.html |date=2007-11-01 }}, Hagerstown-Washington County Convention & Visitor's Bureau, Civil War, Retrieved 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.whilbr.org/WashingtonConfederateCemetery/index.aspx Washington Confederate Cemetery, Hagerstown, Maryland], Western Maryland Historical Library, Retrieved 2014.</ref>\n\n===Railroads===\nHagerstown's nickname of the \"Hub City\" originated from the large number of railroads (and roads) that served the city. Hagerstown was the center of the [[Western Maryland Railway]] and an important city on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]], [[Norfolk and Western Railway|Norfolk and Western]], [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]], and Hagerstown and Frederick Railroads. Currently, the city is a vital location on [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Winchester and Western Railroad]]s.\n\nHagerstown was formerly served by the [[Hagerstown & Frederick Railway]], an [[interurban]] [[tram|trolley]] system, from 1896 to 1947.\n\n===Little Heiskell===\n[[Image:Little heiskell.png|thumb|right|The weathervane known as \"Little Heiskell\", a symbol of the city of Hagerstown, Maryland.]]\nOne of the most recognizable symbols of Hagerstown is the [[weathervane]] known as \"Little Heiskell\". Named after the German tinsmith Benjamin Heiskell who crafted it in 1769 in the form of a [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldier]],<ref name=\"Hag2\" /> it stood atop the Market House first and City Hall second for a combined 166 years. It was moved from the Market House to City Hall in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, the weathervane gained its characteristic bullet hole from a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sharpshooter, who won a bet after shooting it from a full city block away.\n\nIn 1935, the original was retired to the Museum of the Washington County Historical Society, later to be moved to its present display in the Jonathan Hager House. An exact replica has replaced it atop City Hall.\n\nThe weathervane has been depicted in the city's annual Mummers Day Parade by Charles Harry Rittenhouse, Sr. sporting the necessary accoutrements of a [[Germany|German]] [[mercenary]] soldier.\n\nLittle Heiskell was at one time the mascot of [[North Hagerstown High School]].\n\n===Aviation heritage===\nHagerstown's first aircraft production came in World War I with the [[Maryland Pressed Steel Company]] building the [[Bellanca CD]] biplane in hopes of securing government contracts.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1984, [[Fairchild Aircraft]] was based in Hagerstown and was by far the area's most prominent employer. The importance of the company to the city and the country as a whole earned Hagerstown its former nickname \"Home of the Flying Boxcar\".\n\nFairchild moved to Hagerstown from [[Farmingdale, New York]], in 1931 after Sherman Fairchild purchased a majority stock interest in [[Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company]] of Hagerstown in 1929. Among Fairchild's products during World War II were [[PT-19]]/[[PT-23]]/[[PT-26]] (Cornell) and [[AT-21]] trainers, [[C-82 Packet|C-82]] \"Packet\" cargo planes and missiles. At its height in World War II, Fairchild employed directly and indirectly up to 80% of Hagerstown's workforce or roughly 10,000 people.\n\nIn the postwar era, Fairchild continued to produce aircraft in Hagerstown such as [[C-123 Provider]], [[Fairchild F-27]] and [[Fairchild Hiller FH-227]], [[FH-1100]], [[C-26 Metroliner]], [[UC-26 Metroliner]], [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], and the [[Fairchild T-46]] jet trainer.[[Image:Hgrterminal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Passenger terminal at [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]].]]\nAll production ceased in Hagerstown in 1984 and the company moved elsewhere. Presently, the company is based in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and after a series of mergers and acquisitions, is known as [[M7 Aerospace]].\n\nThe Hagerstown Aviation Museum shows many of these original aircraft. Among the ones on display are: 1939 F24/UC-61C, 1945 C-82A, 1943 PT-19A, and the 1953 [[C-119]].<ref>[[Fairchild Aircraft]], Retrieved 2007.</ref> The museum is located near Hagerstown Regional Airport in the airport's former terminal.\n\nHagerstown is also the birthplace of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]-based [[Piedmont Airlines]] which started out as Henson Aviation. It was founded by [[Richard A. Henson]] in 1931. Today, [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field]] is named as such in honor of the airlines' founder.\n\nToday, only small to medium-sized aviation companies remain in the area, e.g., [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]], a defense electronics engineering and manufacturing contractor.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location and topography===\nHagerstown is located at {{Coord|39|38|34|N|77|43|12|W|type:city}} (39.642771, &minus;77.719954).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is situated south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] and north of the [[Potomac River]] and between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in a part of the Great Appalachian Valley known regionally as [[Cumberland Valley]] and locally as [[Hagerstown Valley]].

For economic reasons, it closed bureaus in [[Austin]], [[Miami]], and [[Chicago]] in 2006.<ref name=\"variety\" /><ref name=\"twp\" />\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''People'' has been attributed to [[Andrew Heiskell]], Time Inc.'s chief executive officer at the time and the former publisher of the weekly [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.

Due to its success, the frequency of ''People Stylewatch'' was increased to 10 times per year in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In spring 2017, People Stylewatch was rebranded as PeopleStyle. In late 2017, it was announced that there would no longer be a print version of PeopleStyle and it would be a digital-only publication.\n\nIn Australia, the localized version of ''People'' is titled ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]'' because of a pre-existing [[lad's mag]] published under the title ''[[People (Australian magazine)|People]]''.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.

Due to its success, the frequency of ''People Stylewatch'' was increased to 10 times per year in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In spring 2017, People Stylewatch was rebranded as PeopleStyle. In late 2017, it was announced that there would no longer be a print version of PeopleStyle and it would be a digital-only publication.\n\nIn Australia, the localized version of ''People'' is titled ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]'' because of a pre-existing [[lad's mag]] published under the title ''[[People (Australian magazine)|People]]''.

It served as the colonial capital of the then Warri Province. It shares boundaries with [[Ughelli]]/[[Agbarho]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Okpe]], [[Udu]] and [[Uvwie]] although most of these places, notably Udu, Okpe and Uvwie, have been integrated to the larger cosmopolitan Warri. [[Osubi]] houses an airport that serves the city. [[Effurun]] serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city.\n\nThe name ''Warri province'' was once applicable to the part of an area now called [[Delta State]] under the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]]. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and [[Aboh]], with [[For\u00e7ados River]] in the Southeast and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to [[Niger Delta Basin|Delta Province]]. Warri city is one of the major hubs of [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|petroleum activities and businesses in the southern Nigeria]]. It is a commercial capital city of Delta State, with a population of over 311,970 people according to the national population census figures for 2006.<ref name=\"nigeria gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075911/http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city is one of cosmopolitan cities in southern Nigeria comprising originally of [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]], [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people. Warri is predominantly Christian with mixture of African traditional religions like most of the Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique [[Nigerian Pidgin|Pidgin English]].\n\n==History==\n\nWarri was once a provincial capital to British rule. The Lagos and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was formally united as Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria on 28 February 1906 and Walter Egerton was appointed as the Governor of new Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, holding office until 1912.[3] In the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at Warri and an Eastern Province with capital at Calabar.\n\nWarri sits on the bank of River Warri which joined River Forcados and River Escravos through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport which serves as the cargo transit point between the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export. The city's history dates back to the 15th century, when it was visited by Portuguese missionaries. Subsequently, it served as the base for Portuguese and Dutch [[slave traders]]. Warri became a more important port city during the late 19th century, when it became a centre for the [[palm oil]] trade and other major items such as [[rubber]], palm products, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnut]]s, hides, and skins.<ref name=\"greatest cities\">http://www.greatestcities.com/Africa/Nigeria/Warri_city.html</ref>\n\nWarri was then established as a provincial headquarters by the British in the early 20th century.<ref name=ekeh>{{Cite book|last= Ekeh|first=Peter Palmer |title=Warri City and British Colonial Rule in Western Niger Delta |year=2005 |publisher=Urhobo Historical Society |isbn=978-064-924-7 |pages=31 |authorlink= Peter Palmer Ekeh}}</ref> There have been a tremendous growth in the population; it has grown from being a rural area to an urban area.\n\n==Demographics==\nWarri is regarded as a modern metropolitan area with expanded infrastructural development in other local government areas such as [[Uvwie]], [[Udu]], and [[Okpe]] in recent years, with various road networks linking these places into one. Each of these areas has its own administrative structure.  Warri City is residence to four monarchs namely the Olu of Warri (Itsekiri), Orosuen (Ovie) of the Okere-Urhobo Kingdom (Urhobo), the Ovie of Agbarha Kingdom (Urhobo) and the Pere of Ogbe Ijaw Kingdom (Ijaw).\n\nThe major people in Warri comprise the [[Urhobo people|Urhobos]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaws]] and [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiris]]. However, due to its urban status, there is a large influx of people from all over the country, most notably the Igbos.\n\n==Climate==\nThe region experiences moderate rainfall and moderate humidity for most part of the year. The climate is monsoonal and is marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool \"harmattan\" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season.

It shares boundaries with [[Ughelli]]/[[Agbarho]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Okpe]], [[Udu]] and [[Uvwie]] although most of these places, notably Udu, Okpe and Uvwie, have been integrated to the larger cosmopolitan Warri. [[Osubi]] houses an airport that serves the city. [[Effurun]] serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city.\n\nThe name ''Warri province'' was once applicable to the part of an area now called [[Delta State]] under the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]]. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and [[Aboh]], with [[For\u00e7ados River]] in the Southeast and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to [[Niger Delta Basin|Delta Province]]. Warri city is one of the major hubs of [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|petroleum activities and businesses in the southern Nigeria]].

Warri is predominantly Christian with mixture of African traditional religions like most of the Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique [[Nigerian Pidgin|Pidgin English]].\n\n==History==\n\nWarri was once a provincial capital to British rule. The Lagos and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was formally united as Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria on 28 February 1906 and Walter Egerton was appointed as the Governor of new Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, holding office until 1912.[3] In the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at Warri and an Eastern Province with capital at Calabar.\n\nWarri sits on the bank of River Warri which joined River Forcados and River Escravos through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport which serves as the cargo transit point between the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export. The city's history dates back to the 15th century, when it was visited by Portuguese missionaries. Subsequently, it served as the base for Portuguese and Dutch [[slave traders]]. Warri became a more important port city during the late 19th century, when it became a centre for the [[palm oil]] trade and other major items such as [[rubber]], palm products, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnut]]s, hides, and skins.<ref name=\"greatest cities\">http://www.greatestcities.com/Africa/Nigeria/Warri_city.html</ref>\n\nWarri was then established as a provincial headquarters by the British in the early 20th century.<ref name=ekeh>{{Cite book|last= Ekeh|first=Peter Palmer |title=Warri City and British Colonial Rule in Western Niger Delta |year=2005 |publisher=Urhobo Historical Society |isbn=978-064-924-7 |pages=31 |authorlink= Peter Palmer Ekeh}}</ref> There have been a tremendous growth in the population; it has grown from being a rural area to an urban area.\n\n==Demographics==\nWarri is regarded as a modern metropolitan area with expanded infrastructural development in other local government areas such as [[Uvwie]], [[Udu]], and [[Okpe]] in recent years, with various road networks linking these places into one. Each of these areas has its own administrative structure.  Warri City is residence to four monarchs namely the Olu of Warri (Itsekiri), Orosuen (Ovie) of the Okere-Urhobo Kingdom (Urhobo), the Ovie of Agbarha Kingdom (Urhobo) and the Pere of Ogbe Ijaw Kingdom (Ijaw).\n\nThe major people in Warri comprise the [[Urhobo people|Urhobos]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaws]] and [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiris]]. However, due to its urban status, there is a large influx of people from all over the country, most notably the Igbos.\n\n==Climate==\nThe region experiences moderate rainfall and moderate humidity for most part of the year. The climate is monsoonal and is marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool \"harmattan\" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season. The area is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 32.8&nbsp;\u00b0C and annual rainfall amount of 2768.8&nbsp;mm. There are high temperatures of 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. The natural vegetation is of rain forest with swamp forest in some areas. The forest is rich in timber trees, palm trees, as well as fruit trees.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Warri\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high C = 31.5\n|Feb high C = 32.2\n|Mar high C = 32.4\n|Apr high C = 32.2\n|May high C = 31.5\n|Jun high C = 30.0\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.4\n|Sep high C = 28.8\n|Oct high C = 30.0\n|Nov high C = 31.4\n|Dec high C = 31.5\n|year high C = 30.7\n|Jan mean C = 26.8\n|Feb mean C = 27.5\n|Mar mean C = 27.9\n|Apr mean C = 28.0\n|May mean C = 27.3\n|Jun mean C = 26.3\n|Jul mean C = 25.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.3\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 26.3\n|Nov mean C = 27.1\n|Dec mean C = 26.8\n|year mean C = 26.7\n|Jan low C = 22.1\n|Feb low C = 22.9\n|Mar low C = 23.5\n|Apr low C = 23.8\n|May low C = 23.1\n|Jun low C = 22.6\n|Jul low C = 21.0\n|Aug low C = 22.3\n|Sep low C = 22.3\n|Oct low C = 22.6\n|Nov low C = 22.9\n|Dec low C = 22.2\n|year low C = 22.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 30\n|Feb precipitation mm = 58\n|Mar precipitation mm = 127\n|Apr precipitation mm = 201\n|May precipitation mm = 270\n|Jun precipitation mm = 367\n|Jul precipitation mm = 474\n|Aug precipitation mm = 324\n|Sep precipitation mm = 457\n|Oct precipitation mm = 325\n|Nov precipitation mm = 104\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31\n|year precipitation mm = 2768\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.Org<ref name = Climate-Data.Org>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://en.climate-data.org/location/513/\n| title = Climate: Warri\n| publisher = [[Climate-Data.org]]\n| accessdate = 29 October 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\nThere is the Warri Refinery and Petrochemicals located at Ekpan with the majority of international and local oil companies operating in Nigeria having their operational offices close by.
