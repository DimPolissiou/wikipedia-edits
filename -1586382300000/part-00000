Skiwear that he had designed for a female friend was photographed by [[Toni Frissell]], a photographer working for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. Frissell's editor asked Pucci to design skiwear for a story on European Winter Fashion, which ran in the winter 1948 issue of the ''Bazaar''.\n\nPucci was the first person to design a one-piece [[ski suit]].<ref>[http://snow-point.com/publ/one_piece_ski_suits/the_history_of_the_one_piece_ski_sui/2-1-0-2 The history of the one piece ski suit]</ref> Although there had been some experiments with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci's sleek designs caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Instead, he left the Air Force and set up an [[haute couture]] house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]].\n\nInitially, he used his knowledge of stretch fabrics to produce a swimwear line in 1949, but he soon moved onto other items such as brightly coloured, boldly patterned silk scarves. [[Stanley Marcus]] of [[Neiman Marcus]] encouraged him to use the designs in blouses and then a popular line of wrinkle-free printed silk dresses.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Pucci added a boutique in Rome as business thrived, helped by Capri's role as a destination for the international [[jet set]]. By the early 1950s, Pucci was achieving international recognition, receiving the ''Neiman-Marcus Award'' in Dallas and the ''Burdine's Sunshine Award'' in Miami. By the 1960s Pucci was further thrust into greater status when [[Marilyn Monroe]] became a fan. She was photographed by George Barris in a number of his items in what would be some of her final photographs.\n\n[[File:Emilio Pucci silk cocktail dress, 1970s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1970s Emilio Pucci [[cocktail dress]] sold at [[Frederick & Nelson]] in Seattle.]]\nAs the decade progressed his designs were worn by everyone from [[Sophia Loren]] to [[Jackie Kennedy]].

His [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] in Rome advised him to develop the line abroad, avoiding the difficulties of a decade earlier in matching available fabrics to the patterns of his first swimwear line. As a result, Pucci came to [[Chicago]] giving the lingerie contract to [[Formfit]]-Rogers mills. The venture proved to be successful, and Pucci was made vice president in charge of design and merchandising for the company a year later.\n\nIn February 1959, he married Cristina Nannini from Rome about whom he later remarked, \"I married a [[Botticelli]]\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Settembrini|first=Luigi|last2=Katell Le Bourhis|first2=Stefania Ricci|year=1996|title=Emilio Pucci ([[Florence Biennale]])|publisher=Skira Editore|isbn=978-88-8118-176-6 }}</ref> They had two children, Alessandro and Laudomia.

Skiwear that he had designed for a female friend was photographed by [[Toni Frissell]], a photographer working for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. Frissell's editor asked Pucci to design skiwear for a story on European Winter Fashion, which ran in the winter 1948 issue of the ''Bazaar''.\n\nPucci was the first person to design a one-piece [[ski suit]].<ref>[http://snow-point.com/publ/one_piece_ski_suits/the_history_of_the_one_piece_ski_sui/2-1-0-2 The history of the one piece ski suit]</ref> Although there had been some experiments with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci's sleek designs caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Instead, he left the Air Force and set up an [[haute couture]] house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]].\n\nInitially, he used his knowledge of stretch fabrics to produce a swimwear line in 1949, but he soon moved onto other items such as brightly coloured, boldly patterned silk scarves. [[Stanley Marcus]] of [[Neiman Marcus]] encouraged him to use the designs in blouses and then a popular line of wrinkle-free printed silk dresses.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Pucci added a boutique in Rome as business thrived, helped by Capri's role as a destination for the international [[jet set]]. By the early 1950s, Pucci was achieving international recognition, receiving the ''Neiman-Marcus Award'' in Dallas and the ''Burdine's Sunshine Award'' in Miami. By the 1960s Pucci was further thrust into greater status when [[Marilyn Monroe]] became a fan. She was photographed by George Barris in a number of his items in what would be some of her final photographs.\n\n[[File:Emilio Pucci silk cocktail dress, 1970s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1970s Emilio Pucci [[cocktail dress]] sold at [[Frederick & Nelson]] in Seattle.]]\nAs the decade progressed his designs were worn by everyone from [[Sophia Loren]] to [[Jackie Kennedy]].

As a result, Pucci came to [[Chicago]] giving the lingerie contract to [[Formfit]]-Rogers mills.

There were two designs of the \"bubble helmet\" that was dubbed RainDome by Braniff and Bola and Space Helmet by Emilio Pucci.

The song was first sung at the twenty-seventh session of the Indian National Congress, Calcutta on 28 December 1911 as the opening song at the beginning of the day's proceedings.

The poem was published in February 1905 under the title ''Bharat Bhagya Bidhata'' in the Tatwabodhini Patrika, which was the official publication of the Brahmo Samaj with Tagore then the Editor.\n\nIn 1912 Song was performed by Sarala Devi Chowdhurani, Tagore's niece, along with a group of school students, in front of prominent Congress members like Bishan Narayan Dhar, Indian National Congress President, and Ambika Charan Majumdar.\n\nOutside of Calcutta, the song was first sung by the bard himself at a session in [[Besant Theosophical College]] in Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh on 28 February 1919 when Tagore visited the college and sung the song. The song enthralled the college students while [[Margaret Cousins]], then vice-principal of the college (also an expert in European music and wife of Irish poet James Cousins), both requested Tagore to create an English translation of the song and set down the musical notation to the national anthem, which is followed only when the song is sung in the original slow rendition style. Tagore translated the work into English while at the college on 28 February 1919, titled {{cite wikisource |title=The Morning Song of India}} The college adopted Tagore's translation of the song as their prayer song which is sung till today.\n\n[[File:Jana Gana Mana 1942 performance with introduction.mp3|right|thumb|Jana Gana Mana played as national anthem on September 11, 1942 in Hamburg]]\n\nThe song was selected as national anthem by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] while he was in Germany.

On 30 November 2016, to instill \"committed patriotism and nationalism\", the Supreme Court ordered that all cinemas nationwide must play the national anthem, accompanied by an image of the flag of India, before all films.

On 10 February 2017, two Kashmiris (which included an employee of the state government) were arrested under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act for not standing during the anthem at a cinema, in the first such arrest of its kind made by a state government.

A resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanimously.\" (''Indian'', Dec. 29, 1911)</blockquote>\n\nMany historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in British Indian press since a different song, \"Badshah Humara\" written in [[Hindi]] by Rambhuj Chaudhary,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacw.net/DC/CommunalismCollection/ArticlesArchive/pkDatta092004.html |title= India: Are we still singing for the Empire? |accessdate= |work=Pradip Kumar Datta}}</ref> was sung on the same occasion in praise of the monarch. The nationalist Indian press stated this difference of events clearly:\n<blockquote>\n\"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V.\" (''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', Dec.28,1911)<br>\n \"The annual session of Congress began by singing a song composed by the great Bengali poet Ravindranath Tagore. Then a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V was passed. A song paying a heartfelt homage to King George V was then sung by a group of boys and girls.\" (''The Bengalee'', Dec. 28, 1911)</blockquote>\n\nEven the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:\n<blockquote>\n\"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing [[Vande Mataram]]. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Ravindranath Tagore. Messages from well-wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 10 November 1937, Tagore wrote a letter to Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography'' Ravindrajivani, volume II page 339'' by ''Prabhatkumar Mukherjee''.\n<blockquote> \"A certain high official in His Majesty's service, who was also my friend, had requested that I write a song of felicitation towards the Emperor. The request simply amazed me. It caused a great stir in my heart. In response to that great mental turmoil, I pronounced the victory in Jana Gana Mana of that Bhagya Bidhata [ed. God of Destiny] of India who has from age after age held steadfast the reins of India's chariot through rise and fall, through the straight path and the curved. That Lord of Destiny, that Reader of the Collective Mind of India, that Perennial Guide, could never be George V, George VI, or any other George. Even my official friend understood this about the song. After all, even if his admiration for the crown was excessive, he was not lacking in simple common sense.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nAgain in his letter of 19 March 1939 Tagore writes:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16241465|title=BBC News \u2013 Indian anthem Jana Gana Mana turns 100|date=27 December 2011|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind.\"\n''(Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)''\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, his clarifications on the controversy came only after the death of Emperor George V in 1936, as Tagore himself didn't want to contradict it during the lifetime of the Emperor. Further, Tagore accepted the Knighthood on Jun 3rd on the birthday of Emperor George V in 1915 for his poetry and songs. The Knighthood was bestowed to Tagore on the wish of Emperor George V, who was made to believe that the song 'Jana Gana Mana' was composed eulogising the Emperor.\n\nTagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from \"Jana Gana Mana\" lionising the Indian independence movement. He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh Massacre]]. The Knighthood (i.e. the title of 'Sir') was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for \"[[Gitanjali]]\" from the government of Sweden. Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, \"[[Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo]]\" (\"Where the Mind is Without Fear\", Gitanjali Poem #35) and \"[[Ekla Chalo Re]]\" (\"If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone\"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Regional aspects===\nAnother controversy is that only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Sind Province (1936\u201355)|Sindh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra|Maratha]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravid]] ([[South India]]), [[Odisha]]/[[Utkal]] and [[Bengal]], were mentioned. None of the princely states \u2013 [[Kashmir]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] or [[Kerala]] \u2013 or the states in [[Northeast India]], which are now integral parts of [[India]] were mentioned. But opponents of this proposition claim that [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]] mentioned only the border states of [[India]] to include complete [[India]]. Whether the [[princely state]]s would form a part of a liberated [[India|Indian republic]] was a matter of debate even till [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]]. 'Dravida' includes the people from the south (though Dravida specifically means Tamil and even then, the same consideration is not given for the south since there are many distinct people whereas in the north each of the distinct people are named) and 'Jolodhi' (Stanza 1) is Sanskrit for \"seas and oceans\". Even North-East which was under British rule or holy rivers apart from Ganges and Yamuna are not mentioned to keep the song in its rhythm. India has 28 states, 8 union territories.\n\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \"Sindh\" and substitute it with the word [[Kashmir]]. The argument was that [[Sindh]] was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the [[Partition of India|Partition]] of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \"Sindh\" refers to the [[Indus river|Indus]] and to [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] culture, and that Sindhi people are an integral part of India's cultural fabric. The [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, MLA of [[Assam]], Phani Bhushan Choudhury cited article of '[[The Times of India]]' published on 26 January 1950, stating that originally the word 'Kamarup' was included in the song, but was later changed to 'Sindhu' and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included.<ref name=at1712>[http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=dec1813/at096 ''State to seek newspaper clarification on report''.

This was met with opposition from a section of Muslim clerics on the grounds that it violated the basic principles of the Islamic centers of learning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-clerics-in-jharkhand-oppose-govt-move-on-national-anthem-in-madrasas/story-knfaLrHmoYDAucVu3LMisM.html|title=Muslim clerics in Jharkhand oppose govt move on national anthem in madrasas|date=2017-11-10|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata]]'', the poem by Rabindranath Tagore\n*''[[Vande Mataram]]'', the National Song of India\n*''[[Saare Jahan Se Achcha]]''\n*''[[Subh Sukh Chain]]'', the National Anthem of the [[Provisional Government of Free India]]\n*''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]'', the National Anthem of Bangladesh, also written by Rabindranath Tagore\n* [[Bharat Mata]]\n* [[Bangamata|Banga Mata]]\n* [[Tamil Thai]]\n* [[Telugu Thalli]]\n* [[Telangana Thalli]]\n* [[Sri Lanka Matha|Sri Lanka Mata]]\n* ''[[Bharat Mata Ki Jai]]''\n* ''[[Jai Hind]]'' \n* ''[[Hindustan Zindabad]]''\n* ''[[Inquilab Zindabad]]''\n* ''[[Jai Jawan Jai Kisan]]''\n* ''[[Joy Bangla]]''\n* ''[[Jai Maharashtra]]''\n*''[[National Anthem of Kingdom of Hyderabad]]''\n* [[National Pledge (India)|National Pledge]]\n* [[List of Indian state songs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Jana Gana Mana | b=no | n=no | q=no | s=Jana Gana Mana | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=q83099}}\n*[http://knowindia.gov.in/national-identity-elements/national-anthem.php Know India: National anthem], Government of India website\n*{{cite wikisource |title=The Morning Song of India}}English translation of the hymn \"Jana Gana Mana\" in Tagore's handwriting\n\n{{Symbols of India}}\n{{Nationalanthemsofasia}}\n{{Rabindranath Tagore}}\n\n[[Category:Bengali-language literature]]\n[[Category:Rabindra Sangeet]]\n[[Category:Indian songs]]\n[[Category:Asian anthems]]\n[[Category:National symbols of India]]\n[[Category:Indian patriotic songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Rabindranath Tagore]]\n[[Category:Bengali-language songs]]\n[[Category:History of West Bengal]]\n[[Category:History of Kolkata]]\n[[Category:Bengali music]]\n[[Category:National anthems]]\n[[Category:National anthem compositions in E-flat major]]\n[[Category:Articles containing audio clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|National anthem of India}}\n{{About|the National anthem of India}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=September 2016}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox anthem\n|transcription = \u091c\u0928 \u0917\u0923 \u092e\u0928 (Hindi) <br>\u099c\u09a8 \u0997\u09a3 \u09ae\u09a8 <small>(Bengali)</small>\n|english_title = \"Thou Art the Ruler of the Minds of All People\"\n|image = Jana Gana Mana sheet music.jpg{{!}}border\n|caption = Sheet music for \"Jana Gana Mana\"\n|prefix = National\n|country = {{IND}}\n|author =Rabindranath Tagore<ref name=\"knowindia.gov.in\">{{cite web|title=Know India-National Identity Elements-National Anthem|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/national-identity-elements/national-anthem.php}}</ref>\n|composer =Rabindranath Tagore<ref name=\"knowindia.gov.in\">{{cite web|title=Know India-National Identity Elements-National Anthem|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/national-identity-elements/national-anthem.php}}</ref>\n|lyrics_date = 1911<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|author=Rabindranath Tagore|title=The English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore: Poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsTNd7_Jt4EC&pg=PA32|year=2004|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1295-4|pages=32\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite book|author=Edgar Thorpe, Showick Thorpe|title=The Pearson CSAT Manual 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuBFs6yFRwcC&pg=PT56|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-5830-4|pages=56\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|author=Sabyasachi Bhattacharya|title=Rabindranath Tagore: An Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr8kvZ-S258C&pg=PT326|date=24 May 2017|publisher=Random House Publishers India Pvt.

The song was first sung at the twenty-seventh session of the Indian National Congress, Calcutta on 28 December 1911 as the opening song at the beginning of the day's proceedings. Thereafter it was also sung at the foundation day anniversary of Adi Brahma Samaj in February 1912 and included in their collection of psalms, Brahma Sangit.|page=206}}</ref> however, it was largely unknown except to the readers of the Adi Brahmo Samaj journal, ''[[Tattwabodhini Patrika]]''.

The song enthralled the college students while [[Margaret Cousins]], then vice-principal of the college (also an expert in European music and wife of Irish poet James Cousins), both requested Tagore to create an English translation of the song and set down the musical notation to the national anthem, which is followed only when the song is sung in the original slow rendition style. Tagore translated the work into English while at the college on 28 February 1919, titled {{cite wikisource |title=The Morning Song of India}} The college adopted Tagore's translation of the song as their prayer song which is sung till today.\n\n[[File:Jana Gana Mana 1942 performance with introduction.mp3|right|thumb|Jana Gana Mana played as national anthem on September 11, 1942 in Hamburg]]\n\nThe song was selected as national anthem by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] while he was in Germany.

On 30 November 2016, to instill \"committed patriotism and nationalism\", the Supreme Court ordered that all cinemas nationwide must play the national anthem, accompanied by an image of the flag of India, before all films. Patrons were expected to stand in respect of the anthem, and doors to a cinema hall were expected to be locked during the anthem to minimize disruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/national-anthem-national-flag-supreme-court-theater-4402827/|title=National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters, rules Supreme Court|date=2016-12-01|website=The Indian Express|language=en-IN|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> The order was controversial, as it was argued that that patrons who chose not to participate would be targeted and singled out, as was the case in an incident publicized in 2015 which purported to show a group of patrons (alleged by the [[YouTube]] uploader to be Muslims) being heckled by others. On 10 February 2017, two Kashmiris (which included an employee of the state government) were arrested under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act for not standing during the anthem at a cinema, in the first such arrest of its kind made by a state government.

They were questioned \"Are you pakistani?\". There was a debate on the issue; some lawyers recalled Article-21, some people called it a way to gain media attention and some recommended to attend the movie after the national anthem is played to avoid any problems.\" But after the debate, Supreme Court had reversed its earlier order making it mandatory for cinema halls to play the National Anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/row-over-youth-castigated-for-not-standing-up-during-national-anthem-in-cinema-hall|title=Row over youth castigated for not standing up during national anthem in cinema hall|last=|first=|date=28 October 2019|website=National Herald|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\n\n===Historical significance===\nThe composition was first sung during a convention of the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[Calcutta]] on 27 December 1911.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-chatterjee310803.htm |title= Tagore and Jana Gana Mana |accessdate= |work=Monish R. Chatterjee}}</ref> It was sung on the second day of the convention, . The event was reported thus in the British Indian press:<blockquote>\n\"The Bengali poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] sang a song composed by him specially to welcome the Emperor.\" (''Statesman'', Dec. 28, 1911)\n<br>\"The proceedings began with the singing by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] of a song specially composed by him in honour of the Emperor.\" (''Englishman'', Dec. 28, 1911)<br>\"When the proceedings of the Indian National Congress began on Wednesday 27th December 1911, a Bengali song in welcome of the Emperor was sung. A resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanimously.\" (''Indian'', Dec. 29, 1911)</blockquote>\n\nMany historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in British Indian press since a different song, \"Badshah Humara\" written in [[Hindi]] by Rambhuj Chaudhary,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacw.net/DC/CommunalismCollection/ArticlesArchive/pkDatta092004.html |title= India: Are we still singing for the Empire? |accessdate= |work=Pradip Kumar Datta}}</ref> was sung on the same occasion in praise of the monarch. The nationalist Indian press stated this difference of events clearly:\n<blockquote>\n\"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V.\" (''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', Dec.28,1911)<br>\n \"The annual session of Congress began by singing a song composed by the great Bengali poet Ravindranath Tagore. Then a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V was passed. A song paying a heartfelt homage to King George V was then sung by a group of boys and girls.\" (''The Bengalee'', Dec. 28, 1911)</blockquote>\n\nEven the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:\n<blockquote>\n\"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing [[Vande Mataram]]. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Ravindranath Tagore. Messages from well-wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 10 November 1937, Tagore wrote a letter to Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography'' Ravindrajivani, volume II page 339'' by ''Prabhatkumar Mukherjee''.\n<blockquote> \"A certain high official in His Majesty's service, who was also my friend, had requested that I write a song of felicitation towards the Emperor. The request simply amazed me. It caused a great stir in my heart. In response to that great mental turmoil, I pronounced the victory in Jana Gana Mana of that Bhagya Bidhata [ed. God of Destiny] of India who has from age after age held steadfast the reins of India's chariot through rise and fall, through the straight path and the curved. That Lord of Destiny, that Reader of the Collective Mind of India, that Perennial Guide, could never be George V, George VI, or any other George. Even my official friend understood this about the song. After all, even if his admiration for the crown was excessive, he was not lacking in simple common sense.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nAgain in his letter of 19 March 1939 Tagore writes:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16241465|title=BBC News \u2013 Indian anthem Jana Gana Mana turns 100|date=27 December 2011|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind.\"\n''(Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)''\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, his clarifications on the controversy came only after the death of Emperor George V in 1936, as Tagore himself didn't want to contradict it during the lifetime of the Emperor. Further, Tagore accepted the Knighthood on Jun 3rd on the birthday of Emperor George V in 1915 for his poetry and songs. The Knighthood was bestowed to Tagore on the wish of Emperor George V, who was made to believe that the song 'Jana Gana Mana' was composed eulogising the Emperor.\n\nTagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from \"Jana Gana Mana\" lionising the Indian independence movement. He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh Massacre]]. The Knighthood (i.e. the title of 'Sir') was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for \"[[Gitanjali]]\" from the government of Sweden. Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, \"[[Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo]]\" (\"Where the Mind is Without Fear\", Gitanjali Poem #35) and \"[[Ekla Chalo Re]]\" (\"If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone\"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Regional aspects===\nAnother controversy is that only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Sind Province (1936\u201355)|Sindh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra|Maratha]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravid]] ([[South India]]), [[Odisha]]/[[Utkal]] and [[Bengal]], were mentioned. None of the princely states \u2013 [[Kashmir]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] or [[Kerala]] \u2013 or the states in [[Northeast India]], which are now integral parts of [[India]] were mentioned. But opponents of this proposition claim that [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]] mentioned only the border states of [[India]] to include complete [[India]]. Whether the [[princely state]]s would form a part of a liberated [[India|Indian republic]] was a matter of debate even till [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]]. 'Dravida' includes the people from the south (though Dravida specifically means Tamil and even then, the same consideration is not given for the south since there are many distinct people whereas in the north each of the distinct people are named) and 'Jolodhi' (Stanza 1) is Sanskrit for \"seas and oceans\". Even North-East which was under British rule or holy rivers apart from Ganges and Yamuna are not mentioned to keep the song in its rhythm. India has 28 states, 8 union territories.\n\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \"Sindh\" and substitute it with the word [[Kashmir]]. The argument was that [[Sindh]] was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the [[Partition of India|Partition]] of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \"Sindh\" refers to the [[Indus river|Indus]] and to [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] culture, and that Sindhi people are an integral part of India's cultural fabric. The [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, MLA of [[Assam]], Phani Bhushan Choudhury cited article of '[[The Times of India]]' published on 26 January 1950, stating that originally the word 'Kamarup' was included in the song, but was later changed to 'Sindhu' and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included.<ref name=at1712>[http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=dec1813/at096 ''State to seek newspaper clarification on report''.

The league was established in 1989.<ref>[http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp Intro of CPBL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316075320/http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp |date=2009-03-16 }}</ref> CPBL eventually absorbed the competing [[Taiwan Major League]] in 2003. As of the 2020 season, the CPBL consists of five teams.\n\n==History==\nBaseball was first introduced to Taiwan during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], and gained popularity when the national little league baseball teams won numerous [[Little League World Series]] championships in the 1970s and 1980s. The [[Taiwan National Baseball Team|national baseball team]] also performed exceptionally well in many international competitions. However, the development of baseball in Taiwan was limited due to the lack of a professional league, and therefore many players were reluctant to commit to the sport.\n\nThe idea of forming a professional baseball league in Taiwan was first suggested by local [[Brother Elephants|Brother Hotel]]'s chairman Hung Teng-Sheng (\u6d2a\u9a30\u52dd). He formed his amateur Brother Hotel baseball team in 1984, and intended to professionalize his team and form a professional league within a few years. Throughout 1988 and 1989, Hung visited numerous Taiwanese businesses, trying to convince them to form professional baseball clubs. Most of his requests were rejected, but [[Wei Chuan Dragons|Wei Chuan Corporation]], [[Mercuries Tigers|Mercuries Chain Stores]], and [[Uni-President Corporation]] all supported the idea and formed teams. The Chinese Professional Baseball League was established on October 23, 1989, with Hung Teng-sheng acting as secretary-general. Because of his contribution to professional baseball in Taiwan, Hung is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of the CPBL.\" Chung Meng-shun (\u937e\u5b5f\u821c) designed every original logo of the four founding teams.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=Po-hsuan|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=Baseball artist\u2019s can-do attitude a hit|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/28/2003631128|accessdate=28 October 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Taiwan Major League===\n{{main|Taiwan Major League}}\n\nIn 1997, the newly founded [[Taiwan Major League]] began to compete with the CPBL. The two leagues were often competing with each other, but eventually, the TML merged with the CPBL.\n\n==Organization==\nAll teams are owned by and named after large Taiwanese corporations, a similar practice seen in Japan's [[NPB]] and South Korea's [[Korea Baseball Organization|KBO]]. Each team manages a regional market with a home city, but does not play its games exclusively in that market. Other than the home cities, regular season games are also held in [[Hsinchu]], [[Douliou Baseball Stadium|Douliou]], [[Chiayi Baseball Field|Chiayi]], [[Pingtung Baseball Field|Pingtung]], [[Luodong]], [[Hualien Baseball Stadium|Hualien]], and [[Taitung City|Taitung]] with less frequency.\n\nEach season spans from March to October, with a one-week all-star break in June or July, which separates the season into first and second half-seasons. Playoffs are held in late October or early November, with three teams competing in two rounds. A team may qualify for playoffs either by winning a half-season title, or be awarded a wild card berth by attaining the highest place in the seasonal ranks. If a team wins a half-season title, it will not be considered in the seasonal ranks when the winner of the wild card is being decided. If both half seasons were won by the same team, another wild card berth will be given through the same mechanism after the first berth has been awarded.\n\nDue to recent reduction in the number of teams, the regulation above may be modified to better apply to the current situation.\n\nSince 2005 the champion team will represent Taiwan in the [[Asia Series]] to compete with other champion teams from [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] ([[Japan Series]]), [[KBO League]] ([[Korean Series]]), [[Australian Baseball League]] ([[Claxton Shield]]), and the [[Confederation of European Baseball]] ([[European Champion Cup Final Four|European Champion Cup]]).\n\n===Foreign players===\nA typical monthly salary for a foreign player is in between 5,000-12,000 [[USD]], these positions are normally filled by AA, AAA, or Japanese minor leaguers. The number of foreign players allowed on a team's roster is limited to four. Of the four players only three are allowed to be activated on the major league roster, the remaining foreign player can practice and prepare with the team or play in the minors. A foreign player, once sent to the minor league team, must wait a week before being allowed to be recalled to the major league.\n\nForeign players, from regions other than Japan and South Korea, are given Chinese [[epithets]] to increase familiarity with Taiwanese fans. These epithets, usually two to three characters in length, are generally loose [[transliterations]] of the players' names and are generally chosen as terms meant to convey strength or might. One example is [[Jeff Andra]], whose epithet is ''Feiyong'' (\u98db\u52c7) \u2014 meaning, literally, a flying brave man. Recently however, most foreign players are just simply given a direct Chinese [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Some players (mostly foreign players) have now adopted the custom in the rest of the world by placing their surnames on the back of their jerseys using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Some teams now have adopted Latin alphabet jerseys, a trend that has picked up in recent years. The [[Fubon Guardians]] only have uniforms with such, and the other teams are adopting such jerseys on occasion.\n\n===Current clubs===\n{{Location map+|Taiwan|float=left|width=350|caption=Location of the member organisations|places=\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions|Lions]]|lat=22.98|long=120.20|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Rakuten Monkeys|Monkeys]]|lat=25.00|long=121.20|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Chinatrust Brothers|Brothers]]|lat=24.2|long=120.68|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Fubon Guardians|Guardians]]|lat=25.095|long=121.5|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Wei Chuan Dragons|Dragons]]|lat=24.70|long=120.9|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n{|class=wikitable\n!Club\n!Chinese Name\n!Location\n!Stadium\n!Capacity\n!Joined\n|-\n|'''[[Chinatrust Brothers]]'''\n|\u4e2d\u4fe1\u5144\u5f1f\n|[[Taichung City]]*\n|[[Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium]]*\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|20,000\n|1990\n|-\n|'''[[Fubon Guardians]]'''\n|\u5bcc\u90a6\u608d\u5c07\n|[[New Taipei City]]\n|[[Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|12,500\n|1993\n|-\n|'''[[Rakuten Monkeys]]'''\n|\u6a02\u5929\u6843\u733f\n|[[Taoyuan City]]\n|[[Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|20,000\n|2004\n|-\n|'''[[Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions]]'''\n|\u7d71\u4e007-ELEVEN\u7345\n|[[Tainan City]]\n|[[Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|12,000\n|1990\n|-\n|'''[[Wei Chuan Dragons]]'''\n|\u5473\u5168\u9f8d\n|[[Hsinchu City]]\n|[[Hsinchu CKS Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|10,000\n|2019\n|-\n|}\n\n<sub>*</sub> Brother Elephants did not reach an agreement with [[Taichung City Government]], but nonetheless play their home games in the regional market.\n\n=== Defunct clubs ===\n* [[China Times Eagles]] (\u6642\u5831\u9df9) (1993\u20131997)\n* [[Chinatrust Whales]] (\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9be8) (1997\u20132008)\n* [[dmedia T-REX]] (\u7c73\u8fea\u4e9e\u66b4\u9f8d) (2003\u20132008)\n* [[Mercuries Tigers]] (\u4e09\u5546\u864e) (1990\u20131999)\n\n===Minor League===\nCPBL Minor League took shape in late 2003 as a result of cooperation with [[Chinese Taipei Baseball Association]]. [[Alternative service]] draftees, players deemed eligible to complete their national service obligation in the field of baseball, were sent to CPBL member organizations to fill their roster. There are currently four minor league teams, each plays about 80 games annually. Similar to [[Nippon Professional Baseball|NPB]]'s minor leagues, the minor league teams are each owned by CPBL member clubs as reserve teams rather than independent organizations.  Starting in 2019, a new minor league club is set to be operated by the [[Australian Baseball League]] as their \"winter ball\" league as an Australian team is set to begin play in the top CPBL league in 2020.\n\n== League Champions ==\n{{Main|Taiwan Series}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=300|Team\n! width=100|Wins\n! width=100|Losses\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Uni-President Lions]]\n| <center>9*</center>\n| <center>6</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Chinatrust Brothers]]\n| <center>7*</center>\n| <center>6</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Rakuten Monkeys]]\n| <center>6</center>\n| <center>2</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Wei Chuan Dragons]]\n| <center>4</center>\n| <center>2</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Fubon Guardians]]\n| <center>3</center>\n| <center>5</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Chinatrust Whales]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>2</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[China Times Eagles]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>1</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[dmedia T-REX|Macoto Cobras]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>1</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Mercuries Tigers]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>1</center>\n|-\n|}\n\n<small>* Taiwan Series was not held in 1992, 1994 and 1995 because Brother Elephants and Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions won the titles by virtue of winning both half-seasons, resulting in no losers in the 3 seasons' Taiwan Series.</small>\n\n* As of the end of the 2017 season.\n\n==All-star game==\n{{main|CPBL All-Star Game}}\n\n==Home Run Derby==\n{{main|CPBL Home Run Derby}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{See also|Baseball awards#Taiwan (Republic of China): Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL)}}\n\n===Most Valuable Player award===\n{{main|List of CPBL MVP of the Year Award|l1=CPBL MVP of the Year Award}}\n\n===Rookie of the Year Award===\n{{main|CPBL Rookie of the Year Award}}\n\n===CPBL Manager of the Year Award===\n\n===CPBL Golden Glove Award===\n\n===Most progress award===\n:''Main article: [[List of CPBL most progressive award|CPBL most progressive award]] (comeback player)''\n\n===Taiwan Series MVP===\n\n===Taiwan Series Outstanding Player===\n\n===CPBL All-Star Game MVP===\n\n===CPBL MVP of the Month===\n\n==Culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[thundersticks|Cheersticks]] are a pair of plastic sticks, often seen at baseball games in Taiwan.

Such scandals have led to decline in attendance and also the disbanding of some teams.\n\n===The August 3 Incident===\nThe first scandal was the \"August 3 Incident\", when a group of weapon-carrying local gang members rushed into a Taichung hotel and threatened five Brother Elephants players, including star pitcher [[Chen Yi-Hsin]] (\u9673\u7fa9\u4fe1), in order for them to cooperate with the gang and fix games for their gambling business on the evening of August 3, 1996. CPBL reported the incident to the police immediately and the gang members were soon arrested, but rumors about game fixing swirled in Taiwan.\n\n===The Black Eagles Incident===<!-- This section is linked from [[China Times Eagles]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nThe rumors came true in January 1997, just before the season started. With solid evidence, police arrested several CPBL players suspected of being in illegal gambling. During the process, many players, mostly from the [[China Times Eagles]], were found to be involved in the game-fixing and were promptly expelled by CPBL. In June 1997, only two Taiwanese players on the roster of the China Times Eagles were not involved in any sort of scandal, and the rest of the league had to lend their players to the Eagles so that they could finish out the season.\n\nThe China Times Eagles were eventually disbanded the next season as a result, and attendance declined sharply, from its peak of 6,000 in 1994 to merely 1,500 in 1998. However, the fiasco did not end there. In August 1997, several [[Mercuries Tigers]] players were threatened by gambling gangs under similar circumstances as the August 3 Incident. In April 1999, the [[Wei Chuan Dragons]]' then manager [[Hsu Sheng-ming]] (\u5f90\u751f\u660e) was attacked near his residence in Taipei. The Mercuries Tigers and the Wei Chuan Dragons were also badly affected by the financial loss brought on by the scandal and were disbanded after the 1999 season. The scandal was later nicknamed \"The Black Eagles Incident\", a reference to the [[Black Sox Scandal]], and also because the China Times Eagles were the most involved in the scandal.\n\n===2005 game-fixing scandal===\nIn July 2005, another gambling-related scandal surfaced when the local <cite>[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]</cite> published a story with photographs of [[Chinatrust Whales]]' Australian pitcher [[Brad Purcell]] at a Taipei lounge bar along with several local gang members. This article also pointed out several games which may have been fixed between May and June 2005, and listed nearly ten players involved, mostly from foreign countries.\n\nLocal prosecutor [[Hsu Wei-Yueh]] (\u5f90\u7dad\u5dbd) took up the case and arrested [[La New Bears]] catcher [[Chen Chao-Ying]] (\u9673\u662d\u7a4e) and [[Macoto Cobras]] coach [[Tsai Sheng-Fong]] (\u8521\u751f\u8c50) on July 27, both of whom were immediately expelled from the league. However, on August 22, Hsu released the two, stating that \"they had made full confessions\". Brad Purcell himself had been released earlier by the Chinatrust Whales (and expelled from the league) and fled Taiwan before any trial could start.\n\nHsu later summoned a total of fifteen players, including [[Sinon Bulls]] American pitcher [[Jeff Andra]], La New Bears Puerto Rican infielder [[Victor Rodriguez (baseball)|Victor Rodriguez]], and Chinatrust Whales Dominican pitcher [[Emiliano Giron]], and claimed that they were involved in gambling. None of the players admitted to being involved in game-fixing but Hsu ruled that the imprisoned players needed bail of NT $100,000 to be released. CPBL immediately expelled the players who were arrested. Only the Brother Elephants and the Uni-President Lions were unaffected by this scandal.\n\nThe circumstances of this scandal remain unclear, with the lack of evidence and confessions, and the fact that Hsu Wei-Yueh himself was later arrested for his involvement in bribery scandals, which led to his trial and sentence in 2005.\n\n===dmedia T-REX scandal===\nOn October 8, 2008, [[Banqiao District|Banqiao]] district attorney's office called the owner of [[dmedia T-REX]] Shih Chien-hsin, the team's GM, spokesperson, one coach, and three players to the office for allegedly being involved in game-fixing. The three players, [[Chen Yuen-chia]] (\u9673\u5143\u7532), [[Chen Ke-fan]] (\u9673\u514b\u5e06), and [[Cory Bailey]], were later released after posting bail. In accordance with CPBL policy, the three were immediately expelled and they were banned from playing professionally in the league. Due to the involvement of management/operation personnel in the scandal, the team was expelled from CPBL on October 23, 2008.\n\nThe Chinatrust Whales also announced their disbandment on November 11, after playing twelve years in the CPBL. The league now only has 4 teams.\n\n===2009 game-fixing scandal===\nThe day after the final game of the [[2009 Taiwan Series]] authorities raided the Brother Elephants' dormitory in Taipei and ordered several players to report to the prosecutors' office for questioning regarding game-fixing allegations. In the following weeks, multiple players from the Brother Elephants, Sinon Bulls, and La New Bears were questioned, and some of them were arrested and eventually charged. Furthermore, Elephants manager [[Shin Nakagomi]] was also charged and later pled guilty in exchange for being released and allowed to return to Japan. Some of the convicted players were given prison sentences ranging from one to four years.\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2014}}The CPBL has long been criticized for lacking protection of players' rights, and players do not have a union like the MLB, NPB, and KBO. Players are often given one-year contracts that sometimes include terms that favor team management. Unrestricted [[free agent|free agency]] does not exist in the CPBL, as the CPBL fears that teams with lower payrolls could be overtaken by high-payroll teams. If a player wishes to sign with another team for any reason, then he must get the consent of the team he was playing with before. The player's team may counteroffer. That does not apply to a player seeking to sign with a team in another country.\n\nThe CPBL is governed by a ''General Managers' Council'', which means the members of the council are the respective [[General manager (baseball)|general managers]] of each team.

The league was established in 1989.<ref>[http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp Intro of CPBL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316075320/http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp |date=2009-03-16 }}</ref> CPBL eventually absorbed the competing [[Taiwan Major League]] in 2003. As of the 2020 season, the CPBL consists of five teams.\n\n==History==\nBaseball was first introduced to Taiwan during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], and gained popularity when the national little league baseball teams won numerous [[Little League World Series]] championships in the 1970s and 1980s. The [[Taiwan National Baseball Team|national baseball team]] also performed exceptionally well in many international competitions. However, the development of baseball in Taiwan was limited due to the lack of a professional league, and therefore many players were reluctant to commit to the sport.\n\nThe idea of forming a professional baseball league in Taiwan was first suggested by local [[Brother Elephants|Brother Hotel]]'s chairman Hung Teng-Sheng (\u6d2a\u9a30\u52dd). He formed his amateur Brother Hotel baseball team in 1984, and intended to professionalize his team and form a professional league within a few years. Throughout 1988 and 1989, Hung visited numerous Taiwanese businesses, trying to convince them to form professional baseball clubs. Most of his requests were rejected, but [[Wei Chuan Dragons|Wei Chuan Corporation]], [[Mercuries Tigers|Mercuries Chain Stores]], and [[Uni-President Corporation]] all supported the idea and formed teams. The Chinese Professional Baseball League was established on October 23, 1989, with Hung Teng-sheng acting as secretary-general. Because of his contribution to professional baseball in Taiwan, Hung is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of the CPBL.\" Chung Meng-shun (\u937e\u5b5f\u821c) designed every original logo of the four founding teams.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=Po-hsuan|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=Baseball artist\u2019s can-do attitude a hit|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/28/2003631128|accessdate=28 October 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Taiwan Major League===\n{{main|Taiwan Major League}}\n\nIn 1997, the newly founded [[Taiwan Major League]] began to compete with the CPBL. The two leagues were often competing with each other, but eventually, the TML merged with the CPBL.\n\n==Organization==\nAll teams are owned by and named after large Taiwanese corporations, a similar practice seen in Japan's [[NPB]] and South Korea's [[Korea Baseball Organization|KBO]]. Each team manages a regional market with a home city, but does not play its games exclusively in that market. Other than the home cities, regular season games are also held in [[Hsinchu]], [[Douliou Baseball Stadium|Douliou]], [[Chiayi Baseball Field|Chiayi]], [[Pingtung Baseball Field|Pingtung]], [[Luodong]], [[Hualien Baseball Stadium|Hualien]], and [[Taitung City|Taitung]] with less frequency.\n\nEach season spans from March to October, with a one-week all-star break in June or July, which separates the season into first and second half-seasons. Playoffs are held in late October or early November, with three teams competing in two rounds. A team may qualify for playoffs either by winning a half-season title, or be awarded a wild card berth by attaining the highest place in the seasonal ranks. If a team wins a half-season title, it will not be considered in the seasonal ranks when the winner of the wild card is being decided. If both half seasons were won by the same team, another wild card berth will be given through the same mechanism after the first berth has been awarded.\n\nDue to recent reduction in the number of teams, the regulation above may be modified to better apply to the current situation.\n\nSince 2005 the champion team will represent Taiwan in the [[Asia Series]] to compete with other champion teams from [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] ([[Japan Series]]), [[KBO League]] ([[Korean Series]]), [[Australian Baseball League]] ([[Claxton Shield]]), and the [[Confederation of European Baseball]] ([[European Champion Cup Final Four|European Champion Cup]]).\n\n===Foreign players===\nA typical monthly salary for a foreign player is in between 5,000-12,000 [[USD]], these positions are normally filled by AA, AAA, or Japanese minor leaguers. The number of foreign players allowed on a team's roster is limited to four. Of the four players only three are allowed to be activated on the major league roster, the remaining foreign player can practice and prepare with the team or play in the minors. A foreign player, once sent to the minor league team, must wait a week before being allowed to be recalled to the major league.\n\nForeign players, from regions other than Japan and South Korea, are given Chinese [[epithets]] to increase familiarity with Taiwanese fans. These epithets, usually two to three characters in length, are generally loose [[transliterations]] of the players' names and are generally chosen as terms meant to convey strength or might. One example is [[Jeff Andra]], whose epithet is ''Feiyong'' (\u98db\u52c7) \u2014 meaning, literally, a flying brave man. Recently however, most foreign players are just simply given a direct Chinese [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Some players (mostly foreign players) have now adopted the custom in the rest of the world by placing their surnames on the back of their jerseys using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Some teams now have adopted Latin alphabet jerseys, a trend that has picked up in recent years. The [[Fubon Guardians]] only have uniforms with such, and the other teams are adopting such jerseys on occasion.\n\n===Current clubs===\n{{Location map+|Taiwan|float=left|width=350|caption=Location of the member organisations|places=\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions|Lions]]|lat=22.98|long=120.20|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Rakuten Monkeys|Monkeys]]|lat=25.00|long=121.20|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Chinatrust Brothers|Brothers]]|lat=24.2|long=120.68|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Fubon Guardians|Guardians]]|lat=25.095|long=121.5|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Taiwan|label=[[Wei Chuan Dragons|Dragons]]|lat=24.70|long=120.9|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n{|class=wikitable\n!Club\n!Chinese Name\n!Location\n!Stadium\n!Capacity\n!Joined\n|-\n|'''[[Chinatrust Brothers]]'''\n|\u4e2d\u4fe1\u5144\u5f1f\n|[[Taichung City]]*\n|[[Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium]]*\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|20,000\n|1990\n|-\n|'''[[Fubon Guardians]]'''\n|\u5bcc\u90a6\u608d\u5c07\n|[[New Taipei City]]\n|[[Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|12,500\n|1993\n|-\n|'''[[Rakuten Monkeys]]'''\n|\u6a02\u5929\u6843\u733f\n|[[Taoyuan City]]\n|[[Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|20,000\n|2004\n|-\n|'''[[Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions]]'''\n|\u7d71\u4e007-ELEVEN\u7345\n|[[Tainan City]]\n|[[Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|12,000\n|1990\n|-\n|'''[[Wei Chuan Dragons]]'''\n|\u5473\u5168\u9f8d\n|[[Hsinchu City]]\n|[[Hsinchu CKS Baseball Stadium]]\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|10,000\n|2019\n|-\n|}\n\n<sub>*</sub> Brother Elephants did not reach an agreement with [[Taichung City Government]], but nonetheless play their home games in the regional market.\n\n=== Defunct clubs ===\n* [[China Times Eagles]] (\u6642\u5831\u9df9) (1993\u20131997)\n* [[Chinatrust Whales]] (\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9be8) (1997\u20132008)\n* [[dmedia T-REX]] (\u7c73\u8fea\u4e9e\u66b4\u9f8d) (2003\u20132008)\n* [[Mercuries Tigers]] (\u4e09\u5546\u864e) (1990\u20131999)\n\n===Minor League===\nCPBL Minor League took shape in late 2003 as a result of cooperation with [[Chinese Taipei Baseball Association]]. [[Alternative service]] draftees, players deemed eligible to complete their national service obligation in the field of baseball, were sent to CPBL member organizations to fill their roster. There are currently four minor league teams, each plays about 80 games annually. Similar to [[Nippon Professional Baseball|NPB]]'s minor leagues, the minor league teams are each owned by CPBL member clubs as reserve teams rather than independent organizations.  Starting in 2019, a new minor league club is set to be operated by the [[Australian Baseball League]] as their \"winter ball\" league as an Australian team is set to begin play in the top CPBL league in 2020.\n\n== League Champions ==\n{{Main|Taiwan Series}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=300|Team\n! width=100|Wins\n! width=100|Losses\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Uni-President Lions]]\n| <center>9*</center>\n| <center>6</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Chinatrust Brothers]]\n| <center>7*</center>\n| <center>6</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Rakuten Monkeys]]\n| <center>6</center>\n| <center>2</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Wei Chuan Dragons]]\n| <center>4</center>\n| <center>2</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Fubon Guardians]]\n| <center>3</center>\n| <center>5</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Chinatrust Whales]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>2</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[China Times Eagles]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>1</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[dmedia T-REX|Macoto Cobras]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>1</center>\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|[[Mercuries Tigers]]<small> (defunct)</small>\n| <center>0</center>\n| <center>1</center>\n|-\n|}\n\n<small>* Taiwan Series was not held in 1992, 1994 and 1995 because Brother Elephants and Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions won the titles by virtue of winning both half-seasons, resulting in no losers in the 3 seasons' Taiwan Series.</small>\n\n* As of the end of the 2017 season.\n\n==All-star game==\n{{main|CPBL All-Star Game}}\n\n==Home Run Derby==\n{{main|CPBL Home Run Derby}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{See also|Baseball awards#Taiwan (Republic of China): Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL)}}\n\n===Most Valuable Player award===\n{{main|List of CPBL MVP of the Year Award|l1=CPBL MVP of the Year Award}}\n\n===Rookie of the Year Award===\n{{main|CPBL Rookie of the Year Award}}\n\n===CPBL Manager of the Year Award===\n\n===CPBL Golden Glove Award===\n\n===Most progress award===\n:''Main article: [[List of CPBL most progressive award|CPBL most progressive award]] (comeback player)''\n\n===Taiwan Series MVP===\n\n===Taiwan Series Outstanding Player===\n\n===CPBL All-Star Game MVP===\n\n===CPBL MVP of the Month===\n\n==Culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[thundersticks|Cheersticks]] are a pair of plastic sticks, often seen at baseball games in Taiwan.

Such scandals have led to decline in attendance and also the disbanding of some teams.\n\n===The August 3 Incident===\nThe first scandal was the \"August 3 Incident\", when a group of weapon-carrying local gang members rushed into a Taichung hotel and threatened five Brother Elephants players, including star pitcher [[Chen Yi-Hsin]] (\u9673\u7fa9\u4fe1), in order for them to cooperate with the gang and fix games for their gambling business on the evening of August 3, 1996. CPBL reported the incident to the police immediately and the gang members were soon arrested, but rumors about game fixing swirled in Taiwan.\n\n===The Black Eagles Incident===<!-- This section is linked from [[China Times Eagles]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nThe rumors came true in January 1997, just before the season started. With solid evidence, police arrested several CPBL players suspected of being in illegal gambling. During the process, many players, mostly from the [[China Times Eagles]], were found to be involved in the game-fixing and were promptly expelled by CPBL. In June 1997, only two Taiwanese players on the roster of the China Times Eagles were not involved in any sort of scandal, and the rest of the league had to lend their players to the Eagles so that they could finish out the season.\n\nThe China Times Eagles were eventually disbanded the next season as a result, and attendance declined sharply, from its peak of 6,000 in 1994 to merely 1,500 in 1998. However, the fiasco did not end there. In August 1997, several [[Mercuries Tigers]] players were threatened by gambling gangs under similar circumstances as the August 3 Incident. In April 1999, the [[Wei Chuan Dragons]]' then manager [[Hsu Sheng-ming]] (\u5f90\u751f\u660e) was attacked near his residence in Taipei. The Mercuries Tigers and the Wei Chuan Dragons were also badly affected by the financial loss brought on by the scandal and were disbanded after the 1999 season. The scandal was later nicknamed \"The Black Eagles Incident\", a reference to the [[Black Sox Scandal]], and also because the China Times Eagles were the most involved in the scandal.\n\n===2005 game-fixing scandal===\nIn July 2005, another gambling-related scandal surfaced when the local <cite>[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]</cite> published a story with photographs of [[Chinatrust Whales]]' Australian pitcher [[Brad Purcell]] at a Taipei lounge bar along with several local gang members. This article also pointed out several games which may have been fixed between May and June 2005, and listed nearly ten players involved, mostly from foreign countries.\n\nLocal prosecutor [[Hsu Wei-Yueh]] (\u5f90\u7dad\u5dbd) took up the case and arrested [[La New Bears]] catcher [[Chen Chao-Ying]] (\u9673\u662d\u7a4e) and [[Macoto Cobras]] coach [[Tsai Sheng-Fong]] (\u8521\u751f\u8c50) on July 27, both of whom were immediately expelled from the league. However, on August 22, Hsu released the two, stating that \"they had made full confessions\". Brad Purcell himself had been released earlier by the Chinatrust Whales (and expelled from the league) and fled Taiwan before any trial could start.\n\nHsu later summoned a total of fifteen players, including [[Sinon Bulls]] American pitcher [[Jeff Andra]], La New Bears Puerto Rican infielder [[Victor Rodriguez (baseball)|Victor Rodriguez]], and Chinatrust Whales Dominican pitcher [[Emiliano Giron]], and claimed that they were involved in gambling. None of the players admitted to being involved in game-fixing but Hsu ruled that the imprisoned players needed bail of NT $100,000 to be released. CPBL immediately expelled the players who were arrested. Only the Brother Elephants and the Uni-President Lions were unaffected by this scandal.\n\nThe circumstances of this scandal remain unclear, with the lack of evidence and confessions, and the fact that Hsu Wei-Yueh himself was later arrested for his involvement in bribery scandals, which led to his trial and sentence in 2005.\n\n===dmedia T-REX scandal===\nOn October 8, 2008, [[Banqiao District|Banqiao]] district attorney's office called the owner of [[dmedia T-REX]] Shih Chien-hsin, the team's GM, spokesperson, one coach, and three players to the office for allegedly being involved in game-fixing. The three players, [[Chen Yuen-chia]] (\u9673\u5143\u7532), [[Chen Ke-fan]] (\u9673\u514b\u5e06), and [[Cory Bailey]], were later released after posting bail. In accordance with CPBL policy, the three were immediately expelled and they were banned from playing professionally in the league. Due to the involvement of management/operation personnel in the scandal, the team was expelled from CPBL on October 23, 2008.\n\nThe Chinatrust Whales also announced their disbandment on November 11, after playing twelve years in the CPBL. The league now only has 4 teams.\n\n===2009 game-fixing scandal===\nThe day after the final game of the [[2009 Taiwan Series]] authorities raided the Brother Elephants' dormitory in Taipei and ordered several players to report to the prosecutors' office for questioning regarding game-fixing allegations. In the following weeks, multiple players from the Brother Elephants, Sinon Bulls, and La New Bears were questioned, and some of them were arrested and eventually charged. Furthermore, Elephants manager [[Shin Nakagomi]] was also charged and later pled guilty in exchange for being released and allowed to return to Japan. Some of the convicted players were given prison sentences ranging from one to four years.\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2014}}The CPBL has long been criticized for lacking protection of players' rights, and players do not have a union like the MLB, NPB, and KBO. Players are often given one-year contracts that sometimes include terms that favor team management. Unrestricted [[free agent|free agency]] does not exist in the CPBL, as the CPBL fears that teams with lower payrolls could be overtaken by high-payroll teams. If a player wishes to sign with another team for any reason, then he must get the consent of the team he was playing with before. The player's team may counteroffer. That does not apply to a player seeking to sign with a team in another country.\n\nThe CPBL is governed by a ''General Managers' Council'', which means the members of the council are the respective [[General manager (baseball)|general managers]] of each team. This is unlike any other professional baseball league around the world, where the governing body usually consists of a committee of selected individuals unaffiliated with any other franchise. The CPBL governing structure effectively renders the league powerless in regulation and enforcement of many policies, as GMs can easily veto any major resolutions. Since major reform would require an unanimous approval of the council, it is difficult to initiate major reforms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Asia Series]]\n*[[Taiwan baseball team]]\n*[[Professional baseball in Taiwan]]\n*[[Baseball awards#Taiwan (Republic of China)]]\n*[[List of nicknames used in CPBL]]\n*[[Gambling in Taiwan]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cpbl.com.tw Chinese Professional Baseball League (in Chinese)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090316075320/http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp History of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (in English)]\n\n{{CPBL}}\n{{Professional Baseball}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball leagues in Asia|Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Baseball in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Chinese Professional Baseball League| ]]\n[[Category:Sports leagues established in 1989]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Taiwan]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCriticisms:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: an unanimous \u2192 a unanimous", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Professional_Baseball_League"}

It won nine [[Tony Award]]s and the 1976 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].

The Owls compete in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the East Division of [[Conference USA]] (CUSA). The Owls' head coach is [[Willie Taggart]], who was previously the head coach of [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State University]]. Florida Atlantic has produced a Sun Belt Conference co-championship team in 2007, two Conference USA championships in 2017 and 2019, along with 3 postseason bowl appearances and one appearance in the [[2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season#NCAA Division I-AA Playoff bracket|2003 I-AA Playoffs]]. The Owls play their home games at [[FAU Stadium]] which has a [[seating capacity]] of 29,419.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Florida Atlantic Owls football seasons}}\n\n===Howard Schnellenberger era (2001\u20132011)===\nFlorida Atlantic University football began play in 2001 with legendary coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] serving as [[head coach]] until 2011. Schnellenberger was a former offensive coordinator with the [[National Football League|NFL]]{{'}}s [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] who, as a head coach, turned around a moribund [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] football program and won a national championship in his fifth season in 1983 after back to back nine win seasons in 1980 and 1981. Schnellenberger also turned around a downtrodden [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] football program, winning the Fiesta Bowl in 1990.\n\n[[File:Howard Schnellenberger Carrfour.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Coach Schnellenberger (blue jacket)]]\nAfter competing their first four years as an [[NCAA Division I-AA|NCAA Division I-AA independent]], the Owls moved to [[Division I-A]] and the [[Sun Belt Conference]]. Starting with [[2010\u201313 Conference USA realignment|the 2013\u201314 school year]], FAU athletics have competed in [[Conference USA]].\n\nIn [[1998 in sports|1998]], Florida Atlantic University announced it was pursuing the creation of an [[NCAA]] [[college football|football]] program and that [[Howard Schnellenberger]] was going to lead the charge, as director of football operations and head coach. After his success in rebuilding programs at Miami and Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger now undertook the role of building a program from scratch. Much like his time at Miami and Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger did not shy from placing lofty expectations and high goals on his newly created program. Even before FAU would play an intercollegiate game, Coach Schnellenberger explained the goal of FAU football would be to play the best teams it can schedule, in order for the program to aim for a national championship in Division I-A football. These extreme goals were not unusual from a man like Coach Schnellenberger.  At Louisville, facing threats from the administration that the football team would be terminated, Schnellenberger made the bold (and now famous) prediction, \"[We are] on a collision course with the national championship.  The only variable is time.\u201d<ref>http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=6488</ref>\n\nOn August 29, 2000, the first practice was held at the [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] campus of FAU, and 164 students showed up to try out for the team.  During the August 29, 2000 first practice, dubbed the inaugural scrimmage game, FAU continued the tradition of Homecoming King, this time including the crowning ceremony of the King as part of the halftime festivities.  The Homecoming King crown was bestowed upon Wayne Burns, having been voted in by the majority of student population from across all the campuses at the time, which totaled five, then running a Q&A gauntlet alongside the top three candidates, conducted by a committee of students and faculty, who then voted to determine if Mr. Burns would move to the winners circle or if the next candidate would get the crown.  Mr. Burns was driven around the scrimmage game field in a convertible Rolls Royce to wave to the 164 students in the stands, many of whom voted for him.  Wayne Burns was and is the oldest Homecoming King to ever receive the honor at FAU. Florida Atlantic joined NCAA Division I-AA, now known as [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]], as an independent team for the 2001 season.  Its first-ever intercollegiate competition was against [[Slippery Rock University]], which the Owls lost 40\u20137 in front of 25,632 fans at Joe Robbie Stadium, now known as [[Hard Rock Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fausports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/090201aaa.html|title=FAU vs Slippery Rock|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe team finished its inaugural season at 4\u20136 and followed the next season at 2\u20139.  Major accomplishments in its first two seasons include the program's first win, which came in its second game, against [[Bethune\u2013Cookman Wildcats football|Bethune\u2013Cookman]], 31\u201328, and won in the first meeting with newly created [[South Florida]] [[sports rivalry|rival]], [[FIU Panthers football|Florida International University]], 31\u201321.\n\nOn September 15, 2007 FAU defeated its first [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opponent with a 42\u201339 victory over [[2007 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/scoreboards/2007/09/15/35933_viewcast_recap.html |title= FAU vs. Minnesota |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604123525/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/scoreboards/2007/09/15/35933_viewcast_recap.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}</ref> Led by [[Rusty Smith (American football)|Rusty Smith]], FAU beat [[2007 Troy Trojans football team|Troy]] in the final game of the 2007 season to become Sun Belt Conference champions and received an invitation to the [[2007 New Orleans Bowl]], its first ever bowl bid.

They were surpassed only by the undefeated [[1958 Air Force Falcons football team|1958 Air Force Falcons]], who had played just one year of Division 1 football before being invited to the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], where they played to a scoreless tie against the [[1958 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU Horned Frogs]] on [[1959 Cotton Bowl Classic|January 1, 1959]].\n\nOn August 11, 2011, Howard Schnellenberger announced he would retire at the end of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fausports.com/news/2011/8/11/Schnellenberger_to_Retire_as_Football_Coach.aspx|title=Schnellenberger to Retire as Football Coach|website=Florida Atlantic University Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The Owls ended the 2011 season 1\u201311, with the only victory coming from a 38\u201335 home win over UAB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fausports.com/sports/football/schedule/2011|title=2011 Football Schedule|website=Florida Atlantic University Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n===Carl Pelini era (2012\u20132013)===\nOn December 1, 2011 FAU hired [[Carl Pelini]], the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] defensive coordinator to become their new head coach, to succeed Schnellenberger.\n\nOn October 30, 2013, Pelini resigned from his position after admitting to school officials he was using illegal drugs, specifically [[marijuana]] and [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/fau-now-says-carl-pelini-has-been-fired-with-cause/|title=FAU now says Carl Pelini has been fired with cause|publisher=}}</ref> He, along with defensive coordinator Pete Rekstis, officially stepped down from their positions only three days before the school's homecoming game, which they won 34\u201317 under interim head coach [[Brian Wright (American football)|Brian Wright]].

The Owls compete in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the East Division of [[Conference USA]] (CUSA). The Owls' head coach is [[Willie Taggart]], who was previously the head coach of [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State University]]. Florida Atlantic has produced a Sun Belt Conference co-championship team in 2007, two Conference USA championships in 2017 and 2019, along with 3 postseason bowl appearances and one appearance in the [[2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season#NCAA Division I-AA Playoff bracket|2003 I-AA Playoffs]]. The Owls play their home games at [[FAU Stadium]] which has a [[seating capacity]] of 29,419.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Florida Atlantic Owls football seasons}}\n\n===Howard Schnellenberger era (2001\u20132011)===\nFlorida Atlantic University football began play in 2001 with legendary coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] serving as [[head coach]] until 2011. Schnellenberger was a former offensive coordinator with the [[National Football League|NFL]]{{'}}s [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] who, as a head coach, turned around a moribund [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] football program and won a national championship in his fifth season in 1983 after back to back nine win seasons in 1980 and 1981. Schnellenberger also turned around a downtrodden [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] football program, winning the Fiesta Bowl in 1990.\n\n[[File:Howard Schnellenberger Carrfour.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Coach Schnellenberger (blue jacket)]]\nAfter competing their first four years as an [[NCAA Division I-AA|NCAA Division I-AA independent]], the Owls moved to [[Division I-A]] and the [[Sun Belt Conference]]. Starting with [[2010\u201313 Conference USA realignment|the 2013\u201314 school year]], FAU athletics have competed in [[Conference USA]].\n\nIn [[1998 in sports|1998]], Florida Atlantic University announced it was pursuing the creation of an [[NCAA]] [[college football|football]] program and that [[Howard Schnellenberger]] was going to lead the charge, as director of football operations and head coach. After his success in rebuilding programs at Miami and Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger now undertook the role of building a program from scratch. Much like his time at Miami and Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger did not shy from placing lofty expectations and high goals on his newly created program. Even before FAU would play an intercollegiate game, Coach Schnellenberger explained the goal of FAU football would be to play the best teams it can schedule, in order for the program to aim for a national championship in Division I-A football. These extreme goals were not unusual from a man like Coach Schnellenberger.  At Louisville, facing threats from the administration that the football team would be terminated, Schnellenberger made the bold (and now famous) prediction, \"[We are] on a collision course with the national championship.  The only variable is time.\u201d<ref>http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=6488</ref>\n\nOn August 29, 2000, the first practice was held at the [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] campus of FAU, and 164 students showed up to try out for the team.  During the August 29, 2000 first practice, dubbed the inaugural scrimmage game, FAU continued the tradition of Homecoming King, this time including the crowning ceremony of the King as part of the halftime festivities.  The Homecoming King crown was bestowed upon Wayne Burns, having been voted in by the majority of student population from across all the campuses at the time, which totaled five, then running a Q&A gauntlet alongside the top three candidates, conducted by a committee of students and faculty, who then voted to determine if Mr. Burns would move to the winners circle or if the next candidate would get the crown.  Mr. Burns was driven around the scrimmage game field in a convertible Rolls Royce to wave to the 164 students in the stands, many of whom voted for him.  Wayne Burns was and is the oldest Homecoming King to ever receive the honor at FAU. Florida Atlantic joined NCAA Division I-AA, now known as [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]], as an independent team for the 2001 season.  Its first-ever intercollegiate competition was against [[Slippery Rock University]], which the Owls lost 40\u20137 in front of 25,632 fans at Joe Robbie Stadium, now known as [[Hard Rock Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fausports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/090201aaa.html|title=FAU vs Slippery Rock|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe team finished its inaugural season at 4\u20136 and followed the next season at 2\u20139.  Major accomplishments in its first two seasons include the program's first win, which came in its second game, against [[Bethune\u2013Cookman Wildcats football|Bethune\u2013Cookman]], 31\u201328, and won in the first meeting with newly created [[South Florida]] [[sports rivalry|rival]], [[FIU Panthers football|Florida International University]], 31\u201321.\n\nOn September 15, 2007 FAU defeated its first [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opponent with a 42\u201339 victory over [[2007 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/scoreboards/2007/09/15/35933_viewcast_recap.html |title= FAU vs. Minnesota |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604123525/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/scoreboards/2007/09/15/35933_viewcast_recap.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}</ref> Led by [[Rusty Smith (American football)|Rusty Smith]], FAU beat [[2007 Troy Trojans football team|Troy]] in the final game of the 2007 season to become Sun Belt Conference champions and received an invitation to the [[2007 New Orleans Bowl]], its first ever bowl bid.

''Influenza'' (2004) is a 30-minute work acted out entirely in front of real [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras stationed throughout Seoul. The film, which charts a desperate man's turn to violent crime over the space of five years, was commissioned by the [[Jeonju International Film Festival]], together with works by Japanese director Sogo Ishii and Hong Kong-based [[Yu Lik-wai]].

He received a partial screenplay credit on the [[anthology film]] ''Seven Reasons Why Beer is Better Than a Lover'' (1996); both screenplay and assistant director credits on Park Ki-yong's debut ''Motel Cactus'' (1997); and is one of four writers (along with [[Jang Joon-hwan]]) credited for the screenplay of ''Phantom: The Submarine'' (1999).<ref name=\"page\" />\n\n===Early directing work===\nShortly afterwards, Bong began shooting his first feature ''[[Barking Dogs Never Bite]]'' (2000) under producer Cha Seung-jae, who had overseen the production of both ''Motel Cactus'' and ''Phantom: The Submarine''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bong Joon Ho: Writing New Chapter in Korean Film History |url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/Archives/index.html?sec=people&No=5391|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130219001116/http://english.kbs.co.kr/Archives/index.html?sec=people&No=5391|url-status=dead|archivedate=February 19, 2013 |publisher=[[Korean Broadcasting System]] |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |date=November 15, 2006}}</ref> The film, about a low-ranking university lecturer who abducts a neighbor's dog, was shot in the same apartment complex where Bong had lived after his marriage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Paquet |first=Darcy |title=Barking Dogs Never Bite |url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html#dogs |publisher=Koreanfilm.org |accessdate=October 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003015832/http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html#dogs|archivedate=October 3, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time of its release in February 2000, it received little commercial interest but some positive critical reviews.

Although passed over by the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Venice Film Festival]], the film eventually received its international premiere, again at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, where it picked up three awards including Best Director. The film also received an unusually strong critical reception on its release in foreign territories, such as France and the U.S.<ref name=\"page\" />\n\n[[File:Bong Joon-Ho at 2010 Independent Spirit Awards.jpg|thumb|Bong at the [[25th Independent Spirit Awards]] on March 5, 2010]]\n\nFollowing this, Bong took some time to contribute short films to two anthology film projects. ''Influenza'' (2004) is a 30-minute work acted out entirely in front of real [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras stationed throughout Seoul. The film, which charts a desperate man's turn to violent crime over the space of five years, was commissioned by the [[Jeonju International Film Festival]], together with works by Japanese director Sogo Ishii and Hong Kong-based [[Yu Lik-wai]]. ''Twentidentity'', meanwhile, is a 20-part anthology film made by alumni of the Korean Academy of Film Arts, on the occasion of the school's 20th anniversary.

After rushing to meet deadlines, the film received a rapturous premiere in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]. Although local audiences were slightly more critical of ''The Host'' than attendees at Cannes, the film was nonetheless a major summer hit. With theater owners calling for more and more prints, the film enjoyed South Korea's widest release ever (on over a third of the nation's 1,800 screens) and set a new [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea|box office record]] with 13 million tickets sold.

Harris also said that \"if I was doing a scene and it was a couple of pages long, he would never shoot the whole thing one way. He'd shoot a few lines, like the first beat of the scene, and then he would turn the camera around and get my part for that part of the scene. Then he would change the angle a little bit\". He additionally noted that \"the editor was sitting right there on the stage, right below the set with a big tent, actually getting the footage as they were filming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/ed-harris-snowpiercer-interview/ |title=Ed Harris Talks SNOWPIERCER, Joining the Film, Being a Fan of Bong Joon Ho and His Unusual Shooting Style, Editing While Shooting, and Working with Chris Evans |last=Radish |first=Christina |date=June 25, 2014 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref> Fellow actor [[Daniel Henshall]] echoed Harris' sentiment calling Bong \"precise\" and \"very sure of what he wants\".
