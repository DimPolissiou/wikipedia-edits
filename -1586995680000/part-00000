According to Limited Atonement, Christ died for the sins of the elect alone, and no atonement was provided for the reprobate.<ref name=\"dort\" /> This is in contrast to a belief that God's [[prevenient grace]] (or \"enabling grace\") enables all to respond to the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|2:21|9}}</sup> so that it is each person's decision and response to God's grace that determines whether Christ's atonement will be effective to that individual.\n\n==History==\n\nThe elements of the doctrine to be known as limited atonement were held by [[Gottschalk of Orbais]] (c. 808 \u2013 c. 867), [[Thomas Bradwardine]]  (c. 1290 \u2013 1349), and [[Gregory of Rimini]] (c. 1300 \u2013 1358), though there was less precision regarding the extent of the atonement before the Reformation period.<ref>{{cite web |last = Clark |first = R.

One of the issues involved had to do with the reason for the limitation of the [[efficacy]] of Christ's satisfaction for sin (roughly, [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]]). Both sides of the controversy agreed that this efficacy was limited to the elect. The disagreement had to do with the grounds for this limitation. For Arminius, the ground was the free choice of people to believe, foreknown by God, with God [[predestination|predestining]] people based on this foreseen faith. For the opponents of Arminius, whose views are represented in the [[Canons of Dort]], this efficacy was limited based on God's predestination, without any foreknowledge of human choice.<ref>{{cite book|title=Calvin and the Reformed Tradition|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2012|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|page=52|edition=Ebook|authorlink=Richard A.

Muller (theologian)}}</ref>.\n\nThe doctrine of limited atonement also includes the claim that the purpose for which Jesus gave his life was limited to the elect - the ''atonement'' is ''limited'' in its purpose.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sproul |first1=R.C. |title=TULIP and Reformed Theology: Limited Atonement |url=https://www.ligonier.org/blog/tulip-and-reformed-theology-limited-atonement/ |website=Ligonier Ministries |accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref>. For this reason, the so-called [[History_of_the_Calvinist-Arminian_debate#Four-point_Calvinists|\"four-point Calvinists\"]], such as the 17th century English Puritan [[Richard Baxter]], reject the doctrine of limited atonement and instead believe that the atonement is available to all who will believe in Christ. They also argue that it was never endorsed by Calvin or the Synod of Dort. They refer to both Calvin's claim that \"It is also a fact, without controversy, that Christ came to atone for the sins 'of the whole world'\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Calvin |first1=John |title=Concerning the Eternal Predestination of God |date=1552 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press}}</ref> and to Article 3 of the Second Main Point of Doctrine of the Synod of Dort which states that \"This death of God's Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world.\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Canons of Dort |url=https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/canons-dort#3550 |website=Christian Reformed Church |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Others, however, claim that Calvin and the Canons of Dort are somewhat vague on this issue<ref name=\"Muller 2012 53\"/> and accept the claim of limited atonement that the efficacy of his death was limited both in purpose and scope to the elect, though they believe his death was sufficient payment for the sin of the whole world. \n\nWith regard to the limited purpose or intent of the atonement to save only the elect, another argument was put forth later in the 17th century. [[Moses Amyraut]] and several others ([[Amyraldist]]s) proposed a system called [[hypothetical universalism]], which taught that in God's decree for Christ to be a sufficient atonement for all sin, his intention was to save all on condition that they believe. This decree was prior to his decree to elect some people for whom the atonement was to be efficacious, and so the efficacy of the atonement was still limited to the elect. Most of the Reformed rejected this view because it envisioned a decree of God (the conditional decree to save all) that was intentionally not realized.<ref>{{cite book|title=After Calvin|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2003|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]{{subscription required}}|p=14&ndash;15|authorlink=Richard A. Muller (theologian)|url=https://www.questia.com/read/105180022/after-calvin-studies-in-the-development-of-a-theological}}</ref>\n\n== Theology ==\n\nThe doctrine of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the doctrine of the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. It also has much to do with the general [[predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist view of predestination]]. Calvinists advocate the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]], which developed in the writings of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as [[penal substitution]], states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the [[sin]]s of men&mdash;that is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men{{Bibleref2c|2Cor|5:21|KJV}}{{Bibleref2c|Rom|8:3b|KJV}}.\n\nThe doctrine of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ has taken the penalty of the elect - that Jesus died for those who would believe, so that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.\n\nThe Calvinist view of [[predestination]] teaches that God created Adam in a state of original righteousness, but he fell into sin and all humanity in him as their [[Covenant theology|federal head]]. Those elected to salvation were chosen without a view to their faith or good works but by the sovereign will of God.\n\nThe Calvinist atonement is called ''definite'' by some because they believe it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called ''limited'' in its extent because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, which is to say that no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic [[Particular Baptists|(Particular) Baptists]], the doctrine was usually known as ''particular redemption'', giving its adherents the name [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]]. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in ''general'' as [[General Baptist]]s believe.\n\n=== Biblical passages ===\n\nThe classic [[Bible]] passage cited to prove a limited extent to the atonement is {{Bibleref2|John|10|ESV}} in which Jesus uses [[shepherd]]ing practices as a [[metaphor]] for his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.{{Bibleref2c|Jn|10:1-5|ESV}}. In that context, Jesus says, \"I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life ''for the sheep,''\"{{Bibleref2c|John|10:14-15|ESV}} and he tells the [[Pharisee]]s that they \"do not believe because [they] are not part of [his] flock.\"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|10:26|ESV}} He continues, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.\" {{Bibleref2c-nb|Jn|10:27f|ESV}} Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand {{Bibleref2|John|10|ESV}} to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way:\n\n# Jesus lays down his life for the sheep.{{Bibleref2c|John|10:14-15|ESV}}\n# Jesus will lose none of his sheep.{{Bibleref2c|John|10:28|ESV}}\n# Many people will not receive eternal life.{{Bibleref2c|Mat|7:13-14|ESV}}\n:Therefore, the Calvinist position is that Jesus did not die for everyone, but only for those whom the Father purposed to save.\n\nAdditionally, in the high priestly prayer, Jesus prays for the protection and [[sanctification]] of those who believed in him, and he explicitly excludes praying for all: \"I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.\"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|17:9b|ESV}}. Paul instructs the [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s in [[Ephesus]] \"to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood,\"<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Acts 20:28]]<nowiki>]</nowiki></sup> and he says in his letter to the same church that \"Christ loved the church and gave himself up ''for her.''\"{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:25|ESV}} Likewise, Jesus foreshadows that he will lay down his life \"for his friends,\"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|15:13|ESV|Jon 15:13 cf. Jn 10:15}} and an [[angel]] tells Jesus' earthly father Joseph that he \"will save ''His people'' from their sins\".{{Bibleref2c|Mat|1:21|ESV}} Calvinists believe that these passages demonstrate that Jesus died for the church (that is, the elect) only.\n\nOpponents to Calvinism often cite passages such as those below they believe clearly contradict limited atonement:\n\n# Jesus promises that whosoever believes in him has everlasting life. <sup>{{bibleref|John|3:16|9}}</sup>\n# Peter proclaims that everyone who calls upon Jesus will be saved. <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|2:21|9}}</sup>\n# God calls all people everywhere to repent. <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|17:30|9}}, {{bibleref|2 Peter|3:9|9}}</sup>\n# God desires all people to be saved. <sup>{{bibleref|1 Timothy|2:4|9}}</sup>\n# Jesus is a ransom for all. <sup>{{bibleref|1 Timothy|2:6|9}}</sup>\n# Jesus is the propitiation \"for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.\" <sup>{{bibleref|1 John|2:2|9}}</sup>\n\n=== Confessional positions ===\n\nChapter 3, paragraph 6 of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] says, \"Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.\"\n\nThe [[Canons of Dort]] assert that \"This death of God's Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world\" (Section 2, Article 3). Article 8 of the same section says\n<blockquote>\nFor it was the entirely free plan and very gracious will and intention of God the Father that the enlivening and saving effectiveness of his Son's costly death should work itself out in all his chosen ones, in order that he might grant justifying faith to them only and thereby lead them without fail to salvation. In other words, it was God's will that Christ through the blood of the cross (by which he confirmed the new covenant) should effectively redeem from every people, tribe, nation, and language all those and only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation and given to him by the Father; that he should grant them faith (which, like the Holy Spirit's other saving gifts, he acquired for them by his death); that he should cleanse them by his blood from all their sins, both original and actual, whether committed before or after their coming to faith; that he should faithfully preserve them to the very end; and that he should finally present them to himself, a glorious people, without spot or wrinkle.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Objections to the doctrine ==\n\nLimited atonement is contrasted with the view popularly termed [[unlimited atonement]], which is advocated by [[Arminianism|Arminian]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], [[Messianic Jewish]], and [[Roman Catholic]] theologians (among others) and which says Christ's work makes redemption possible for all but certain for none. (This doctrine should not be confused with concepts of [[universal reconciliation]], in which God saves his entire creation). Though Lutherans and Catholics share a similar doctrine of the nature of the atonement with Calvinists, they differ on its extent, whereas Arminians and Methodists generally accept an alternate theory of the nature of the atonement such as the [[Atonement (Governmental view)|moral government theory]]. The elect in such models are all the people who choose to avail themselves of God's gracious offer of salvation through Christ, not a pre-determined group. Thus, these systems place a limit on the efficacy of the atonement rather than on its extent, like Calvinists.\n\nSome have contended that the doctrine of particular redemption implies that Christ's sacrifice was insufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world, but Calvinists have universally rejected this notion, instead holding that the value of the atonement is infinite but that God intentionally withholds its efficacious availability only to the elect.\n\n=== Comparison among Protestants ===\n\nThis table summarizes three different Protestant beliefs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For the opponents of Arminius, whose views are represented in the [[Canons of Dort]], this efficacy was limited based on God's predestination, without any foreknowledge of human choice.<ref>{{cite book|title=Calvin and the Reformed Tradition|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2012|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|page=52|edition=Ebook|authorlink=Richard A.

Muller (theologian)}}</ref>.\n\nThe doctrine of limited atonement also includes the claim that the purpose for which Jesus gave his life was limited to the elect - the ''atonement'' is ''limited'' in its purpose.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sproul |first1=R.C. |title=TULIP and Reformed Theology: Limited Atonement |url=https://www.ligonier.org/blog/tulip-and-reformed-theology-limited-atonement/ |website=Ligonier Ministries |accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref>. For this reason, the so-called [[History_of_the_Calvinist-Arminian_debate#Four-point_Calvinists|\"four-point Calvinists\"]], such as the 17th century English Puritan [[Richard Baxter]], reject the doctrine of limited atonement and instead believe that the atonement is available to all who will believe in Christ. They also argue that it was never endorsed by Calvin or the Synod of Dort. They refer to both Calvin's claim that \"It is also a fact, without controversy, that Christ came to atone for the sins 'of the whole world'\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Calvin |first1=John |title=Concerning the Eternal Predestination of God |date=1552 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press}}</ref> and to Article 3 of the Second Main Point of Doctrine of the Synod of Dort which states that \"This death of God's Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Canons of Dort |url=https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/canons-dort#3550 |website=Christian Reformed Church |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>.  Others, however, claim that Calvin and the Canons of Dort are somewhat vague on this issue<ref name=\"Muller 2012 53\"/> and accept the claim of limited atonement that the efficacy of his death was limited both in purpose and scope to the elect, though they believe his death was sufficient payment for the sin of the whole world. \n\nWith regard to the limited purpose or intent of the atonement to save only the elect, another argument was put forth later in the 17th century. [[Moses Amyraut]] and several others ([[Amyraldist]]s) proposed a system called [[hypothetical universalism]], which taught that in God's decree for Christ to be a sufficient atonement for all sin, his intention was to save all on condition that they believe. This decree was prior to his decree to elect some people for whom the atonement was to be efficacious, and so the efficacy of the atonement was still limited to the elect. Most of the Reformed rejected this view because it envisioned a decree of God (the conditional decree to save all) that was intentionally not realized.<ref>{{cite book|title=After Calvin|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2003|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]{{subscription required}}|p=14&ndash;15|authorlink=Richard A. Muller (theologian)|url=https://www.questia.com/read/105180022/after-calvin-studies-in-the-development-of-a-theological}}</ref>\n\n== Theology ==\n\nThe doctrine of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the doctrine of the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. It also has much to do with the general [[predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist view of predestination]]. Calvinists advocate the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]], which developed in the writings of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as [[penal substitution]], states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the [[sin]]s of men&mdash;that is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men{{Bibleref2c|2Cor|5:21|KJV}}{{Bibleref2c|Rom|8:3b|KJV}}.\n\nThe doctrine of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ has taken the penalty of the elect - that Jesus died for those who would believe, so that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.\n\nThe Calvinist view of [[predestination]] teaches that God created Adam in a state of original righteousness, but he fell into sin and all humanity in him as their [[Covenant theology|federal head]]. Those elected to salvation were chosen without a view to their faith or good works but by the sovereign will of God.\n\nThe Calvinist atonement is called ''definite'' by some because they believe it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called ''limited'' in its extent because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, which is to say that no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic [[Particular Baptists|(Particular) Baptists]], the doctrine was usually known as ''particular redemption'', giving its adherents the name [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]]. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in ''general'' as [[General Baptist]]s believe.\n\n=== Biblical passages ===\n\nThe classic [[Bible]] passage cited to prove a limited extent to the atonement is {{Bibleref2|John|10|ESV}} in which Jesus uses [[shepherd]]ing practices as a [[metaphor]] for his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.{{Bibleref2c|Jn|10:1-5|ESV}}. In that context, Jesus says, \"I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life ''for the sheep,''\"{{Bibleref2c|John|10:14-15|ESV}} and he tells the [[Pharisee]]s that they \"do not believe because [they] are not part of [his] flock.\"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|10:26|ESV}} He continues, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.\" {{Bibleref2c-nb|Jn|10:27f|ESV}} Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand {{Bibleref2|John|10|ESV}} to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way:\n\n# Jesus lays down his life for the sheep.{{Bibleref2c|John|10:14-15|ESV}}\n# Jesus will lose none of his sheep.{{Bibleref2c|John|10:28|ESV}}\n# Many people will not receive eternal life.{{Bibleref2c|Mat|7:13-14|ESV}}\n:Therefore, the Calvinist position is that Jesus did not die for everyone, but only for those whom the Father purposed to save.\n\nAdditionally, in the high priestly prayer, Jesus prays for the protection and [[sanctification]] of those who believed in him, and he explicitly excludes praying for all: \"I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.\"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|17:9b|ESV}}. Paul instructs the [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s in [[Ephesus]] \"to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood,\"<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Acts 20:28]]<nowiki>]</nowiki></sup> and he says in his letter to the same church that \"Christ loved the church and gave himself up ''for her.''\"{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:25|ESV}} Likewise, Jesus foreshadows that he will lay down his life \"for his friends,\"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|15:13|ESV|Jon 15:13 cf. Jn 10:15}} and an [[angel]] tells Jesus' earthly father Joseph that he \"will save ''His people'' from their sins\".{{Bibleref2c|Mat|1:21|ESV}} Calvinists believe that these passages demonstrate that Jesus died for the church (that is, the elect) only.\n\nOpponents to Calvinism often cite passages such as those below they believe clearly contradict limited atonement:\n\n# Jesus promises that whosoever believes in him has everlasting life. <sup>{{bibleref|John|3:16|9}}</sup>\n# Peter proclaims that everyone who calls upon Jesus will be saved. <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|2:21|9}}</sup>\n# God calls all people everywhere to repent. <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|17:30|9}}, {{bibleref|2 Peter|3:9|9}}</sup>\n# God desires all people to be saved. <sup>{{bibleref|1 Timothy|2:4|9}}</sup>\n# Jesus is a ransom for all. <sup>{{bibleref|1 Timothy|2:6|9}}</sup>\n# Jesus is the propitiation \"for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.\" <sup>{{bibleref|1 John|2:2|9}}</sup>\n\n=== Confessional positions ===\n\nChapter 3, paragraph 6 of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] says, \"Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.\"\n\nThe [[Canons of Dort]] assert that \"This death of God's Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world\" (Section 2, Article 3). Article 8 of the same section says\n<blockquote>\nFor it was the entirely free plan and very gracious will and intention of God the Father that the enlivening and saving effectiveness of his Son's costly death should work itself out in all his chosen ones, in order that he might grant justifying faith to them only and thereby lead them without fail to salvation. In other words, it was God's will that Christ through the blood of the cross (by which he confirmed the new covenant) should effectively redeem from every people, tribe, nation, and language all those and only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation and given to him by the Father; that he should grant them faith (which, like the Holy Spirit's other saving gifts, he acquired for them by his death); that he should cleanse them by his blood from all their sins, both original and actual, whether committed before or after their coming to faith; that he should faithfully preserve them to the very end; and that he should finally present them to himself, a glorious people, without spot or wrinkle.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Objections to the doctrine ==\n\nLimited atonement is contrasted with the view popularly termed [[unlimited atonement]], which is advocated by [[Arminianism|Arminian]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], [[Messianic Jewish]], and [[Roman Catholic]] theologians (among others) and which says Christ's work makes redemption possible for all but certain for none. (This doctrine should not be confused with concepts of [[universal reconciliation]], in which God saves his entire creation). Though Lutherans and Catholics share a similar doctrine of the nature of the atonement with Calvinists, they differ on its extent, whereas Arminians and Methodists generally accept an alternate theory of the nature of the atonement such as the [[Atonement (Governmental view)|moral government theory]]. The elect in such models are all the people who choose to avail themselves of God's gracious offer of salvation through Christ, not a pre-determined group. Thus, these systems place a limit on the efficacy of the atonement rather than on its extent, like Calvinists.\n\nSome have contended that the doctrine of particular redemption implies that Christ's sacrifice was insufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world, but Calvinists have universally rejected this notion, instead holding that the value of the atonement is infinite but that God intentionally withholds its efficacious availability only to the elect.\n\n=== Comparison among Protestants ===\n\nThis table summarizes three different Protestant beliefs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion.

Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA.

In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion.

[[Vittorio Benussi]] was the first to work on practical deception tests based on physiological changes.  He detected changes in inspiration-expiration ratio\u2014findings confirmed by N.E. Burtt.  Burtt conducted studies that emphasized the changes in quantitative systolic blood-pressure. [[William Moulton Marston]] studied blood-pressure and noted increase in systolic blood pressure of 10&nbsp;mm Hg or over indicated guilt through using the tycos [[sphygmomanometer]], with which he reported 90\u2013100% accuracy.  His studies used students and actual court cases. Then in 1913 W.M. Marston determined systolic blood-pressure by oscillatory methods and his findings cite definite changes in blood pressure during the deception of criminal suspects. In 1921, [[John Augustus Larson]] criticized Marston's intermittent blood pressure method because emotional changes were so brief they could be lost. To adjust for this he modified the Erlanger [[sphygmograph]] to give a continuous blood pressure and pulse curve and used it to study 4,000 criminals.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite journal|last=Keeler|first=Leonarde|title=A Method for Detecting Deception|journal=American Journal of Police Science|date=January 1930|volume=1|issue=1|pages=38\u201351|doi=10.2307/1147254|jstor=1147254}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nTwo meta-analyses conducted by 2004 found an association between lying and increased pupil size and compressed lips.

It is currently being automated for use in law enforcement and is still being improved to increase accuracy. His studies use micro-expressions, which last less than one-fifth of a second, and \"may leak emotions someone wants to conceal, such as anger or guilt.\"  However, \"signs of emotion aren't necessarily signs of guilt.  An innocent person may be apprehensive and appear guilty,\" Ekman reminds us.\nWith regard to his studies, lies about emotions at the moment have the biggest payoff from face and voice cues while lies about beliefs and actions, such as crimes use cues from gestures and words are added.  Ekman and his associates have validated many signs of deception, but do not publish all of them as not to educate criminals<ref name=Adelson />\n\n[[James Pennebaker]] uses the method of [[Linguistic Inquiry]] and Word Count (LIWC), published by [[Lawrence Erlbaum]], to conduct an analysis of written content.  He claims it has accuracy in predicting lying.  Pennebaker cites his method as \"significantly more effective than human judges in correctly identifying deceptive or truthful writing samples\"; there is a 67% accuracy rate with his method, while trained people have 52% accuracy. There were five experimental procedures used in this study. Study 1\u20133 asked participants to speak, hand write or type a true or false statement about abortion. The participants were randomly assigned to tell a true or false statement. Study 4 focused on feelings about friends and study 5 had the students involved in a mock crime and asked to lie. Human judges were asked to rate the truthfulness of the 400 communications dealing with abortion. The judges read or watched the statement and gave it a yes or no answer about if this statement was false or not. LIWC correctly classified 67% of the abortion communications and the judges correctly classified 52%. His studies have identified that deception carries three primary written markers.  The first is fewer first-person pronouns.  Those lying \"avoid statements of ownership, distance themselves from their stories and avoid taking responsibility for their behavior\" while also using more negative emotion words such as \"hate, worthless and sad.\"  Second, they use \"few exclusionary words such as except, but or nor\" when \"distinguish[ing] what they did from what they did not do.\"<ref name=Adelson />\n\nMore recently evidence has been provided by the work of CA Morgan III and GA Hazlett that a computer analysis of cognitive interview derived speech content (i.e. response length and unique word count) provides a method for detecting deception that is both demonstrably better than professional judgments of professionals and useful at distinguishing between genuine and false adult claims of exposure to highly stressful, potentially traumatic events.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Efficacy of forensic statement analysis in distinguishing truthful from deceptive eyewitness accounts of highly stressful events|author=Morgan CA 3rd |journal=Nih.gov|display-authors=etal|pmid=21854383|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01896.x|volume=56|issue=5 |year=2011|pages=1227\u20131234}}</ref> This method shows particular promise as it is non confrontational as well as scientifically and cross culturally valid.\n\n==General questioning and testing techniques==\nThere are typically three types of questions used in polygraph testing or voice stress analysis testing:\n\nIrrelevant questions establish a baseline to compare other answers by asking simple questions with clear true and false answers.\n\nComparison questions have an indirect relationship to the event or circumstance, and they are designed to encourage the subject to lie.\n\nRelevant questions are compared against comparison questions (which should represent false answers) and irrelevant questions (which should represent true answers).

They often fit into an actual scenario to make recall easier. \u00a0\n\n==The control question test and the guilty knowledge test==\n{{see also|Polygraph#Testing procedure}}\nThe ''control question test'' (CQT) uses control questions, with known answers, to serve as a physiological baseline in order to compare them with questions relevant to a particular incident. The control question should have a greater physiological response if truth was told and a lesser physiological response for lying.<ref name=Preston>{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=Elizabeth|title=Detecting Deception|journal=Observer|date=July 2002|volume=15|issue=6|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/uncategorized/detecting-deception.html|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref> The ''guilty knowledge test'' (GKT) is a multiple-choice format in which answer choices or one correct answer and additional incorrect answers are read and the physiological response is recorded. The controls are the incorrect alternative answers. The greater physiological response should be to the correct answer.<ref name=Preston /> Its point is to determine if the subject has knowledge about a particular event.<ref name=Parliament/>\n\nBoth are considered to be biased against those that are innocent, because the guilty who fear the consequences of being found out can be more motivated to cheat on the test. Various techniques (which can be found online) can teach individuals how to change the results of the tests, including curling the toes, and biting the tongue. Mental arithmetic was found to be ineffective by at least one study, especially in students counting backward by seven. A study has found that in the guilty knowledge test subjects can focusing on the alternative answers and make themselves look innocent.<ref name=Preston/>\n\n==Polygraph==\n{{main|Polygraph}}\n\nLie detection commonly involves the [[polygraph]], <ref name=\":0\" /> and is used to test both styles of deception. It detects [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] reactions<ref name=\"Adelson\" />, such as micro-expressions, breathing rate, skin conductivity, and [[heart rate]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/psychology/psychology_6.shtml Forensic Psychology]. BBC Science & Nature.</ref>  Microexpressions are the brief and incomplete nonverbal changes in expression while the rest show an activation of the nervous system<ref name=\":0\" />. These changes in body functions are not easily controlled by the conscious mind. They also may consider [[respiration rate]], [[blood pressure]], capillary dilation, and muscular movement. While taking a polygraph test the subject wears a blood pressure device to measure blood pressure fluctuations. Respiration is measured by wearing pneumographs around the chest, and finally electrodes are placed on the subject's fingers to measure skin conductivity. To determine truth it is assumed the subject will show more signs of fear when answering the control questions compared with the relevant questions.  Polygraphs focus more on the exams predictive value of guilt by comparing the responses of the participant to control questions, irrelevant questions, and relevant questions to gauge arousal, which is then interpreted as a display of fear and deception is assumed<ref name=\":0\" />. If a person is showing a deception there will be changes in the autonomic arousal responses to the relevant questions. Results are considered inconclusive if there is no fluctuation in any of the questions.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Lie Detectors (aka Polygraph Tests)| url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx|website=apa.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThese measures are supposed to indicate a short-term [[stress response]] which can be from lying or significance to the subject. The problem becomes that they are also associated with mental effort and [[emotional state]], so they can be influenced by fear, anger, and surprise for example.  This technique may also be used with CQT and GKT.<ref name=Parliament /> \n\nThere are many issues with polygraph tests because many people have found ways to try and cheat the system. Some people have been known to take sedatives to reduce anxiety; using antiperspirant to prevent sweating; and positioning pins or biting parts of the mouth after each question to demonstrate a constant physiological response.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Center|first1=Electronic Privacy Information|title=Polygraph Testing|url=https://epic.org/privacy/polygraph/|website=epic.org (EPIC)|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>As technology and research have developed many have moved away from polygraphing because of the drawbacks of this style of detection.

Usually this involves asking the subject control questions where the answers are known to the examiner and comparing them to questions where the answers are not known.

This suggests that the DKS model may have a correlate in mnemonic operations. In other words, the DKS model may have a discrete knowledge base (DKB) of essential components needed for task resolution, while for nDKS, DKB is absent and, hence, a \"global\" or bi-hemispheric search occurs. Based on the latter premise, a 'lie detector' system was designed as described in {{US Patent|6390979|United State Patent No. 6,390,979}}. A pattern of blood-flow-velocity changes is obtained in response to questions that include correct and incorrect answers. The wrong answer will elicit bi-hemispheric activation, from correct answer that activates unilateral response. Cognitive polygraphy based on this system is devoid of any subjective control of mental processes and, hence, high reliability and specificity; however, this is yet to be tested in forensic practice. See also cognitive [[biometrics]].\n\n==ERP==\n{{main|Event-related potentials}}\n[[Event-related potentials]] assess recognition, and therefore may or may not be effective in assessing deception.  In ERP studies P3 amplitude waves are assessed, with these waves being large when an item is recognized.<ref name=Preston />\nHowever, P100 amplitudes have been observed to have significant correlation to trustworthiness ratings, the importance of which will be discussed in the EEG section.  This, along with other studies leads some to purport that because ERP studies rely on quick perceptual processes they \"are integral to the detection of deception.\"<ref name=Heussen />\n\n==EEG==\n{{main|Electroencephalography}}\n[[Electroencephalography]], or EEG, measures brain activity through electrodes attached to the scalp of a subject.  The object is to identify the recognition of meaningful data through this activity.  Images or objects are shown to the subject while questioning techniques are implemented to determine recognition. This can include crime scene images, for example.<ref name=Parliament />\n\nPerceived trustworthiness is interpreted by the individual from looking at a face, and this  decreases when someone is lying.  Such observations are \"too subtle to be explicitly processed by observers, but [do] affect implicit cognitive and affective processes.\"  These results, in a study by Heussen, Binkofski, and Jolij, were obtained through a study with an [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] paradigm including two conditions within the experiment:  truthful faces and lying faces. Faces flashed for 100ms and then the participants rated them.

This is not an emotional reaction like the polygraph and other methods but rather a cognitive reaction.  This technology measures pupil dilation, response time, reading and rereading time, and errors.  Data is recorded while subjects answer true or false questions on a computer.<ref name=Eye-Tracking />\n\nThey have found that more effort is required by lying than giving the truth and thus their aim is to find indications of hard work.  Individuals not telling the truth might, for instance, have dilated pupils while also taking longer to answer the question.<ref name=Eye-Tracking />\n\nEye-tracking offers several benefits over the polygraph: lower cost, 1/5th of the time to conduct, subjects do not need to be \"hooked up\" to anything, and it does not require qualified polygraph examiners to give the test.<ref name=Eye-Tracking />\n\n==Voice stress analysis==\n[[Voice stress analysis]] (also called voice risk analysis) uses computers to compare [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[frequency]], intensity and micro tremors.  In this way voice analysis \"detect[s] minute variations in the voice thought to signal lying.\"  It can even be used covertly over the phone, and has been used by banking and insurance companies as well as the government of the United Kingdom. Customers are assessed for truth in certain situations by banks and insurance companies where computers are used to record responses.  Software then compares control questions to relevant questions assessed for deception. However, its reliability has been debated by peer-reviewed journals.<ref name=Parliament /> \"When a person lies, an involuntary interference of the nerves causes the vocal cords to produce a distorted sound wave, namely a frequency level which is different from the one produced by the same person when telling the truth.\"<ref>S.

Washington, DC: The National Academic Press.</ref>\n\n==FMRI==\n\n=== Future ===\nResearchers have turned to looking for other ways to track deception. The most promising fields are [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]. EEG and fMRI both look to the [[central nervous system]] to compare time and topography of activity in the brain for lie detection. While a polygraph detects changes in activity in the [[peripheral nervous system]], fMRI has the potential to catch the lie at the 'source'. To better understand why fMRI, lie detection is the future of lie detection one must first understand how it works.\n\n=== fMRI ===\nAs Prospects of fMRI as a Lie Detector<ref name=\":1\" />, states fMRIs use electromagnets to create pulse sequences in the cells of the brain. The fMRI scanner then detects the different pulses and fields that are used to distinguish tissue structures and the distinction between layers of the brain, matter type, and the ability to see growths. The functional component allows researchers to see activation in the brain over time and assess efficiency and connectivity by compairing blood use in the brain, which allows for the identification of which portions of the brain are using more oxygen, and thus being used during a specific task. This is called the [[Blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging|Blood Oxygen Level Dependent]] or BOLD hemodynamic response.<ref name=\"Simpson2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Simpson JR|year=2008|title=Functional MRI lie detection: too good to be true?|url=|journal=J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry Law|volume=36|issue=4|pages=491\u2013498|doi=|pmid=19092066}}</ref>. \u00a0fMRI is a correlational machine that looks at both brain structure and activity, yet it does not allow for causal conclusions about brain areas and behaviors or mental processes. \n\n=== Research ===\nTo study deception researchers map the systematic procedure the brain went through to produce the action or decision. Subjects are often offered monetary incentive for their participation. To begin it is important to note areas of the brain that are activated in telling the truth. In an experiment where participants were asked to provide an honest answer based on pre-checked information. \n\n=== Brain Activation ===\nActivation of [[Brodmann area 40|BA 40]], the superior parietal lobe, the lateral left MRG, the striatum, and left thalamus was unique<ref name=\":0\" /> to truth while activation of the [[precuneus]], [[Posterior cingulate cortex|posterior cingulate gyrus]], [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[cerebellum]] will be used to show a similar network for truth and lie<ref name=\":0\" />. The most brain activity occurs in both sides of the prefrontal cortex, which is linked to response inhibition. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. Overall bilateral activation occurs in deception in the [[middle frontal gyrus]], [[Parahippocampal gyrus]], the precuneus, and the cerebellum<ref name=\":0\" />. When looking into the different styles of lying we see differentiation in the locations of activation. Spontaneous lies require retrieval from the semantic and episodic memory to be able to quickly formulate a viable situation that remains in working memory while visual images are created to further hide the truth. The areas associated with this retrieval, the [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[Brodmann area 10|anterior prefrontal cortex]], and precuneus, are activated as well as the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]], and posterior visual cortex are activated. The anterior cingulate cortex is used for cross-checking and probability. For well-rehearsed, memorized, and coherent lies episodic memory activation is needed. This creates increased activation in the right anterior prefrontal cortex, BA 10, and the precuneus. The Parahippocampal cortex may be used in this process to generalize lies to situations because no cross-checking is needed. Newer studies have considered the salience of lying in a variety of situations<ref name=\":0\" />. If a lie is of lower salience activation is broader and general while salient lies have specific activation in regions associated with inhibition and selection.<ref>Langleben, D.D., Loughead, J.W., Bilker, W.B., Ruparel, K., Childress, A.R., Busch, S.I. and Gur, R.C.

Brain Mapp., 26: 262-272. doi:10.1002/hbm.20191</ref> Many areas are much more active in lying than truth possibly meaning its harder to retrieve false information compared to true memories<ref name=\":1\" /> because truth has more encoded retrieval cues. Interestingly, the [[limbic system]], which is involved in many different emotional responses including the sympathetic nervous system, is not activated in deception.<ref name=\":2\">Commentary: The Future of Forensic Functional Brain Imaging\n\nDaniel D. Langleben, Frank M. Dattilio\n\nJournal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online Dec 2008, 36 (4) 502-504; </ref> \n\n=== Legality ===\nHistorically, fMRI lie detector tests have not been allowed into evidence in legal proceedings, the most famous attempt being Harvey Nathan\u2019s insurance fraud case<ref name=\":2\" /> in 2007<ref name=\":1\" />. This pushback from the legal system may be based on the 1988 Federal Employment Polygraph Protection Act<ref name=\":2\" /> that acts to protect citizens from incriminating themselves and the right to silence. The legal system specifically would require many more studies on the negative false rate to decide if the absence of deception proves innocence. The lack of legal support has not stopped companies like No Lie MRI and CEPHOS from offering private fMRI scans to test deception. \u00a0\n\n=== Pros and Cons ===\nWhile fMRI studies on deception have claimed detection accuracy as high as 90% many have problems with implementing this style of detection. At a basic level administering, fMRIs is extremely difficult and costly. Only yes or no answers can be used which allows for flexibility<ref name=\":1\" /> in the truth and style of lying. fMRI requires the participant to remain still for long periods and little movements can create issues with the scan<ref name=\":1\" />. Some people are unable to take one such as those with medical conditions, claustrophobia, or implants<ref name=\":1\" />. When looking at deception specifically, there is little research on non-compliant individuals. The criminal justice system interacts with many types of criminals that are not often taken into account in fMRI studies such as addicts, juveniles, mentally unstable, and the elderly<ref name=\":1\" />. Studies have been done on Chinese individuals and their language and cultural differences did not change results, as well as a study (S. Spence 2011) on that 52 schizophrenic patients, 27 of whom were experiencing delusions at the time of the study. While these studies are promising, the lack of extensive research on the populations that would be most affected by fMRIs being admitted into the legal system is a huge drawback. As well, fMRI deception tests look only at changes in activity in the brain which similarly to the polygraph does not show directly that lying is occurring<ref name=\":1\" />. If dealing with complex styles of lying or questions the need for a control condition<ref>Langleben, D.D., Loughead, J.W., Bilker, W.B., Ruparel, K., Childress, A.R., Busch, S.I. and Gur, R.C. (2005), Telling truth from lie in individual subjects with fast event\u2010related fMRI. Hum. Brain Mapp., 26: 262-272. doi:10.1002/hbm.20191</ref> is critical to differentiate from other higher emotional states unrelated to deception. Some studies, such as Ganis et al<ref name=\":1\" />., have shown that it is possible to fool an fMRI by learning countermeasures. \n\n==fNIRS==\n{{main|Functional near-infrared spectroscopy}}\n[[Functional near-infrared spectroscopy]] also detects oxygen and activity in the brain like the fMRI, but instead it looks at blood oxygen levels.  It is advantageous to the fMRI because it is portable, however its image resolution is of lower quality than the fMRI.<ref name=Parliament />\n\n==Brain observations==\n[[Electroencephalography]] is used to detect changes in brain waves.\n\n[[Cognitive chronometry]], or the measurement of the time taken to perform mental operations, can be used to distinguish lying from truth-telling. One recent instrument using cognitive chronometry for this purpose is the [[timed antagonistic response alethiometer]], or TARA.\n\n[[Brain-reading]] uses [[fMRI]] and the multiple voxels activated in the brain evoked by a stimulus to determine what the brain has detected, and so whether it is familiar.\n\n==Nonverbal behavior==\n{{Advert|date=March 2018}}\nPeople often evaluate lies based on non-verbal behavior, but are quick to place too much merit in misleading indicators, such as: avoidance of eye contact, increased pauses between statements, and excessive movements originating from the hands or feet.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akehurst|last2=Koehnken|title=Lay persons' and police officers' beliefs regarding deceptive behavior.|url=|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=10|issue=6|pages=461\u2013471|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0720(199612)10:6<461::aid-acp413>3.3.co;2-u|year=1996}}</ref> Non-invasive lie detection using non-verbal behavior is performed by the [[Silent Talker Lie Detector]].

Additionally, [[psychological disorders]] can cause problems with data as certain disorders can lead a person to make a statement they believe to be truth but is actually a fabrication.

[[Vittorio Benussi]] was the first to work on practical deception tests based on physiological changes.  He detected changes in inspiration-expiration ratio\u2014findings confirmed by N.E. Burtt.  Burtt conducted studies that emphasized the changes in quantitative systolic blood-pressure. [[William Moulton Marston]] studied blood-pressure and noted increase in systolic blood pressure of 10&nbsp;mm Hg or over indicated guilt through using the tycos [[sphygmomanometer]], with which he reported 90\u2013100% accuracy.  His studies used students and actual court cases. Then in 1913 W.M. Marston determined systolic blood-pressure by oscillatory methods and his findings cite definite changes in blood pressure during the deception of criminal suspects. In 1921, [[John Augustus Larson]] criticized Marston's intermittent blood pressure method because emotional changes were so brief they could be lost. To adjust for this he modified the Erlanger [[sphygmograph]] to give a continuous blood pressure and pulse curve and used it to study 4,000 criminals.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite journal|last=Keeler|first=Leonarde|title=A Method for Detecting Deception|journal=American Journal of Police Science|date=January 1930|volume=1|issue=1|pages=38\u201351|doi=10.2307/1147254|jstor=1147254}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nTwo meta-analyses conducted by 2004 found an association between lying and increased pupil size and compressed lips. Liars may stay still more, use fewer hand gestures, and make less eye contact.

His studies use micro-expressions, which last less than one-fifth of a second, and \"may leak emotions someone wants to conceal, such as anger or guilt.\"  However, \"signs of emotion aren't necessarily signs of guilt.  An innocent person may be apprehensive and appear guilty,\" Ekman reminds us.\nWith regard to his studies, lies about emotions at the moment have the biggest payoff from face and voice cues while lies about beliefs and actions, such as crimes use cues from gestures and words are added.  Ekman and his associates have validated many signs of deception, but do not publish all of them as not to educate criminals<ref name=Adelson />\n\n[[James Pennebaker]] uses the method of [[Linguistic Inquiry]] and Word Count (LIWC), published by [[Lawrence Erlbaum]], to conduct an analysis of written content.  He claims it has accuracy in predicting lying.  Pennebaker cites his method as \"significantly more effective than human judges in correctly identifying deceptive or truthful writing samples\"; there is a 67% accuracy rate with his method, while trained people have 52% accuracy. There were five experimental procedures used in this study. Study 1\u20133 asked participants to speak, hand write or type a true or false statement about abortion. The participants were randomly assigned to tell a true or false statement. Study 4 focused on feelings about friends and study 5 had the students involved in a mock crime and asked to lie. Human judges were asked to rate the truthfulness of the 400 communications dealing with abortion. The judges read or watched the statement and gave it a yes or no answer about if this statement was false or not. LIWC correctly classified 67% of the abortion communications and the judges correctly classified 52%. His studies have identified that deception carries three primary written markers.  The first is fewer first-person pronouns.  Those lying \"avoid statements of ownership, distance themselves from their stories and avoid taking responsibility for their behavior\" while also using more negative emotion words such as \"hate, worthless and sad.\"  Second, they use \"few exclusionary words such as except, but or nor\" when \"distinguish[ing] what they did from what they did not do.\"<ref name=Adelson />\n\nMore recently evidence has been provided by the work of CA Morgan III and GA Hazlett that a computer analysis of cognitive interview derived speech content (i.e. response length and unique word count) provides a method for detecting deception that is both demonstrably better than professional judgments of professionals and useful at distinguishing between genuine and false adult claims of exposure to highly stressful, potentially traumatic events.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Efficacy of forensic statement analysis in distinguishing truthful from deceptive eyewitness accounts of highly stressful events|author=Morgan CA 3rd |journal=Nih.gov|display-authors=etal|pmid=21854383|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01896.x|volume=56|issue=5 |year=2011|pages=1227\u20131234}}</ref> This method shows particular promise as it is non confrontational as well as scientifically and cross culturally valid.\n\n==General questioning and testing techniques==\nThere are typically three types of questions used in polygraph testing or voice stress analysis testing:\n\nIrrelevant questions establish a baseline to compare other answers by asking simple questions with clear true and false answers.\n\nComparison questions have an indirect relationship to the event or circumstance, and they are designed to encourage the subject to lie.\n\nRelevant questions are compared against comparison questions (which should represent false answers) and irrelevant questions (which should represent true answers).  They are about whatever is particularly in question\n\n== Deception ==\nDeception is the action of one person attempting to convince another person to accept something as correct that they believe as incorrect or denying what is correct and is often used to avoid punishment or gain a benefit.<ref name=\":0\">G.

They often fit into an actual scenario to make recall easier. \u00a0\n\n==The control question test and the guilty knowledge test==\n{{see also|Polygraph#Testing procedure}}\nThe ''control question test'' (CQT) uses control questions, with known answers, to serve as a physiological baseline in order to compare them with questions relevant to a particular incident. The control question should have a greater physiological response if truth was told and a lesser physiological response for lying.<ref name=Preston>{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=Elizabeth|title=Detecting Deception|journal=Observer|date=July 2002|volume=15|issue=6|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/uncategorized/detecting-deception.html|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref> The ''guilty knowledge test'' (GKT) is a multiple-choice format in which answer choices or one correct answer and additional incorrect answers are read and the physiological response is recorded. The controls are the incorrect alternative answers. The greater physiological response should be to the correct answer.<ref name=Preston /> Its point is to determine if the subject has knowledge about a particular event.<ref name=Parliament/>\n\nBoth are considered to be biased against those that are innocent, because the guilty who fear the consequences of being found out can be more motivated to cheat on the test. Various techniques (which can be found online) can teach individuals how to change the results of the tests, including curling the toes, and biting the tongue. Mental arithmetic was found to be ineffective by at least one study, especially in students counting backward by seven. A study has found that in the guilty knowledge test subjects can focusing on the alternative answers and make themselves look innocent.<ref name=Preston/>\n\n==Polygraph==\n{{main|Polygraph}}\n\nLie detection commonly involves the [[polygraph]], <ref name=\":0\" /> and is used to test both styles of deception. It detects [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] reactions<ref name=\"Adelson\" />, such as micro-expressions, breathing rate, skin conductivity, and [[heart rate]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/psychology/psychology_6.shtml Forensic Psychology]. BBC Science & Nature.</ref>  Microexpressions are the brief and incomplete nonverbal changes in expression while the rest show an activation of the nervous system<ref name=\":0\" />. These changes in body functions are not easily controlled by the conscious mind. They also may consider [[respiration rate]], [[blood pressure]], capillary dilation, and muscular movement. While taking a polygraph test the subject wears a blood pressure device to measure blood pressure fluctuations. Respiration is measured by wearing pneumographs around the chest, and finally electrodes are placed on the subject's fingers to measure skin conductivity. To determine truth it is assumed the subject will show more signs of fear when answering the control questions compared with the relevant questions.  Polygraphs focus more on the exams predictive value of guilt by comparing the responses of the participant to control questions, irrelevant questions, and relevant questions to gauge arousal, which is then interpreted as a display of fear and deception is assumed<ref name=\":0\" />. If a person is showing a deception there will be changes in the autonomic arousal responses to the relevant questions. Results are considered inconclusive if there is no fluctuation in any of the questions.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Lie Detectors (aka Polygraph Tests)| url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx|website=apa.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThese measures are supposed to indicate a short-term [[stress response]] which can be from lying or significance to the subject. The problem becomes that they are also associated with mental effort and [[emotional state]], so they can be influenced by fear, anger, and surprise for example.  This technique may also be used with CQT and GKT.<ref name=Parliament /> \n\nThere are many issues with polygraph tests because many people have found ways to try and cheat the system. Some people have been known to take sedatives to reduce anxiety; using antiperspirant to prevent sweating; and positioning pins or biting parts of the mouth after each question to demonstrate a constant physiological response.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Center|first1=Electronic Privacy Information|title=Polygraph Testing|url=https://epic.org/privacy/polygraph/|website=epic.org (EPIC)|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>As technology and research have developed many have moved away from polygraphing because of the drawbacks of this style of detection. Polygraphing has a 70% accuracy rate, which is only 16% better than lie detection in the general population<ref name=\":1\">Rusconi, Elena, and Timothy Mitchener-Nissen. \u201cProspects of functional magnetic resonance imaging as lie detector.\u201d ''Frontiers in human neuroscience''vol. 7 594. 24 Sep. 2013, doi:10.3389/fnhum.2013.00594</ref>.\n\nActivities of the body not easily controlled by the conscious mind are compared under different circumstances. Usually this involves asking the subject control questions where the answers are known to the examiner and comparing them to questions where the answers are not known. Critics claim that \"lie detection\" by use of [[polygraphy]] has no scientific validity because it is not a scientific procedure.<ref>[http://antipolygraph.org/lie-behind-the-lie-detector.pdf The Lie Behind the Lie Detector by George W.

This suggests that the DKS model may have a correlate in mnemonic operations. In other words, the DKS model may have a discrete knowledge base (DKB) of essential components needed for task resolution, while for nDKS, DKB is absent and, hence, a \"global\" or bi-hemispheric search occurs. Based on the latter premise, a 'lie detector' system was designed as described in {{US Patent|6390979|United State Patent No. 6,390,979}}. A pattern of blood-flow-velocity changes is obtained in response to questions that include correct and incorrect answers. The wrong answer will elicit bi-hemispheric activation, from correct answer that activates unilateral response. Cognitive polygraphy based on this system is devoid of any subjective control of mental processes and, hence, high reliability and specificity; however, this is yet to be tested in forensic practice. See also cognitive [[biometrics]].\n\n==ERP==\n{{main|Event-related potentials}}\n[[Event-related potentials]] assess recognition, and therefore may or may not be effective in assessing deception.  In ERP studies P3 amplitude waves are assessed, with these waves being large when an item is recognized.<ref name=Preston />\nHowever, P100 amplitudes have been observed to have significant correlation to trustworthiness ratings, the importance of which will be discussed in the EEG section.  This, along with other studies leads some to purport that because ERP studies rely on quick perceptual processes they \"are integral to the detection of deception.\"<ref name=Heussen />\n\n==EEG==\n{{main|Electroencephalography}}\n[[Electroencephalography]], or EEG, measures brain activity through electrodes attached to the scalp of a subject.  The object is to identify the recognition of meaningful data through this activity.  Images or objects are shown to the subject while questioning techniques are implemented to determine recognition. This can include crime scene images, for example.<ref name=Parliament />\n\nPerceived trustworthiness is interpreted by the individual from looking at a face, and this  decreases when someone is lying.  Such observations are \"too subtle to be explicitly processed by observers, but [do] affect implicit cognitive and affective processes.\"  These results, in a study by Heussen, Binkofski, and Jolij, were obtained through a study with an [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] paradigm including two conditions within the experiment:  truthful faces and lying faces. Faces flashed for 100ms and then the participants rated them. However, the limitations of this study would be that it only had 15 participants and the [[mean]] age was 24.<ref name=Heussen>{{cite journal|last=Heussen|first=Yana|author2=Ferdinand Binkofski |author3=Jacob Jolij |title=The semantics of the lying face \u2013 An EEG Study|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|date=September 2010|volume=77|issue=3|page=206|doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2010.06.006}}</ref>\n\n==Eye-tracking==\nJohn Kircher, Doug Hacker, Anne Cook, Dan Woltz and David Raskin have developed [[Eye tracking|eye-tracking technology]] at the [[University of Utah]] that they consider a polygraph alternative. This is not an emotional reaction like the polygraph and other methods but rather a cognitive reaction.  This technology measures pupil dilation, response time, reading and rereading time, and errors.  Data is recorded while subjects answer true or false questions on a computer.<ref name=Eye-Tracking />\n\nThey have found that more effort is required by lying than giving the truth and thus their aim is to find indications of hard work.  Individuals not telling the truth might, for instance, have dilated pupils while also taking longer to answer the question.<ref name=Eye-Tracking />\n\nEye-tracking offers several benefits over the polygraph: lower cost, 1/5th of the time to conduct, subjects do not need to be \"hooked up\" to anything, and it does not require qualified polygraph examiners to give the test.<ref name=Eye-Tracking />\n\n==Voice stress analysis==\n[[Voice stress analysis]] (also called voice risk analysis) uses computers to compare [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[frequency]], intensity and micro tremors.  In this way voice analysis \"detect[s] minute variations in the voice thought to signal lying.\"  It can even be used covertly over the phone, and has been used by banking and insurance companies as well as the government of the United Kingdom. Customers are assessed for truth in certain situations by banks and insurance companies where computers are used to record responses.  Software then compares control questions to relevant questions assessed for deception. However, its reliability has been debated by peer-reviewed journals.<ref name=Parliament /> \"When a person lies, an involuntary interference of the nerves causes the vocal cords to produce a distorted sound wave, namely a frequency level which is different from the one produced by the same person when telling the truth.\"<ref>S.

The Polygraph and Lie Detection. Committee to review the scientific evidence on the polygraph.\tDivision of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education. Washington, DC: The National Academic Press.</ref>\n\n==FMRI==\n\n=== Future ===\nResearchers have turned to looking for other ways to track deception. The most promising fields are [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]. EEG and fMRI both look to the [[central nervous system]] to compare time and topography of activity in the brain for lie detection. While a polygraph detects changes in activity in the [[peripheral nervous system]], fMRI has the potential to catch the lie at the 'source'. To better understand why fMRI, lie detection is the future of lie detection one must first understand how it works.\n\n=== fMRI ===\nAs Prospects of fMRI as a Lie Detector<ref name=\":1\" />, states fMRIs use electromagnets to create pulse sequences in the cells of the brain. The fMRI scanner then detects the different pulses and fields that are used to distinguish tissue structures and the distinction between layers of the brain, matter type, and the ability to see growths. The functional component allows researchers to see activation in the brain over time and assess efficiency and connectivity by compairing blood use in the brain, which allows for the identification of which portions of the brain are using more oxygen, and thus being used during a specific task. This is called the [[Blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging|Blood Oxygen Level Dependent]] or BOLD hemodynamic response.<ref name=\"Simpson2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Simpson JR|year=2008|title=Functional MRI lie detection: too good to be true?|url=|journal=J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry Law|volume=36|issue=4|pages=491\u2013498|doi=|pmid=19092066}}</ref>. \u00a0fMRI is a correlational machine that looks at both brain structure and activity, yet it does not allow for causal conclusions about brain areas and behaviors or mental processes. \n\n=== Research ===\nTo study deception researchers map the systematic procedure the brain went through to produce the action or decision. Subjects are often offered monetary incentive for their participation. To begin it is important to note areas of the brain that are activated in telling the truth. In an experiment where participants were asked to provide an honest answer based on pre-checked information. \n\n=== Brain Activation ===\nActivation of [[Brodmann area 40|BA 40]], the superior parietal lobe, the lateral left MRG, the striatum, and left thalamus was unique<ref name=\":0\" /> to truth while activation of the [[precuneus]], [[Posterior cingulate cortex|posterior cingulate gyrus]], [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[cerebellum]] will be used to show a similar network for truth and lie<ref name=\":0\" />. The most brain activity occurs in both sides of the prefrontal cortex, which is linked to response inhibition. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. Overall bilateral activation occurs in deception in the [[middle frontal gyrus]], [[Parahippocampal gyrus]], the precuneus, and the cerebellum<ref name=\":0\" />. When looking into the different styles of lying we see differentiation in the locations of activation. Spontaneous lies require retrieval from the semantic and episodic memory to be able to quickly formulate a viable situation that remains in working memory while visual images are created to further hide the truth. The areas associated with this retrieval, the [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[Brodmann area 10|anterior prefrontal cortex]], and precuneus, are activated as well as the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]], and posterior visual cortex are activated. The anterior cingulate cortex is used for cross-checking and probability. For well-rehearsed, memorized, and coherent lies episodic memory activation is needed. This creates increased activation in the right anterior prefrontal cortex, BA 10, and the precuneus. The Parahippocampal cortex may be used in this process to generalize lies to situations because no cross-checking is needed. Newer studies have considered the salience of lying in a variety of situations<ref name=\":0\" />. If a lie is of lower salience activation is broader and general while salient lies have specific activation in regions associated with inhibition and selection<ref>Langleben, D.D., Loughead, J.W., Bilker, W.B., Ruparel, K., Childress, A.R., Busch, S.I. and Gur, R.C. (2005), Telling truth from lie in individual subjects with fast event\u2010related fMRI. Hum. Brain Mapp., 26: 262-272. doi:10.1002/hbm.20191</ref>. Many areas are much more active in lying than truth possibly meaning its harder to retrieve false information compared to true memories<ref name=\":1\" /> because truth has more encoded retrieval cues. Interestingly, the [[limbic system]], which is involved in many different emotional responses including the sympathetic nervous system, is not activated in deception<ref name=\":2\">Commentary: The Future of Forensic Functional Brain Imaging\n\nDaniel D. Langleben, Frank M. Dattilio\n\nJournal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online Dec 2008, 36 (4) 502-504; </ref>. \n\n=== Legality ===\nHistorically, fMRI lie detector tests have not been allowed into evidence in legal proceedings, the most famous attempt being Harvey Nathan\u2019s insurance fraud case<ref name=\":2\" /> in 2007<ref name=\":1\" />. This pushback from the legal system may be based on the 1988 Federal Employment Polygraph Protection Act<ref name=\":2\" /> that acts to protect citizens from incriminating themselves and the right to silence. The legal system specifically would require many more studies on the negative false rate to decide if the absence of deception proves innocence. The lack of legal support has not stopped companies like No Lie MRI and CEPHOS from offering private fMRI scans to test deception. \u00a0\n\n=== Pros and Cons ===\nWhile fMRI studies on deception have claimed detection accuracy as high as 90% many have problems with implementing this style of detection. At a basic level administering, fMRIs is extremely difficult and costly. Only yes or no answers can be used which allows for flexibility<ref name=\":1\" /> in the truth and style of lying. fMRI requires the participant to remain still for long periods and little movements can create issues with the scan<ref name=\":1\" />. Some people are unable to take one such as those with medical conditions, claustrophobia, or implants<ref name=\":1\" />. When looking at deception specifically, there is little research on non-compliant individuals. The criminal justice system interacts with many types of criminals that are not often taken into account in fMRI studies such as addicts, juveniles, mentally unstable, and the elderly<ref name=\":1\" />. Studies have been done on Chinese individuals and their language and cultural differences did not change results, as well as a study (S. Spence 2011) on that 52 schizophrenic patients, 27 of whom were experiencing delusions at the time of the study. While these studies are promising, the lack of extensive research on the populations that would be most affected by fMRIs being admitted into the legal system is a huge drawback. As well, fMRI deception tests look only at changes in activity in the brain which similarly to the polygraph does not show directly that lying is occurring<ref name=\":1\" />. If dealing with complex styles of lying or questions the need for a control condition<ref>Langleben, D.D., Loughead, J.W., Bilker, W.B., Ruparel, K., Childress, A.R., Busch, S.I. and Gur, R.C. (2005), Telling truth from lie in individual subjects with fast event\u2010related fMRI. Hum. Brain Mapp., 26: 262-272. doi:10.1002/hbm.20191</ref> is critical to differentiate from other higher emotional states unrelated to deception. Some studies, such as Ganis et al<ref name=\":1\" />., have shown that it is possible to fool an fMRI by learning countermeasures. \n\n==fNIRS==\n{{main|Functional near-infrared spectroscopy}}\n[[Functional near-infrared spectroscopy]] also detects oxygen and activity in the brain like the fMRI, but instead it looks at blood oxygen levels.  It is advantageous to the fMRI because it is portable, however its image resolution is of lower quality than the fMRI.<ref name=Parliament />\n\n==Brain observations==\n[[Electroencephalography]] is used to detect changes in brain waves.\n\n[[Cognitive chronometry]], or the measurement of the time taken to perform mental operations, can be used to distinguish lying from truth-telling. One recent instrument using cognitive chronometry for this purpose is the [[timed antagonistic response alethiometer]], or TARA.\n\n[[Brain-reading]] uses [[fMRI]] and the multiple voxels activated in the brain evoked by a stimulus to determine what the brain has detected, and so whether it is familiar.\n\n==Nonverbal behavior==\n{{Advert|date=March 2018}}\nPeople often evaluate lies based on non-verbal behavior, but are quick to place too much merit in misleading indicators, such as: avoidance of eye contact, increased pauses between statements, and excessive movements originating from the hands or feet.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akehurst|last2=Koehnken|title=Lay persons' and police officers' beliefs regarding deceptive behavior.|url=|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=10|issue=6|pages=461\u2013471|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0720(199612)10:6<461::aid-acp413>3.3.co;2-u|year=1996}}</ref> Non-invasive lie detection using non-verbal behavior is performed by the [[Silent Talker Lie Detector]].

Most of the collections of the first and second Chabad Rebbe's was lost or destroyed. During Chabad\u2019s third generation, under Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]] (1789\u20131866) known for his major Talmudic-Halachik work, ''Tzemach Tzedek'', a more substantial collection took form.

In fall, 1915, as German forces approached, Rabbi [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn|Sholom Dovber]] and his family were forced to leave Lubavitch. He moved to [[Rostov]], in south Russia. He sent most of his collection to [[Moscow]] for safekeeping, planning to retrieve it after the war. In 1920, however, he died in Rostov, before the end of the [[Russian civil war]] that followed [[World War I]]. As peace gradually returned to the land, his son and successor Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak finally had an opportunity to request the return of the collection. The new Soviet regime, however, nationalized the warehouse and gave the Lubavitch Collection to the [[Russian State Library]]. Only about 100 of the collections volumes had accompanied Rabbi Shalom Dovber and Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak to Rostov\u2014for study or because of sentimental value\u2014and these accompanied Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak on all his later wanderings, to Leningrad, Riga, Warsaw, Otwock, and Brooklyn.

Latin ''veto'' is originally a verb meaning \"I forbid it\" or \"I protest\"; this word was, in addition to its normal uses, in Roman times employed as an interjection by the ''[[tribuni plebis]]'' to protest any measure of the [[Roman Senate]] or the [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]]s, and eventually was also nominalized in reference to its use as an interjection.}}) was a parliamentary device in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the [[Sejm]] (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting, '''Sisto activitatem!''' (Latin: \"I stop the activity!\") or '''Nie pozwalam!''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: \"I do not allow!\"). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The ''liberum veto'' was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive ([[absolute monarchy]]).\n\nMany historians hold that the ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the [[partitions of Poland]] and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland for the next 200 years or so. [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the \"''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy\". In the period of 1573\u20131763, about 150 sejms were held, about a third failing to pass any legislation, mostly because of the ''liberum veto''. The expression ''[[Polish parliament (expression)|Polish parliament]]'' in many European languages originated from the apparent paralysis.\n\n==Origin==\nThe rule evolved from the principle of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/> Each deputy to a [[Sejm]] was elected at a [[sejmik]] (the local ''sejm'' for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/> Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered a violation of the principle of political equality.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/>\n\nAt first, the dissenting deputies were often convinced or cowed back to withdraw their objections.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/> Also, at first, the rule was used to strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed.<ref name=\"Czaplinski-29\"/> For example, as historian [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Czapli\u0144ski]] describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed.<ref name=Czaplinski-29/> From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/>\n\nIt is commonly and erroneously, believed that a Sejm was first disrupted by the ''liberum veto'' by a [[Trakai]] deputy, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sici\u0144ski]], in 1652.<ref name=\"Jasienica\"/> In reality, he vetoed only the continuation of the Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/><ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent.<ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/><ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-117-119\"/> Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted.<ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-117-119\"/> Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the ''liberum veto'' before it had finished its deliberations<ref name=\"bardach223\"/><ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> by the [[Kiev]] deputy, [[Adam Olizar]].<ref name=\"Korzon1898\"/> The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] was elected.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/><ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/>\n\n==Zenith==\nDuring the reign of [[John III Sobieski]] (1674\u20131696), half of Sejm proceedings were scuttled by the veto.<ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> The practice also spread from the national Sejm to local sejmik proceedings.<ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> In the first half of the 18th century, it became increasingly common for Sejm sessions to be broken up by the ''liberum veto'', as the Commonwealth's neighbours, chiefly [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]], found it to be a useful tool to frustrate attempts at reforming and strengthening the Commonwealth. By bribing deputies to exercise their vetoes, Poland's neighbours could derail any measures not to their liking.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/> The Commonwealth deteriorated from a European power into a state of anarchy.<ref name=\"obywatelskiego\"/> Only a few Sejms were able to meet during the reign of the [[House of Saxony]] in Poland (1696\u20131763), the last one in 1736.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/> Only 8 out of the 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1697\u20131733) passed legislation.<ref name=\"Wandycz2001-103-104\"/> For a period of 30 years around the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation (1734\u20131763).<ref name=\"Davies1998\"/> The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term \"Polish anarchy\", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.<ref name=\"Davies1998\"/>\n\nDisruption of the Commonwealth governance caused by the liberum veto was highly significant. From 1573 to 1763, about 150 Sejms where held, of which 53 failed to pass any legislation.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/> Historian [[Jacek J\u0119druch]] notes that out of the 53 disrupted Sejms, 32 were disrupted by the ''liberum veto''.<ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-128\"/>\n\n==Final years==\nThe 18th century saw an institution known as a \"[[confederated sejm]]\" evolve.<ref name=\"bardach\"/> It was a parliament session that operated under the rules of a confederation.<ref name=bardach/> Its primary purpose was to avoid disruption by the ''liberum veto'', unlike the national Sejm, which was being paralyzed by the veto.<ref name=bardach/> On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed of the whole membership of the national Sejm so that the ''liberum veto'' would not operate.<ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-136-138\"/>\n\nThe second half of the 18th century, marking the age of the [[Enlightenment in Poland]], also witnessed an increased trend aiming at the reform of the inefficient governance of the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"bardach284-287\"/><ref name=\"bardach289\"/> Reforms of 1764\u20131766 improved the proceedings of the Sejm.<ref name=\"bardach293-294\"/> Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed.<ref name=\"bardach293-294\"/> The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the ''liberum veto'' and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the [[Cardinal Laws]] of 1768.<ref name=\"bardach297-298\"/><ref name=\"Davies2005-391\"/>\n\nThe ''liberum veto'' was finally abolished by the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], adopted by a confederated sejm, which permanently established the principle of majority rule.<ref name=\"Sanford\"/> The achievements of that constitution, however, which historian [[Norman Davies]] called \"the first constitution of its kind in Europe\",<ref name=\"Europe: A History\"/> were undone by another confederated sejm, meeting at [[Grodno]] in 1793. That Sejm, under duress from Russia and Prussia, ratified the [[Second Partition of Poland]], anticipating the [[Third Partition of Poland]], the final disappearance of the Polish-Lithuanian state just two years later.<ref name=\"Davies2005-405\"/>\n\n==Significance==\nHarvard political scientist [[Grzegorz Ekiert]], assessing the history of the ''liberum veto'' in Poland, concludes:\n: The principle of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened the role of the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.<ref>Grzegorz Ekiert, \u201cVeto, Liberum,\u201d in  Seymour Martin Lipset, ed. \u2018\u2019The Encyclopedia of Democracy\u2019\u2019 (1998) 4:1341</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist [[Dalibor Roh\u00e1\u010d]] noted that the \"principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of [[constitutionalism]]\" and acted as a significant constraint on the powers of the monarch by making the \"rule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism.\"<ref name=\"Rohac2008\"/> It was seen as one of the key principles of the Commonwealth political system and culture, the [[Golden Liberty]].<ref name=\"bardach248-249\"/>\n\nAt the same time, historians hold that the principle of ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system and Commonwealth's eventual downfall.<ref name=Jasienica/> Deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of \"Golden Age\", for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth's government, stemming any attempts at reform.<ref name=\"BullittSempa2005\"/><ref name=\"AdamsCarey2000\"/> [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the \"''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy.\"<ref name=\"Wandycz1980\"/> Wagner echoed him thus: \"Certainly, there was no other institution of old Poland which has been more sharply criticized in more recent times than this one.\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=W.J.|title=May 3, 1791, and the Polish constitutional tradition|journal=The Polish Review|date=1992|volume=36|issue=4|pages=383\u2013395|jstor=25778591}}</ref>\n\n==Modern parallels and popular culture==\n\n=== References in popular culture ===\nA 2004 Polish [[collectible card game]], ''[[Veto (game)|Veto]]'', set in the background of a [[royal election in Poland|royal election]] during an [[general sejm|election sejm]], is named after this procedure.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek\"/>\n\n=== Modern parallels ===\nUntil the early 1990s, [[IBM]] had a decision-making process called \"non-concur\" in which any department head could veto a company-wide strategy if it did not fit in with their own department's outlook, the disagreements being then sent to the superiors in the hierarchy, often taking several months.

Latin ''veto'' is originally a verb meaning \"I forbid it\" or \"I protest\"; this word was, in addition to its normal uses, in Roman times employed as an interjection by the ''[[tribuni plebis]]'' to protest any measure of the [[Roman Senate]] or the [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]]s, and eventually was also nominalized in reference to its use as an interjection.}}) was a parliamentary device in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the [[Sejm]] (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting, '''Sisto activitatem!''' (Latin: \"I stop the activity!\") or '''Nie pozwalam!''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: \"I do not allow!\"). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The ''liberum veto'' was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive ([[absolute monarchy]]).\n\nMany historians hold that the ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the [[partitions of Poland]] and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland for the next 200 years or so. [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the \"''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy\". In the period of 1573\u20131763, about 150 sejms were held, about a third failing to pass any legislation, mostly because of the ''liberum veto''. The expression ''[[Polish parliament (expression)|Polish parliament]]'' in many European languages originated from the apparent paralysis.\n\n==Origin==\nThe rule evolved from the principle of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/> Each deputy to a [[Sejm]] was elected at a [[sejmik]] (the local ''sejm'' for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/> Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered a violation of the principle of political equality.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/>\n\nAt first, the dissenting deputies were often convinced or cowed back to withdraw their objections.<ref name=\"bardach220-221\"/> Also, at first, the rule was used to strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed.<ref name=\"Czaplinski-29\"/> For example, as historian [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Czapli\u0144ski]] describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed.<ref name=Czaplinski-29/> From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/>\n\nIt is commonly and erroneously, believed that a Sejm was first disrupted by the ''liberum veto'' by a [[Trakai]] deputy, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sici\u0144ski]], in 1652.<ref name=\"Jasienica\"/> In reality, he vetoed only the continuation of the Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/><ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent.<ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/><ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-117-119\"/> Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted.<ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-117-119\"/> Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the ''liberum veto'' before it had finished its deliberations<ref name=\"bardach223\"/><ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> by the [[Kiev]] deputy, [[Adam Olizar]].<ref name=\"Korzon1898\"/> The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] was elected.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/><ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/>\n\n==Zenith==\nDuring the reign of [[John III Sobieski]] (1674\u20131696), half of Sejm proceedings were scuttled by the veto.<ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> The practice also spread from the national Sejm to local sejmik proceedings.<ref name=\"Carsten1961\"/> In the first half of the 18th century, it became increasingly common for Sejm sessions to be broken up by the ''liberum veto'', as the Commonwealth's neighbours, chiefly [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]], found it to be a useful tool to frustrate attempts at reforming and strengthening the Commonwealth. By bribing deputies to exercise their vetoes, Poland's neighbours could derail any measures not to their liking.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/> The Commonwealth deteriorated from a European power into a state of anarchy.<ref name=\"obywatelskiego\"/> Only a few Sejms were able to meet during the reign of the [[House of Saxony]] in Poland (1696\u20131763), the last one in 1736.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/> Only 8 out of the 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1697\u20131733) passed legislation.<ref name=\"Wandycz2001-103-104\"/> For a period of 30 years around the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation (1734\u20131763).<ref name=\"Davies1998\"/> The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term \"Polish anarchy\", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.<ref name=\"Davies1998\"/>\n\nDisruption of the Commonwealth governance caused by the liberum veto was highly significant. From 1573 to 1763, about 150 Sejms where held, of which 53 failed to pass any legislation.<ref name=\"bardach223\"/> Historian [[Jacek J\u0119druch]] notes that out of the 53 disrupted Sejms, 32 were disrupted by the ''liberum veto''.<ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-128\"/>\n\n==Final years==\nThe 18th century saw an institution known as a \"[[confederated sejm]]\" evolve.<ref name=\"bardach\"/> It was a parliament session that operated under the rules of a confederation.<ref name=bardach/> Its primary purpose was to avoid disruption by the ''liberum veto'', unlike the national Sejm, which was being paralyzed by the veto.<ref name=bardach/> On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed of the whole membership of the national Sejm so that the ''liberum veto'' would not operate.<ref name=\"J\u0119druch1982-136-138\"/>\n\nThe second half of the 18th century, marking the age of the [[Enlightenment in Poland]], also witnessed an increased trend aiming at the reform of the inefficient governance of the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"bardach284-287\"/><ref name=\"bardach289\"/> Reforms of 1764\u20131766 improved the proceedings of the Sejm.<ref name=\"bardach293-294\"/> Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed.<ref name=\"bardach293-294\"/> The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the ''liberum veto'' and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the [[Cardinal Laws]] of 1768.<ref name=\"bardach297-298\"/><ref name=\"Davies2005-391\"/>\n\nThe ''liberum veto'' was finally abolished by the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], adopted by a confederated sejm, which permanently established the principle of majority rule.<ref name=\"Sanford\"/> The achievements of that constitution, however, which historian [[Norman Davies]] called \"the first constitution of its kind in Europe\",<ref name=\"Europe: A History\"/> were undone by another confederated sejm, meeting at [[Grodno]] in 1793. That Sejm, under duress from Russia and Prussia, ratified the [[Second Partition of Poland]], anticipating the [[Third Partition of Poland]], the final disappearance of the Polish-Lithuanian state just two years later.<ref name=\"Davies2005-405\"/>\n\n==Significance==\nHarvard political scientist [[Grzegorz Ekiert]], assessing the history of the ''liberum veto'' in Poland, concludes:\n: The principle of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened the role of the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.<ref>Grzegorz Ekiert, \u201cVeto, Liberum,\u201d in  Seymour Martin Lipset, ed. \u2018\u2019The Encyclopedia of Democracy\u2019\u2019 (1998) 4:1341</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist [[Dalibor Roh\u00e1\u010d]] noted that the \"principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of [[constitutionalism]]\" and acted as a significant constraint on the powers of the monarch by making the \"rule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism.\"<ref name=\"Rohac2008\"/> It was seen as one of the key principles of the Commonwealth political system and culture, the [[Golden Liberty]].<ref name=\"bardach248-249\"/>\n\nAt the same time, historians hold that the principle of ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system and Commonwealth's eventual downfall.<ref name=Jasienica/> Deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of \"Golden Age\", for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth's government, stemming any attempts at reform.<ref name=\"BullittSempa2005\"/><ref name=\"AdamsCarey2000\"/> [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the \"''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy.\"<ref name=\"Wandycz1980\"/> Wagner echoed him thus: \"Certainly, there was no other institution of old Poland which has been more sharply criticized in more recent times than this one.\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=W.J.|title=May 3, 1791, and the Polish constitutional tradition|journal=The Polish Review|date=1992|volume=36|issue=4|pages=383\u2013395|jstor=25778591}}</ref>\n\n==Modern parallels and popular culture==\n\n=== References in popular culture ===\nA 2004 Polish [[collectible card game]], ''[[Veto (game)|Veto]]'', set in the background of a [[royal election in Poland|royal election]] during an [[general sejm|election sejm]], is named after this procedure.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek\"/>\n\n=== Modern parallels ===\nUntil the early 1990s, [[IBM]] had a decision-making process called \"non-concur\" in which any department head could veto a company-wide strategy if it did not fit in with their own department's outlook, the disagreements being then sent to the superiors in the hierarchy, often taking several months.
