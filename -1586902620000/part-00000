In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref name=\"bbc turner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat.

In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]]. After stopping in [[Lim\u00f3n]], [[Costa Rica]] to work in a farm with the [[Bribri people|Bribri tribe]], they arrived at the checkpoint in [[Panama City]] first on Day 14 of the race.\n\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon & Jamiul took the faster [[Pan-American Highway#Central America|CA1 route]] via [[San Salvador]] in a attempt to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]]. They overtook Jen & Rob, who took a break in [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] and were the last team to arrive at Panama City. \n\nIn Honduras, after buying food at a stop, Michael found that he had lost his money belt containing \u00a31,155, which is more than half their money at the start of the leg.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/sydenham-and-lewisham-couple-testing-their-relationship-by-racing-the-length-of-south-america/ |title=Sydenham and Lewisham couple testing their relationship by racing the length of South America |first=Toby |last=Porter|date= 16 March 2020 |work= London News Online}}</ref> Even though they tried to earn some money at the [[Ballena National Marine Park]], at the end of the leg, Shuntelle & Michael decided to quit the race as they felt they could no longer compete with so little money left.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Pe\u00f1as Blancas District|Pe\u00f1as Blancas]] \u2192 [[Lim\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|\u2014\n|74%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 El Cuco [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|2.5\n|75%\n|-style=background:#ccf\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Shuntelle & Michael{{ref|1|[a]}}\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Comayagua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] \u2192 [[Ballena National Marine Park]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|4.5\n|14%\n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[David, Panama|David]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|20\n|60%\n|-\n|5\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Monteverde, Costa Rica|Monteverde]] / [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|21.5\n|74%\n|-\n|}\n<small>{{note|1|Note a}} Shuntelle & Michael withdrew from the race after losing over a thousand pounds.</small>\n\n====Leg 3: Panama City \u2192 Villavieja ====\n[[File:Villavieja, Huila, desierto Tatacoa - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Tatacoa Desert]]]]\nThe original destination was to be [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]; however, due to [[2019 Ecuadorian protests|civil unrest]], the checkpoint was moved to the Bethel Hotel near [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] of [[Colombia]].  To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1. However, this detour cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ustupo]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| \u2014\n| 44%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Magdalena River]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|2.5\n| 57%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cali]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|9.5\n| 54%\n|-\n| 4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Guatap\u00e9]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| 12\n| 53%\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 4: Villavieja \u2192 Puno ====\n[[File:095 Hotel Puno Peru 3366 (15119509256).jpg|thumb|Hotel in [[Puno]]]]\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador, for safety reasons the teams were not allowed to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]] in [[Peru]] to continue the race.  The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nBoth Jo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] before travelling to their destination in [[Puno]], which depleted their funds. However, as they did not stop to work along the way, Jo & Sam reached the checkpoint first, which is located on an island connected to the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] at Puno.\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled in a slower but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them to the second spot at the checkpoint on Day 27. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco.

The long journey also depleted the funds for all the teams. \n\nAll teams except Dom & Lizzie needed to go to Salta to catch a bus to the border.  Both Emon & Jamiul and Jen & Rob chose a shorter route via [[Paraguay]]. Emon & Jamiul stopped at [[Asunci\u00f3n]] to work in a [[retirement home]]. Jen & Rob went to see the [[Iguazu Falls]], and they also took a longer detour for a break at [[Blumenau]], which delayed their journey further.

Although Dom & Lizzie were the last to leave, at the Cafayete bus station, they were informed by a local that there is a direct bus route to [[Corrientes]], which allowed them to catch up with Jo & Sam at Corrientes who had to stay overnight at Salta. Both teams decided to share a mini-van ride to the border with Brazil to avoid further delay. \n\nJo & Sam went to Praia do Rosa where they worked for bed and board, as well as a chance for Sam learning to surf.  \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul \n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Salta]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Formosa, Argentina|Formosa]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Asunci\u00f3n]]  [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]]  \u2192 [[Foz do Igua\u00e7u]] \u2192 [[S\u00e3o Paolo]] \u2192 [[Angra dos Reis]] \u2192  [[Ilha Grande]]\n| \u2014\n| \n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Salta]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Clorinda, Formosa|Clorinda]]  \u2192 [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[San Antonio, Paraguay|San Antonio]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Asunci\u00f3n]] \u2192 [[Iguazu Falls]]  [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]]  \u2192 [[Blumenau]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]]  \u2192 [[Rio de Janeiro]] \u2192 Concei\u00e7\u00e3o de Jacare\u00ed \u2192 [[Ilha Grande]]\n| 6\n| \n|-\n|\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Corrientes]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Florian\u00f3polis]][[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Sao Paolo]] \u2192 [[Angra dos Reis]]\n|\n| \n|-\n|\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Salta]] \u2192 [[Corrientes]] \u2192 Praia do Rosa [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Florian\u00f3polis]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Sao Paolo]] \u2192 [[Angra dos Reis]]  \n| \n| \n|-\n|}\n\n===Ratings===\nThe first episode had an overnight rating of 1.9 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/channel-overview/bbc2s-race-starts-well/5148120.article |title=BBC2\u2019s Race starts well\n|date=13 March 2020 |work=Broadcast Now}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' found the first series \"fiendishly addictive\", and thought that it \"reaffirmed one's faith in human nature\" where friendships are \"formed across cultural divides\", with the series ending on an act of kindness that was \"apt\" and \"heartwarming\".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/race-across-world-finale-review-tension-breakdowns-locusts-breakfast/ |title=Race Across the World, finale, review: tension, breakdowns, locusts for breakfast \u2013 and a heartwarming end |first=Michael|last= Hogan|date=7 April 2019 |work=The Telegraph }}</ref> Jeff Robson of the ''[[i (newspaper)|i]]'' newspaper regarded the series  \"flawed but engaging\", and that although the show lacked the \"challenges of some extreme travelogues, nor the sense of peril\", it \"succeeded in recreating the combination of unexpected highlights, soul-destroying lows and crucial budget decisions which characterised old-school seat of the pants travel\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/race-across-the-world-bbc2-review-92362 |title=Race Across The World, BBC2, review: a flawed but engaging travelogue with a difference|first=Jeff |last=Robson|date= 3 March 2019|work=iNews }}</ref>  Carol Midgley of ''[[The Times]]'' on the other hand regarded the challenge of racing to be \"quite tough\" and \"dramatic\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tv-review-race-across-the-world-call-the-midwife-mf0hzx2sv |title=TV review: Race Across the World; Call the Midwife|first=Carol |last=Midgley |date=4 March 2019 |work=The Times}}</ref> \n\nIn the second series, Joel Golby of ''[[The Guardian]]'' judged it \"an astounding piece of TV\" that \"captures all the vibrant highs and exhausted lows of travel in all of their raw glory\", and one that made him \"genuinely caring how this one ends and the impact it will have on the lives of those who lived it\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world |title=Race Across the World: a competitive gap year you end up caring about |first=Joel|last= Golby|date=21 March 2020|work=The Guardian }}</ref>  Anita Singh of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' thought \"the casting is one of the strengths of the series\" and she \"can't help but warm to these wacky racers\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2020/03/08/race-across-world-review-cant-help-warm-wacky-racers/ |title= Race Across the World, review: I can't help but warm to these wacky racers |first=Anita |last=Singh |date=8 March 2020 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> However, Chris Moss of the same paper was more negative; he found that the obstacles the contestants faced were \"largely fictive\" and the tension \"fabricated\", and thought the show used the \"old idiot abroad trope\", and the viewers were \"asked not to marvel at faraway places but to engage with the participants\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/south-america/articles/perfect-journey-latin-america/ |title=What Race Across the World gets wrong about Latin America and modern travel |first=Chris |last=Moss|date=16 March 2020 |work=The Telegraph }}</ref> Equally negative was Barry Didcock of ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' who considered the show's premise of travelling without flying \"a frivolous exercise\" and of questionable taste as the budget of racers would exceed that of a refugee at the Mexico-Guatemala border.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/18305947.barry-didcocks-tv-review-race-across-world-bbc-two-sunday/ |title=Barry Didcock's TV review: Race Across The World, BBC Two, Sunday |first= Barry |last=Didcock }}</ref> In contrast, Shaun Kitchener wrote in ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' that the show \"is the heartfelt light we all need in these dark times\" as it was aired during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref name=\"bbc turner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas.

Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]].

To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1.

The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nBoth Jo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] before travelling to their destination in [[Puno]], which depleted their funds. However, as they did not stop to work along the way, Jo & Sam reached the checkpoint first, which is located on an island connected to the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] at Puno.\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled in a slower but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them to the second spot at the checkpoint on Day 27. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco.

The long journey also depleted the funds for all the teams. \n\nAll teams except Dom & Lizzie needed to go to Salta to catch a bus to the border.  Both Emon & Jamiul and Jen & Rob chose a shorter route via [[Paraguay]]. Emon & Jamiul stopped at [[Asunci\u00f3n]] to work in a [[retirement home]]. Jen & Rob went to see the [[Iguazu Falls]], and they also took a longer detour for a break at [[Blumenau]], which delayed their journey further. They finished second to Emon & Jamiul. \n\nBoth Jo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie went on a longer route from Argentina to Brazil travelling up along the Atlantic coast. Although Dom & Lizzie were the last to leave, at the Cafayete bus station, they were informed by a local that there is a direct bus route to [[Corrientes]], which allowed them to catch up with Jo & Sam at Corrientes who had to stay overnight at Salta. Both teams decided to share a mini-van ride to the border with Brazil to avoid further delay. \n\nJo & Sam went to Praia do Rosa where they worked for bed and board, as well as a chance for Sam learning to surf.  \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul \n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Salta]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Formosa, Argentina|Formosa]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Asunci\u00f3n]]  [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]]  \u2192 [[Foz do Igua\u00e7u]] \u2192 [[Sao Paolo]] \u2192 [[Angra dos Reis]] \u2192  [[Ilha Grande]]\n| \u2014\n| \n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Salta]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Clorinda, Formosa|Clorinda]]  \u2192 [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[San Antonio, Paraguay|San Antonio]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Asunci\u00f3n]] \u2192 [[Iguazu Falls]]  [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]]  \u2192 [[Blumenau]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]]  \u2192 [[Rio de Janeiro]] \u2192 Concei\u00e7\u00e3o de Jacare\u00ed \u2192 [[Ilha Grande]]\n| 6\n| \n|-\n|\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Corrientes]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Florian\u00f3polis]][[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Sao Paolo]] \u2192 [[Angra dos Reis]]\n|\n| \n|-\n|\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Salta]] \u2192 [[Corrientes]] \u2192 Praia do Rosa [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Florian\u00f3polis]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Sao Paolo]] \u2192 [[Angra dos Reis]]  \n| \n| \n|-\n|}\n\n===Ratings===\nThe first episode had an overnight rating of 1.9 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/channel-overview/bbc2s-race-starts-well/5148120.article |title=BBC2\u2019s Race starts well\n|date=13 March 2020 |work=Broadcast Now}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Several weeks later, the song appeared on the [[Losing My Religion (Grey's Anatomy)|second-season finale]] of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' on 15 May 2006, and the song found a larger listening audience and pushed its way onto the download and pop charts in the United States. The song was made into a music video for the show, serving as a promotion for its third season. The music video shows scenes from the first and second seasons as well as previously unseen scenes from the third season, with clips in-between from the UK music video of the song.

The video failed to catch on, regardless, so a third version was filmed for the edited single version of the song. On 13 September 2006, the song soared in the digital music charts to become the most-downloaded song in the U.S. [[iTunes Store]], just one day after the DVD release of the second season of ''Grey's Anatomy''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The song was used in ''Verbotene Liebe'', a German soap opera.\n\nThe song was released as a download-only single on 17 July 2006 and entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the week ending 29 July at number 25 on the strength of download sales alone. Its physical release on 24 July pushed the song up to number 15, peaking six weeks later at number 6. However, seven weeks after that, in November the CD single was deleted and, under the chart rules prevailing at that time, the song was removed from the chart two weeks after that, having clocked up 17 weeks in total. It was then absent from the chart for seven weeks, but in January 2007, a change to the chart rules meant that all downloads, with or without a physical equivalent, were now eligible to chart. \"Chasing Cars\" duly surged back in at a top 10 position (number 9, just three places below its peak), and remained on the chart for 48 consecutive weeks, entirely on downloads, only falling out again in December. After a three-week absence, in January 2008 it was back again, for 13 weeks this time, peaking at No. 50. It then bowed out for a third time, re-entered the top 75 in June, August, October and November 2008, November 2009, January and December 2010, and March, July and December 2011, and re-entered again on 24 August 2013, charting at No. 66 before climbing up to No. 60 the following week, and up to No. 47 the week after, now taking the song's tally up to 111 weeks on the UK Top 75, making it the 2nd longest runner of all time, bettered only by [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\" (124 weeks).

The song was also performed as the last live performance on long-running music programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The band also performed the song when they were the musical guest on 17 March 2007 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]. Additionally, the band played the song live in their appearance at [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth]]; on 7 July 2007, this song was performed during the London leg of the Live Earth concert at [[Wembley Stadium]] and at [[Oxegen]] later on that night in Ireland.\n\n\"Chasing Cars\" was heard on the TV show [[One Tree Hill (TV series)|''One Tree Hill'']]'s third-season finale episode, \"The Show Must Go On\", which aired in the US on 3 May 2006. Several weeks later, the song appeared on the [[Losing My Religion (Grey's Anatomy)|second-season finale]] of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' on 15 May 2006, and the song found a larger listening audience and pushed its way onto the download and pop charts in the United States. The song was made into a music video for the show, serving as a promotion for its third season. The music video shows scenes from the first and second seasons as well as previously unseen scenes from the third season, with clips in-between from the UK music video of the song. It was heard again in the [[Song Beneath the Song|eighteenth episode]] of the show's seventh season on 31 March 2011, along with the cast's cover of [[Brandi Carlile|Brandi Carlile's]] \"[[The Story (song)|The Story]]\" and [[The Fray|The Fray's]] \"[[How to Save a Life (song)|How to Save a Life]]\".\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:ChasingCarsmusicvideoscreenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|The US music video, where [[Gary Lightbody]] sings while lying on the ground]]\nTwo music videos were made; one for the UK and one for the US.\n\nIn the UK music video, [[Gary Lightbody]] lies on the open ground as cameras film him from different angles. It starts raining, splashing his face and hands. Lightbody enters a pool of water next to him and, at the end of the video, he gets out of the water, rises to his feet and looks up at the camera as it zooms out overhead.\n\nIn the US music video, Lightbody is shown lying down in busy places while singing. People ignore him and step over him. Among the places he lies are a diner, an intersection, the top of an escalator, a subway car, the top of a hill overlooking the [[Golden State Freeway]] and, at the end, a bed.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's Sven Phillip found \"Chasing Cars\" to be the only song on ''Eyes Open'' which was \"not to be missed\".

The video failed to catch on, regardless, so a third version was filmed for the edited single version of the song. On 13 September 2006, the song soared in the digital music charts to become the most-downloaded song in the U.S. [[iTunes Store]], just one day after the DVD release of the second season of ''Grey's Anatomy''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The song was used in ''Verbotene Liebe'', a German soap opera.\n\nThe song was released as a download-only single on 17 July 2006 and entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the week ending 29 July at number 25 on the strength of download sales alone. Its physical release on 24 July pushed the song up to number 15, peaking six weeks later at number 6. However, seven weeks after that, in November the CD single was deleted and, under the chart rules prevailing at that time, the song was removed from the chart two weeks after that, having clocked up 17 weeks in total. It was then absent from the chart for seven weeks, but in January 2007, a change to the chart rules meant that all downloads, with or without a physical equivalent, were now eligible to chart. \"Chasing Cars\" duly surged back in at a top 10 position (number 9, just three places below its peak), and remained on the chart for 48 consecutive weeks, entirely on downloads, only falling out again in December. After a three-week absence, in January 2008 it was back again, for 13 weeks this time, peaking at No. 50. It then bowed out for a third time, re-entered the top 75 in June, August, October and November 2008, November 2009, January and December 2010, and March, July and December 2011, and re-entered again on 24 August 2013, charting at No. 66 before climbing up to No. 60 the following week, and up to No. 47 the week after, now taking the song's tally up to 111 weeks on the UK Top 75, making it the 2nd longest runner of all time, bettered only by [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\" (124 weeks). Only for 14 weeks out of those 111 was a physical copy of \"Chasing Cars\" officially available.
