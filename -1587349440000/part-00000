This wooden artifact was made in Park Ridge by the Campbell Brothers who invented a way to drill through long pieces of hair pipe shells so that they could be strung and worn as breast plates by the Plains Indians, among others. Needing water for the operation, the industrious brothers leased a woolen mill that stood on the Pascack Brook. When that burned down they built their own mill farther down Pascack Creek on their land another shop on Pascack Road near their homestead. Both building housed drilling machines on their second floors where they were safe from prying eyes, as the two machines had not been patented. In the early 19th century, John Jacob Astor purchased wampum from the Campbells to trade with the Native Americans of the [[Pacific Northwest]] whose beaver pelts he turned into men's hats.<ref>[http://www.wampumworks.com/history2.html A Chronology of the Rise, Fall &ndash; and Resurrection of Wampum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040117185447/http://www.wampumworks.com/history2.html |date=2004-01-17 }}, accessed December 21, 2006.</ref>  The best years for the wampum business were between 1835 and 1866.

This wooden artifact was made in Park Ridge by the Campbell Brothers who invented a way to drill through long pieces of hair pipe shells so that they could be strung and worn as breast plates by the Plains Indians, among others. Needing water for the operation, the industrious brothers leased a woolen mill that stood on the Pascack Brook. When that burned down they built their own mill farther down Pascack Creek on their land another shop on Pascack Road near their homestead. Both building housed drilling machines on their second floors where they were safe from prying eyes, as the two machines had not been patented. In the early 19th century, John Jacob Astor purchased wampum from the Campbells to trade with the Native Americans of the [[Pacific Northwest]] whose beaver pelts he turned into men's hats.<ref>[http://www.wampumworks.com/history2.html A Chronology of the Rise, Fall &ndash; and Resurrection of Wampum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040117185447/http://www.wampumworks.com/history2.html |date=2004-01-17 }}, accessed December 21, 2006.</ref>  The best years for the wampum business were between 1835 and 1866.

The group publishes four daily newspapers, around 50 weekly newspapers, and 80 consumer and contract magazines.\n\nArchant employs around 1,250 employees, mainly in [[East Anglia]], the [[Home counties]] and the [[West Country]], and was known as '''Eastern Counties Newspapers Group''' until March 2002.\n\n==History==\n\n===1845 to 1900===\nThe company began publishing in Norwich in 1845 with ''Norfolk News'', backed by Jacob Henry Tillet, [[Jeremiah Colman]], John Copeman and Thomas Jarrold. The Colman and Copeman families still retain close involvement in the business.\n\nThe ''Eastern Weekly Press'' was launched in 1867 and in 1870 was renamed the ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]''. A sister title, the ''[[Norwich Evening News|Eastern Evening News]]'', was launched in 1882.\n\n===1900 to 2000===\nAs the business grew it moved premises in 1902, 1959 and again in the late 1960s to its present headquarters location at Prospect House in the centre of Norwich.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, Eastern Counties Newspapers merged with the East Anglian Daily Times Company, publisher of the ''[[East Anglian Daily Times]]'', to form Eastern Counties Newspapers Group (ECNG).\n\nECNG developed further with the launch of Community Media Limited in 1981, a weeklies publishing operation based in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], which launched and acquired titles in [[Scotland]] and the West Country.\n\nIn 1985, ECNG purchased the East Anglia-based ''Advertiser'' group of weekly free newspapers. These businesses operated as separate entities until the mid-1990s when they were brought together under the ECNG banner.\n\nECNG acquired four weekly newspapers in [[Huntingdon]], [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Wisbech]] and [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]] from Thomson in 1993. The acquisition of Peterhead-based P Scrogie followed shortly afterwards.\n\nIn 1995 the company opened a new 25m Print Center in Thorpe, Norwich, with Goss HT70 Presses and Muller-Martini Mailroom Equipment, Replacing the Goss Metro Presses at Prospect House.\n\nThe company moved into Internet publishing in 1996 when it launched '''Eastern Counties Network''', a Web-based service using copy from its four daily newspapers as well as original material. Later this was disaggregated into separate websites for each of the newspapers.\n\nIn April 1998, ECNG bought Home Counties Newspapers Holdings plc with an agreed bid of approximately \u00a358&nbsp;million. The bid earned the company the nickname of \"The [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corp.]] of East Anglia\". HCNH published a range of 26 weekly paid and free titles across [[Greater London]] and the Home Counties. The title portfolio included the ''Hampstead & Highgate Express'', the ''[[South Essex Recorder]]'' series, the ''[[Herts Advertiser]]'' series, the ''Comet'' series, the ''Herald'' group and the ''[[Welwyn Hatfield|Welwyn & Hatfield Times]]''.\n\nConsumer magazine publisher Market Link Publishing, now '''Archant Specialist''', based in [[Essex]] was acquired by ECNG for \u00a35&nbsp;million in autumn 1999.

It is also commonly referred to as the '''Australian Government''', the '''Commonwealth Government''', or the '''Federal Government'''.\n\nThe legislature, also known as the Parliament of Australia, or simply Parliament, is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia.\n\nThese representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation. The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers:\nthe House of Representatives (or 'the lower house') and the Senate (or 'the upper house'). The lower House is green and the senate is red. This 2 house system is called the bicameral system meaning 2 houses.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 151 members, each representing a different area of the country ('electorate'). Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary, meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 76 members. Unlike the House of Representatives, membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states. Each state has 12 senators, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each. The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the role of political parties in Parliament. It does not make any reference to a government party, an opposition party or minor parties, or to roles like Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. These are conventions that have been adopted to assist the smooth operation of the legislature.\n\nThe executive is the administrative arm of government. The Australian Government is formed by the party or coalition of parties with the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives.\n\nA government minister is a member of the legislature who has been chosen to also work as part of the executive, usually with responsibility for matters on a specific topic (his/her portfolio). The main roles of the Government are to make important national decisions, develop policy, introduce bills (proposed laws), implement laws and manage government departments.\n\nThe public service, working in departments and agencies, puts those laws into operation and upholds those laws once they have begun to operate. Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory, is Australia's national capital. The Parliament of Australia is located in Canberra, as is most of the Australian Government public service.\n\nThe judiciary is the legal arm of the government. Independent of the legislature and the executive, it is the role of the judiciary to enforce Australia's laws. It must also ensure that the other arms of government do not act beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution or by Parliament.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is, as its name suggests, Australia's highest court. Underneath the High Court are a number of other federal courts. The [[Commonwealth]] of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing [[British Empire|British colonies]], which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which was drawn up at a [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] and ratified by the people of the colonies at [[referendum]]s. The Australian [[head of state]] is the [[Queen of Australia]] who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| last=House of Representatives| title=The Australian System of Government| page=3| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=10 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124621/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| archivedate=12 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |website =Parliamentary Education Office |title=History and Culture: Quick Answers |publisher =Australian Government Publishing Service |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313181036/https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/protocol/protocol_guidelines/15.html| last=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade| authorlink=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)| title=Protocol > Protocol guidelines > The Australian Government| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| last=Australian Public Service Commission| authorlink=Australian Public Service Commission| title=About the Commission > The Australian experience of public sector reform > The Constitutional and Government framework| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313221139/http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| archivedate=13 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/_pdf/australian-citizenship-aug2012.pdf|title=Australian Citizenship \u2013 Our Common Bond|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|date=August 2012}}</ref> with executive powers delegated by [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional convention]] to the Australian [[head of government]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].\n\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into three branches: the executive branch, composed of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the [[Cabinet of Australia]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, composed of the [[Parliament of Australia]]'s [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]] branch, composed of the [[High Court of Australia]] and the [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. [[Separation of powers]] is implied by the structure of the Constitution, the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters (chapters I to III).The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the [[Westminster system|United Kingdom]] ([[Fusion of powers|fused executive]], [[constitutional monarchy]]) and the [[United States Government|United States]] ([[federalism]], [[written constitution]], elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features, and has therefore been characterised as a \"Washminster mutation\".<ref>{{cite article|last=Thompson|first=Elaine|title=The \"Washminster\" Mutation|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=15|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Images of branches of Australian Government}}\n\nSection 1 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] creates a democratic legislature, the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] which consists of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], and two houses of parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51]] of the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as \"heads of power\") to the Commonwealth government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|States]] (previously separate colonies). Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This \"transfer\" legislation may have a \"sunset clause\", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.\n\nIn addition, Australia has several \"territories\", two of which are self-governing:  the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT).  These territories' legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth;  the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The territory of [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never  represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament.  The other territories that are regularly inhabited{{mdash}}[[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]{{mdash}}have never been self-governing.\n\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators.\n\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is [[Local government in Australia|Local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the State), usually serving part-time.  Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located.\n\nGovernment at the Commonwealth level and the State/Territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\n\n* Legislature: The [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]]\n* Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments\n* Judiciary: The [[High Court of Australia]] and subsidiary Federal courts.\n\n''[[Separation of powers]]'' is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other:\n\n* the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms;  the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent\n* the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation\n* the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both [[statute law]] and the [[common law]];  the Australian courts cannot give an [[advisory opinions|advisory opinion]] on the constitutionality of a law, but the [[High Court of Australia]] can determine whether an existing law is constitutional\n* the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth  or State/Territory government;  but the Legislature and the Executive should  not try to influence its decisions.\n\n==Legislature==\n{{main|Parliament of Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nTwelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as \"quota-preferential voting\": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia}}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.\n\nThe day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].\n\n==Executive==\n\n===Head of state===\n{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term \"head of state\". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>\n[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]\nThe [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of Australia, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is also the Sovereign of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s including the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.\n\nSection 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.\n\nUnder the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\n\nAustralia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].\n\n{{further|Constitutional history of Australia|Australian republicanism|Australian head of state dispute}}\n\n===Executive Council===\n{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}\nThe Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"[[The Honourable]]\", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].\n\nThere are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|\"caretaker\" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Australia|List of Australian Ministers}}\n\nThe Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.\n\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.\n\nWhen the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.\n\nWhen the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>\n\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne.

It is also commonly referred to as the '''Australian Government''', the '''Commonwealth Government''', or the '''Federal Government'''.\n\nThe legislature, also known as the Parliament of Australia, or simply Parliament, is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia.\n\nThese representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation. The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers:\nthe House of Representatives (or 'the lower house') and the Senate (or 'the upper house'). The lower House is green and the senate is red. This 2 house system is called the bicameral system meaning 2 houses.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 151 members, each representing a different area of the country ('electorate'). Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary, meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 76 members. Unlike the House of Representatives, membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states. Each state has 12 senators, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each. The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the role of political parties in Parliament. It does not make any reference to a government party, an opposition party or minor parties, or to roles like Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. These are conventions that have been adopted to assist the smooth operation of the legislature.\n\nThe executive is the administrative arm of government. The Australian Government is formed by the party or coalition of parties with the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives.\n\nA government minister is a member of the legislature who has been chosen to also work as part of the executive, usually with responsibility for matters on a specific topic (his/her portfolio). The main roles of the Government are to make important national decisions, develop policy, introduce bills (proposed laws), implement laws and manage government departments.\n\nThe public service, working in departments and agencies, puts those laws into operation and upholds those laws once they have begun to operate. Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory, is Australia's national capital. The Parliament of Australia is located in Canberra, as is most of the Australian Government public service.\n\nThe judiciary is the legal arm of the government. Independent of the legislature and the executive, it is the role of the judiciary to enforce Australia's laws. It must also ensure that the other arms of government do not act beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution or by Parliament.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is, as its name suggests, Australia's highest court. Underneath the High Court are a number of other federal courts. The [[Commonwealth]] of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing [[British Empire|British colonies]], which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which was drawn up at a [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] and ratified by the people of the colonies at [[referendum]]s. The Australian [[head of state]] is the [[Queen of Australia]] who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| last=House of Representatives| title=The Australian System of Government| page=3| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=10 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124621/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| archivedate=12 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |website =Parliamentary Education Office |title=History and Culture: Quick Answers |publisher =Australian Government Publishing Service |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313181036/https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/protocol/protocol_guidelines/15.html| last=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade| authorlink=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)| title=Protocol > Protocol guidelines > The Australian Government| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| last=Australian Public Service Commission| authorlink=Australian Public Service Commission| title=About the Commission > The Australian experience of public sector reform > The Constitutional and Government framework| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313221139/http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| archivedate=13 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/_pdf/australian-citizenship-aug2012.pdf|title=Australian Citizenship \u2013 Our Common Bond|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|date=August 2012}}</ref> with executive powers delegated by [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional convention]] to the Australian [[head of government]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].\n\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into three branches: the executive branch, composed of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the [[Cabinet of Australia]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, composed of the [[Parliament of Australia]]'s [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]] branch, composed of the [[High Court of Australia]] and the [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. [[Separation of powers]] is implied by the structure of the Constitution, the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters (chapters I to III).The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the [[Westminster system|United Kingdom]] ([[Fusion of powers|fused executive]], [[constitutional monarchy]]) and the [[United States Government|United States]] ([[federalism]], [[written constitution]], elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features, and has therefore been characterised as a \"Washminster mutation\".<ref>{{cite article|last=Thompson|first=Elaine|title=The \"Washminster\" Mutation|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=15|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Images of branches of Australian Government}}\n\nSection 1 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] creates a democratic legislature, the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] which consists of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], and two houses of parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51]] of the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as \"heads of power\") to the Commonwealth government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|States]] (previously separate colonies). Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This \"transfer\" legislation may have a \"sunset clause\", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.\n\nIn addition, Australia has several \"territories\", two of which are self-governing:  the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT).  These territories' legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth;  the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The territory of [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never  represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament.  The other territories that are regularly inhabited{{mdash}}[[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]{{mdash}}have never been self-governing.\n\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators.\n\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is [[Local government in Australia|Local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the State), usually serving part-time.  Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located.\n\nGovernment at the Commonwealth level and the State/Territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\n\n* Legislature: The [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]]\n* Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments\n* Judiciary: The [[High Court of Australia]] and subsidiary Federal courts.\n\n''[[Separation of powers]]'' is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other:\n\n* the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms;  the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent\n* the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation\n* the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both [[statute law]] and the [[common law]];  the Australian courts cannot give an [[advisory opinions|advisory opinion]] on the constitutionality of a law, but the [[High Court of Australia]] can determine whether an existing law is constitutional\n* the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth  or State/Territory government;  but the Legislature and the Executive should  not try to influence its decisions.\n\n==Legislature==\n{{main|Parliament of Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nTwelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as \"quota-preferential voting\": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia}}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.\n\nThe day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].\n\n==Executive==\n\n===Head of state===\n{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term \"head of state\". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>\n[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]\nThe [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of Australia, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is also the Sovereign of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s including the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.\n\nSection 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.\n\nUnder the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\n\nAustralia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].\n\n{{further|Constitutional history of Australia|Australian republicanism|Australian head of state dispute}}\n\n===Executive Council===\n{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}\nThe Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"[[The Honourable]]\", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].\n\nThere are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|\"caretaker\" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Australia|List of Australian Ministers}}\n\nThe Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.\n\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.\n\nWhen the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.\n\nWhen the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>\n\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne.

The first state to exercise this both symbolic and real independence was the [[Irish Free State]].

Situated on the western edge of [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], the borough is {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], and {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. The village of [[Campbelltown, Pennsylvania|Campbelltown]] is only {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Palmyra, and carries a Palmyra mailing address.\n\nAlthough no water source runs directly through the borough, the Killinger, [[Quittapahilla Creek|Quittapahilla]], Spring, and [[Swatara Creek|Swatara]] Creeks are all nearby.\n\nPalmyra has a [[humid continental climate]].\n\n==Geology==\nGeologist William E. Kochanov wrote an extensive report on the geology of the Palmyra area as part of the 1995 publication, Karst Geohazards. In his article, Kochanov discusses how the geology of the region contributes to the high number of [[sinkhole]]s found in the area.<ref name=\"Karst GeoHazards\">{{cite book|last1=Beck|title=Karst GeoHazards|date=1995|publisher=Balkema|location=Rotterdam}}</ref>\n\nPalmyra lies in the eastern section of the Great Valley, locally known as the Lebanon Valley. The specific formation beneath Palmyra is an [[Ordovician]] Epler Formation, characterized by a high number of surface depressions and sinkholes. These features serve as natural drains, allowing any water on the surface to permeate the soil and run underground into water tables or into local springs or creeks.\n\nThe development of the borough has interrupted the natural drainage systems present in the Epler Formation. Palmyra is, in reality, a waterless community. All of the natural drainage ways, including the Killinger, Quittapahilla, Spring and Swatara Creeks, lie outside the borough's municipal borders. The storm water runoff is directed outside the borough via a multitude of ways, and it is these discharge areas in which the appearance of sinkholes is most prevalent.\n\nResidents and legislators met in October 1993 to discuss possible solutions to the recurring sinkhole problems. The installation of a storm sewer system was widely supported, but the estimated $10 million cost was a major hurdle. Since the meeting, several projects have been introduced to correct some of the water flow problems of the borough.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early settlement===\nThe land on which Palmyra rests was originally home to the [[Lenape]] and [[Susquehannock]] tribes. The first European explorers and traders came to the region around 1650. Settlers were drawn to the area because of its rich land and abundance of fish and game. Additionally, being part of [[William Penn]]\u2019s colony, his charter providing civil rights and religious freedom also attracted settlers to the area.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\">{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Ray S.|title=This is Palmyra: 200th Anniversary|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of its colonization, many of [[Pennsylvania]]\u2019s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found, or [[squatting]]. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating when they came to the land, it is difficult to precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. From looking at what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, it is clear that the first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the [[Ulster-Scots|Scotch-Irish]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|German Palatinates]].<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe Scotch-Irish immigrants left their homelands due to a number of political, economic and religious reasons. As expected, they were clannish, and tended not to mix with the other ethnic groups settling the area at the same time. They were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area. A majority of the Scotch-Irish were [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and they established several churches as they moved westward across the state. Examples of the churches they built include Derry near Hershey, Donegal in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]],  Paxtang near Harrisburg, and Silver Spring near [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]]. As the years passed, many of the Scotch-Irish continued westward, leaving the Lebanon Valley.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nOf the first Scotch-Irish settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Aspey, Campbell, Caruthers, Ewing, Galbraith, McCallen, McClure, McCord, Mitchell, Sawyer, Walker and Wilson are recorded.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe German Palatinates who settled in Pennsylvania, erroneously known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], also left their homelands for a number of reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and economically they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nOf the first German settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Bindnagle, Bowman, Carmany, Deininger, Early, Forney, Gingrich, Hemperly, Hetrick, Kettering, Killinger, Naftzger, Nye, Ober, Ricker, and Zimmerman are recorded.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe Palmyra area, as well as the entire western edge of the European colonies, was susceptible to attack from the tribes of natives living in the region. In their histories of Lebanon County, Rupp and Egle note many raids that took place in what is now northern Lebanon County. In 1756, the Provincial government decided to build a chain of forts stretching from the [[Susquehanna River]] at Harrisburg in the west to the [[Delaware River]] at [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] in the east. These forts were built at regular intervals, roughly ten to {{convert|15|mi|km|spell=in}} apart, and in any major gaps along the mountains. One of these forts, Fort Swatara, was built by Capt. Frederick Smith near modern-day Inwood where the Swatara Creek flows through the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]]. By the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, the frequency and intensity of native attacks diminished.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\n[[Johannes Palm]], whose name is often anglicized to John Palm, is given credit for founding Palmyra. He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, serving as a doctor and soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. In June 1766, Palm secured the 100-acre plot of land originally surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1951 and previously owned by Conrad Raisch. This plot was roughly bounded by the present-day Railroad Street, Maple Street and the Dauphin County line. By 1776, Palm had drawn up drafts for a settlement he called \u201cPalmstown\u201d, with his residence located on the 100-Block of West Main Street.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\n===Growth of Palmstown===\n\nThe settlement's Post Office was established on April 1, 1804. The name of the town submitted to the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] was \u201cPalmstown\u201d, in honor of Johannes Palm. Yet in 1806, there are records of a tract of land located on both sides of Main Street purchased by John Kean with the settlement being referred to as \u201cPalmyra\u201d, most likely referencing the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] outpost of [[Palmyra]] in [[Syria]]. Although both names were used for a time, the popularity of \u201cPalmyra\u201d had spread and became the official name of the settlement by 1810.<ref name=\"Lebanon County, Pennsylvania - A History\">{{cite book|last1=Carmean|first1=Edna J.|title=Lebanon County, Pennsylvania - A History|date=1976}}</ref>\n\nTransportation from one settlement to the next was essential if either settlement wanted to grow. Turnpike companies were chartered to create improved roads to better facilitate the movement of goods from town to town. Governor Thomas McKean authorized the formation of the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike in 1805. This route was to connect Reading and Hummelstown and employed the main east-west thoroughfare through Palmyra. Upon its opening in 1817, Palmyra gained a direct connection to its neighbors Millerstown (now Annville) and Derry (now Hershey), and to the larger markets in eastern Pennsylvania. The Berks and Dauphin Turnpike existed as a toll road until 1917 and now forms part of [[US 422]].<ref name=\"Lebanon County, Pennsylvania - A History\" />\n\nThe [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania|Downingtown]], [[Ephrata, Pennsylvania|Ephrata]] and Harrisburg Pike, which was commonly known as the Horseshoe Pike, was chartered in 1803 and completed 1819. This ran through Campbelltown just south of Palmyra and later became part of [[US 322]]. Another important route that crossed the Palmyra area included the road which led from the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown, which is now [[PA 117]].<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nWith the opening of these routes, and the incorporation of Harrisburg as the State Capital in 1812, more and more traffic moved through the Palmyra area. The passage of more travelers encouraged taverns and hotels to be built in Palmyra to accommodate them. In the first decades of the 19th century, Palmyra had five taverns and three hotels to serve the needs of those moving through the area. Blacksmith shops, general stores and other small business also began to pop up in Palmyra to serve both travelers and locals alike.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe demand of greater speed and tonnage of goods being moved prompted the building of the [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]]. Completed in 1827, the Union Canal connected the [[Schuylkill River]] at Reading to the Susquehanna River at [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]]. The canal passed just north of Palmyra, and the settlement's citizens benefited from the increased traffic. The canal was later widened to allow larger boats to pass through in 1849. The Age of Steam also came to Palmyra in 1857, as the first locomotives ran through the settlement on the [[Lebanon Valley Railroad]] in that year. Two years later, the Lebanon Valley Railroad merged with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad to form the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]]. The growth of rail traffic signaled the end for the Union Canal, and for the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike as a toll road.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\n===Since the Civil War===\n[[File:Palmyra, Pennsylvania (6480000139).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|First Evangelical Church]]\nPalmyra continued to grow steadily through the 19th & 20th Centuries. By 1845, the settlement consisted of 160 people in about 20 dwellings. By 1875, the population had increased to 500 people in about 100 dwellings. By 1890, the population had skyrocketed in just fifteen years to 1,760 people. And by 1960, the population had reached 7,000.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nWith the fall of [[Fort Sumter]] in 1861 to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] called on volunteers to preserve the Union. About 78 men from the Palmyra area answered the President's call, and donned the blue uniforms of the Union.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] concluded in 1865, a variety of new businesses were established to better serve the Palmyra area. A large grain warehouse, a slaughterhouse and lumber mill were some of the first industries developed in Palmyra. The town's first newspaper was printed in 1878 and was titled \u201cThe Londonderry Gazette\u201d. The Palmyra Bank opened in 1887. The first of several shoe factories opened in 1888. A knitting mill, paper box factory, gas and fuel company, bakery, bottling works, and a feed mill was also open in Palmyra around the start of the 20th century. The growth of [[Milton S. Hershey]]\u2019s chocolate company in nearby Derry also encouraged people to move to the Palmyra area.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n[[File:Landis Shoe LebCo PA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Landis Shoe Company Building]]]]\nIn 1899, the Lebanon Valley Street Railway Company was formed to provide transit across the length of Lebanon County. The trolley line reached Palmyra in 1904. By this time, the Hershey Trolley Company had also formed, and soon thereafter connected to the Lebanon Valley Line at the square in Palmyra. This trolley connected lasted until 1933, when the Lebanon Valley system switched to bus services. By 1946, the Hershey Line also folded.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe [[Landis Shoe Company Building]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===250th anniversary===\nPalmyra celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2010. A committee was formed to plan the commemoration and among other duties, selected the official logo for the anniversary. The design, which is modeled on the Pennsylvania state seal and features the official orange and black colors of the Palmyra School District.

The main street of town was closed to traffic so that scenes could be shot. Dozens of onlookers watched Kudrow and Travolta cruise through the square in a red convertible.\n\n==Economy==\nDue to its position between Harrisburg and Lebanon, and the popularity of neighboring Hershey, Palmyra is economically prosperous. Palmyra is the headquarters for several companies, including [http://www.askfoods.com/ ASK Foods, Inc.], [http://www.decherts.com/ Dechert Dynamics Corp.], [http://www.pachevroletbuickpontiac.com/ Klick-Lewis, Inc.], and the Palmyra Bologna Co., Inc., which produces Seltzer's [[Lebanon bologna|Lebanon Bologna]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 531\n|1890= 768\n|1920= 3646\n|1930= 4377\n|1940= 5239\n|1950= 5910\n|1960= 6999\n|1970= 7615\n|1980= 7228\n|1990= 6910\n|2000= 7096\n|2010= 7320\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7576\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 7,096 people, 3,200 households, and 1,952 families residing in the borough. The [[population density]] was 3,814.3 people per square mile (1,473.0/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 3,363 housing units at an average density of 1,807.7 per square mile (698.1/km<sup>2</sup>).

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $39,677, and the median income for a family was $49,091. Males had a median income of $35,140 versus $25,524 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $20,500. About 3.9% of families and 5.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 5.2% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Education==\nThe first two free public schools opened in Palmyra in 1840. Before this time, church schools and private schools served the children of Palmyra. In addition to the public schools, the Palmyra Academy, also known as the Witmer Academy after its founder, Peter B. Witmer, opened in 1857. The Palmyra Academy was praised as one of the best schools of its kind in the area. It prepared its students for continued education at colleges and universities, and educated students from all around the Susquehanna Valley and neighboring states. The Palmyra Academy closed its doors in 1890, and the Academy Building was torn down nine years later.<ref name=\"Education in Palmyra\">{{cite web|title=Education in Palmyra|url=http://palmyrapa.com/history/education-in-palmyra.html|website=PalmyraPA.com|accessdate=17 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209002807/http://palmyrapa.com/history/education-in-palmyra.html|archivedate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nComing with the growth of the area and the formation of a Borough Government, the Palmyra Borough School District was created in 1913. The first building for the district was erected on South Railroad St. on October 12, 1915. A new secondary school serving grades seven through twelve was built on W. Cherry St. in 1937. In 1952, the directors of the Borough of Palmyra and North Londonderry Township agreed to operate their schools cooperatively, and three years later merged to create the Palmyra Area School District. In 1962, the schools of South Londonderry Township joined the Palmyra Area School District.<ref name=\"Education in Palmyra\" />\n\nSince its formation the district has served the Borough of Palmyra, and both North and South Londonderry Townships, including the villages of Campbelltown, Lawn, and Timber Hills. The [[Palmyra Area School District]] currently operates four elementary schools (Forge Road, Pine Street, Northside and Lingle Avenue), one middle school and one [[Palmyra Area High School|high school]]. All school buildings are located within the Borough of Palmyra, with the exceptions of the high school and Lingle Avenue Elementary, which are just south of the borough limits in North Londonderry

County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. It is part of the [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]] [[Metropolitan statistical area]]. The population was 7,320 at the 2010 census.\n\n==Geography==\nPalmyra is located at {{coord|40.307960|-76.593782|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (40.307960, -76.593782).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.9|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\nPalmyra is located in the Lebanon Valley between [[Annville, Pennsylvania|Annville]] and [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]]. Situated on the western edge of [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], the borough is {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], and {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. The village of [[Campbelltown, Pennsylvania|Campbelltown]] is only {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Palmyra, and carries a Palmyra mailing address.\n\nAlthough no water source runs directly through the borough, the Killinger, [[Quittapahilla Creek|Quittapahilla]], Spring, and [[Swatara Creek|Swatara]] Creeks are all nearby.\n\nPalmyra has a [[humid continental climate]].\n\n==Geology==\nGeologist William E. Kochanov wrote an extensive report on the geology of the Palmyra area as part of the 1995 publication, Karst Geohazards. In his article, Kochanov discusses how the geology of the region contributes to the high number of [[sinkhole]]s found in the area.<ref name=\"Karst GeoHazards\">{{cite book|last1=Beck|title=Karst GeoHazards|date=1995|publisher=Balkema|location=Rotterdam}}</ref>\n\nPalmyra lies in the eastern section of the Great Valley, locally known as the Lebanon Valley. The specific formation beneath Palmyra is an [[Ordovician]] Epler Formation, characterized by a high number of surface depressions and sinkholes. These features serve as natural drains, allowing any water on the surface to permeate the soil and run underground into water tables or into local springs or creeks.\n\nThe development of the borough has interrupted the natural drainage systems present in the Epler Formation. Palmyra is, in reality, a waterless community. All of the natural drainage ways, including the Killinger, Quittapahilla, Spring and Swatara Creeks, lie outside the borough's municipal borders. The storm water runoff is directed outside the borough via a multitude of ways, and it is these discharge areas in which the appearance of sinkholes is most prevalent.\n\nResidents and legislators met in October 1993 to discuss possible solutions to the recurring sinkhole problems. The installation of a storm sewer system was widely supported, but the estimated $10 million cost was a major hurdle. Since the meeting, several projects have been introduced to correct some of the water flow problems of the borough.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early settlement===\nThe land on which Palmyra rests was originally home to the [[Lenape]] and [[Susquehannock]] tribes. The first European explorers and traders came to the region around 1650. Settlers were drawn to the area because of its rich land and abundance of fish and game. Additionally, being part of [[William Penn]]\u2019s colony, his charter providing civil rights and religious freedom also attracted settlers to the area.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\">{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Ray S.|title=This is Palmyra: 200th Anniversary|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of its colonization, many of [[Pennsylvania]]\u2019s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found, or [[squatting]]. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating when they came to the land, it is difficult to precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. From looking at what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, it is clear that the first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the [[Ulster-Scots|Scotch-Irish]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|German Palatinates]].<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe Scotch-Irish immigrants left their homelands due to a number of political, economic and religious reasons. As expected, they were clannish, and tended not to mix with the other ethnic groups settling the area at the same time. They were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area. A majority of the Scotch-Irish were [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and they established several churches as they moved westward across the state. Examples of the churches they built include Derry near Hershey, Donegal in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]],  Paxtang near Harrisburg, and Silver Spring near [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]]. As the years passed, many of the Scotch-Irish continued westward, leaving the Lebanon Valley.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nOf the first Scotch-Irish settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Aspey, Campbell, Caruthers, Ewing, Galbraith, McCallen, McClure, McCord, Mitchell, Sawyer, Walker and Wilson are recorded.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe German Palatinates who settled in Pennsylvania, erroneously known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], also left their homelands for a number of reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and economically they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nOf the first German settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Bindnagle, Bowman, Carmany, Deininger, Early, Forney, Gingrich, Hemperly, Hetrick, Kettering, Killinger, Naftzger, Nye, Ober, Ricker, and Zimmerman are recorded.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe Palmyra area, as well as the entire western edge of the European colonies, was susceptible to attack from the tribes of natives living in the region. In their histories of Lebanon County, Rupp and Egle note many raids that took place in what is now northern Lebanon County. In 1756, the Provincial government decided to build a chain of forts stretching from the [[Susquehanna River]] at Harrisburg in the west to the [[Delaware River]] at [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] in the east. These forts were built at regular intervals, roughly ten to {{convert|15|mi|km|spell=in}} apart, and in any major gaps along the mountains. One of these forts, Fort Swatara, was built by Capt. Frederick Smith near modern-day Inwood where the Swatara Creek flows through the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]]. By the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, the frequency and intensity of native attacks diminished.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\n[[Johannes Palm]], whose name is often anglicized to John Palm, is given credit for founding Palmyra. He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, serving as a doctor and soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. In June 1766, Palm secured the 100-acre plot of land originally surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1951 and previously owned by Conrad Raisch. This plot was roughly bounded by the present-day Railroad Street, Maple Street and the Dauphin County line. By 1776, Palm had drawn up drafts for a settlement he called \u201cPalmstown\u201d, with his residence located on the 100-Block of West Main Street.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\n===Growth of Palmstown===\n\nThe settlement's Post Office was established on April 1, 1804. The name of the town submitted to the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] was \u201cPalmstown\u201d, in honor of Johannes Palm. Yet in 1806, there are records of a tract of land located on both sides of Main Street purchased by John Kean with the settlement being referred to as \u201cPalmyra\u201d, most likely referencing the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] outpost of [[Palmyra]] in [[Syria]]. Although both names were used for a time, the popularity of \u201cPalmyra\u201d had spread and became the official name of the settlement by 1810.<ref name=\"Lebanon County, Pennsylvania - A History\">{{cite book|last1=Carmean|first1=Edna J.|title=Lebanon County, Pennsylvania - A History|date=1976}}</ref>\n\nTransportation from one settlement to the next was essential if either settlement wanted to grow. Turnpike companies were chartered to create improved roads to better facilitate the movement of goods from town to town. Governor Thomas McKean authorized the formation of the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike in 1805. This route was to connect Reading and Hummelstown and employed the main east-west thoroughfare through Palmyra. Upon its opening in 1817, Palmyra gained a direct connection to its neighbors Millerstown (now Annville) and Derry (now Hershey), and to the larger markets in eastern Pennsylvania. The Berks and Dauphin Turnpike existed as a toll road until 1917 and now forms part of [[US 422]].<ref name=\"Lebanon County, Pennsylvania - A History\" />\n\nThe [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania|Downingtown]], [[Ephrata, Pennsylvania|Ephrata]] and Harrisburg Pike, which was commonly known as the Horseshoe Pike, was chartered in 1803 and completed 1819. This ran through Campbelltown just south of Palmyra and later became part of [[US 322]]. Another important route that crossed the Palmyra area included the road which led from the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown, which is now [[PA 117]].<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nWith the opening of these routes, and the incorporation of Harrisburg as the State Capital in 1812, more and more traffic moved through the Palmyra area. The passage of more travelers encouraged taverns and hotels to be built in Palmyra to accommodate them. In the first decades of the 19th century, Palmyra had five taverns and three hotels to serve the needs of those moving through the area. Blacksmith shops, general stores and other small business also began to pop up in Palmyra to serve both travelers and locals alike.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe demand of greater speed and tonnage of goods being moved prompted the building of the [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]]. Completed in 1827, the Union Canal connected the [[Schuylkill River]] at Reading to the Susquehanna River at [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]]. The canal passed just north of Palmyra, and the settlement's citizens benefited from the increased traffic. The canal was later widened to allow larger boats to pass through in 1849. The Age of Steam also came to Palmyra in 1857, as the first locomotives ran through the settlement on the [[Lebanon Valley Railroad]] in that year. Two years later, the Lebanon Valley Railroad merged with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad to form the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]]. The growth of rail traffic signaled the end for the Union Canal, and for the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike as a toll road.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\n===Since the Civil War===\n[[File:Palmyra, Pennsylvania (6480000139).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|First Evangelical Church]]\nPalmyra continued to grow steadily through the 19th & 20th Centuries. By 1845, the settlement consisted of 160 people in about 20 dwellings. By 1875, the population had increased to 500 people in about 100 dwellings. By 1890, the population had skyrocketed in just fifteen years to 1,760 people. And by 1960, the population had reached 7,000.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nWith the fall of [[Fort Sumter]] in 1861 to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] called on volunteers to preserve the Union. About 78 men from the Palmyra area answered the President's call, and donned the blue uniforms of the Union.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] concluded in 1865, a variety of new businesses were established to better serve the Palmyra area. A large grain warehouse, a slaughterhouse and lumber mill were some of the first industries developed in Palmyra. The town's first newspaper was printed in 1878 and was titled \u201cThe Londonderry Gazette\u201d. The Palmyra Bank opened in 1887. The first of several shoe factories opened in 1888. A knitting mill, paper box factory, gas and fuel company, bakery, bottling works, and a feed mill was also open in Palmyra around the start of the 20th century. The growth of [[Milton S. Hershey]]\u2019s chocolate company in nearby Derry also encouraged people to move to the Palmyra area.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n[[File:Landis Shoe LebCo PA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Landis Shoe Company Building]]]]\nIn 1899, the Lebanon Valley Street Railway Company was formed to provide transit across the length of Lebanon County. The trolley line reached Palmyra in 1904. By this time, the Hershey Trolley Company had also formed, and soon thereafter connected to the Lebanon Valley Line at the square in Palmyra. This trolley connected lasted until 1933, when the Lebanon Valley system switched to bus services. By 1946, the Hershey Line also folded.<ref name=\"This is Palmyra\" />\n\nThe [[Landis Shoe Company Building]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===250th anniversary===\nPalmyra celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2010.

The main street of town was closed to traffic so that scenes could be shot. Dozens of onlookers watched Kudrow and Travolta cruise through the square in a red convertible.\n\n==Economy==\nDue to its position between Harrisburg and Lebanon, and the popularity of neighboring Hershey, Palmyra is economically prosperous.

Before this time, church schools and private schools served the children of Palmyra. In addition to the public schools, the Palmyra Academy, also known as the Witmer Academy after its founder, Peter B. Witmer, opened in 1857. The Palmyra Academy was praised as one of the best schools of its kind in the area. It prepared its students for continued education at colleges and universities, and educated students from all around the Susquehanna Valley and neighboring states. The Palmyra Academy closed its doors in 1890, and the Academy Building was torn down nine years later.<ref name=\"Education in Palmyra\">{{cite web|title=Education in Palmyra|url=http://palmyrapa.com/history/education-in-palmyra.html|website=PalmyraPA.com|accessdate=17 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209002807/http://palmyrapa.com/history/education-in-palmyra.html|archivedate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nComing with the growth of the area and the formation of a Borough Government, the Palmyra Borough School District was created in 1913. The first building for the district was erected on South Railroad St. on October 12, 1915. A new secondary school serving grades seven through twelve was built on W. Cherry St. in 1937. In 1952, the directors of the Borough of Palmyra and North Londonderry Township agreed to operate their schools cooperatively, and three years later merged to create the Palmyra Area School District. In 1962, the schools of South Londonderry Township joined the Palmyra Area School District.<ref name=\"Education in Palmyra\" />\n\nSince its formation the district has served the Borough of Palmyra, and both North and South Londonderry Townships, including the villages of Campbelltown, Lawn, and Timber Hills. The [[Palmyra Area School District]] currently operates four elementary schools (Forge Road, Pine Street, Northside and Lingle Avenue), one middle school and one [[Palmyra Area High School|high school]].

There was also an [[Underground Railroad]] station there. Palmerton was officially incorporated in 1912.\n\nIn 1912, the [[New Jersey Zinc Company]] located a [[Zinc smelting]] operation (now the West Plant) here, in order to take advantage of the [[anthracite]] coal being mined just north of Palmerton and the zinc mines in [[Franklin, New Jersey]]. The town was named after New Jersey Zinc's then-President, Stephen S. Palmer, though Palmer was reportedly not pleased with having his name on the town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2010-04-16/news/all-a5_1zinc.7237088apr16_1_west-plant-clean-soil-new-jersey-zinc |title=Developers try to overcome zinc's legacy in Palmerton |author=Jenna Portnoy  |publisher=Allentown  Morning Call |date=April 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA second location, the East Plant, was established on the other side of town in 1911.

(Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].

Early European settlers established the villages of Hazard and Little Gap, which were part of [[Lower Towamensing Township, Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Lower Towamensing Township]]. There was also an [[Underground Railroad]] station there. Palmerton was officially incorporated in 1912.\n\nIn 1912, the [[New Jersey Zinc Company]] located a [[Zinc smelting]] operation (now the West Plant) here, in order to take advantage of the [[anthracite]] coal being mined just north of Palmerton and the zinc mines in [[Franklin, New Jersey]]. The town was named after New Jersey Zinc's then-President, Stephen S. Palmer, though Palmer was reportedly not pleased with having his name on the town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2010-04-16/news/all-a5_1zinc.7237088apr16_1_west-plant-clean-soil-new-jersey-zinc |title=Developers try to overcome zinc's legacy in Palmerton |author=Jenna Portnoy  |publisher=Allentown  Morning Call |date=April 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA second location, the East Plant, was established on the other side of town in 1911. Though other industries, such as several garment manufacturing shops, came to Palmerton, the zinc company was the major employer for most of the town's history. Much of the population came to the site, principally from [[Eastern Europe]], in order to work in the zinc plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tnonline.com/2010/jun/10/architectural-historical-tour-hikes-round-park-palmerton?page=1 |title=Architectural, historical tour hikes round the park in Palmerton |author=ELSA KERSCHNER  |publisher=Times News Online |date=June 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nZinc smelting was ended in 1980 due to a poor zinc market and [[environmental regulation]]. The West Plant was demolished in 2010. The East Plant continues to operate at reduced capacity, processing electric arc furnace dust into zinc [[calcine]].\n\nThe Palmer House, a five-story Senior Citizens residence at 360 Delaware Avenue is on the site of the former Palm Theater.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/25441 |author=Cinema Treasures |title=Palm Theater |year=2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Palmerton Historic District]], covering the downtown area, was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 19, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Program: Weekly List |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20180126.htm |date=January 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nPalmerton is located in southern Carbon County at {{Coord|40|48|11|N|75|36|43|W|type:city}} (40.803077, -75.611808).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It lies just north of the junction of the [[Lehigh River]] and [[Aquashicola Creek]], which in turn is just north of the [[Lehigh Gap]] through [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]].

Outside the [[English-speaking world]] the rector is often the most senior official in a university, whilst in the [[United States]] the most senior official is often referred to as [[President (corporate title)|President]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the most senior official is the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], whose office is primarily ceremonial and [[Titular ruler|titular]]. The term and office of a rector can be referred to as a '''rectorate'''.\nThe title is used widely in universities in Europe.<ref group=Notes>European nations where the word ''rector'' or words like it (''rektor'', ''recteur'', etc.) is used in referring to university administrators include [[Albania]], [[Benelux|the Benelux]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Scotland]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]].</ref> and is very common in [[Latin American]] countries.<ref group=Notes>\"Rector\" is used for university administrators in Latin American nations such as: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].</ref> It is also used in [[Brunei]], [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]] and the [[Middle East]]. In the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] the office is sometimes referred to as ''Lord Rector'', is the third most senior official, and is usually responsible for chairing the [[University Court]].\n\n==Europe==\nThe head of a university in Germany is called a ''president'', ''rector magnificus'' (men) or ''rectrix magnifica'' (women), as in some Belgian universities. In Dutch universities, the ''rector magnificus'' is the most publicly prominent member of the board, responsible for the scientific agenda of the university. In the Netherlands, the rector is, however, not the chair of the university board. The chair has, in practice, the most influence over the management of the University.\n\nIn some countries, including Germany, the position of head teacher in secondary schools is also designated as rector. In the Netherlands, the terms \"rector\" and \"conrector\" (assistant head) are used commonly for high school directors. This is also the case in some Maltese secondary schools.\n\nIn the Scandinavian countries, the head of a university or a gymnasium (higher secondary schools) is called a ''rektor''. In Sweden and Norway, this term is also used for the heads of primary schools. In Finland, the head of a primary school or secondary schools is called a rector (''rehtori'') provided the school is of sufficient size in terms of faculty and students, otherwise the title is headmaster (''koulunjohtaja''). The head of some Finnish universities is called chancellor (\"kansleri\").\n\nIn the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Portugal's and Spain's university heads or presidents have the title . Those universities whose foundation has been historically approved by the Pope, as e.g. the rector of the [[University of Coimbra]], the oldest Portuguese university, is referred to as ''Magn\u00edfico Reitor (Rector's name)'' (\"Rector Magnificus (Rector's Name)\"). The others are referred to as ''Excelent\u00edssimo Senhor Reitor''. In Spain, all Rectors must be addressed as ''Se\u00f1or Rector Magn\u00edfico'' according to the law (Ley Org\u00e1nica 4/2007), but the Rector of the [[University of Salamanca]], the oldest on the Iberian Peninsula, is usually styled according to academic protocol as ''Excelent\u00edsimo y Ilustr\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or Profesor Doctor [[Don (honorific)|Don]] (Rector's name), Rector Magn\u00edfico de la Universidad de Salamanca'' (\"The Most Excellent and Most Illustrious Lord Professor Doctor Don (Rector's name), ''Rector Magnificus'' of the University of Salamanca\").\n\n=== Austrian Empire ===\nIn a few \"Crown lands\" of the Austrian Empire, one seat in the ''[[Landtag]]'' (regional legislature of semi-feudal type) was reserved for the rector of the capital's university, notably: Graz in [[Steiermark]] (Styria), [[Innsbruck]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], Wien (Vienna) in [[Nieder-\u00d6sterreich]] (Lower Austria); in [[Bohemia]], two Rectors seated in the equivalent [[Landesvertretung]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Austria ===\nToday Austrian universities are headed by a Rectorate consisting of one Rector (elected by the [[Universit\u00e4tsrat]]) and 3-5 additional Vizerectors. The Rector is the CEO of the university.<ref>[[:de:Universit\u00e4tsgesetz 2002]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Czech Republic===\nThe heads of [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|Czech universities]] are called the ''rektor''. The rector acts in the name of the university and decides the university's affairs unless prohibited by law. The rector is nominated by the University Academic Senate and appointed by the [[President of the Czech Republic]]. The nomination must be agreed by a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]] of all senators, while a dismissal must be agreed by at least three fifths of all senators. The vote to elect or repeal a rector is secret. The term of office is four years and a person may hold it for at most two consecutive terms.\n\nThe rector appoints vice-rectors (''pro-rektor''), who act as deputies to the extent determined by the Rector. Rectors' salaries are determined directly by the Minister of Education.\n\nAmong the most important rectors of Czech universities were reformer [[Jan Hus]], physician [[Jan Jesenius]], theologian [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and representative of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[Josef Vratislav Monse]]. [[Ji\u0159ina Popelov\u00e1]] ([[Palack\u00fd University of Olomouc]]) became the first female Rector in 1950.\n\nThe rectors are addressed \"Your Magnificence Rector\" (''\"Va\u0161e Magnificence pane rektore\"'').\n\n\n===Denmark===\nIn Danish, ''rektor'' is the title used in referring to the heads of universities, [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], schools of commerce and construction, etc. Generally ''rektor'' may be used for the head of any educational institution above the primary school level, where the head is commonly referred to as a 'skoleinspekt\u00f8r' (Headmaster; Inspector of the school). In universities, the second-ranked official of governance is known as ''prorektor''.\n\n===England===\nMost English universities are formally headed by \"chancellors\"; however, at [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]], most colleges are headed by a \"master\" or a \"principal\" as the chief academic. In a few colleges, the equivalent person is called a \"president\", \"provost\", or \"warden\".  At two Oxford colleges, [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], the head is called \"rector\". At Oxford and Cambridge, the university's overall head is called \"chancellor\", but this is chiefly a ceremonial position while the academic head of each university is the \"vice-chancellor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/chancellor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204123528/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/chancellor.html |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }} University of Cambridge - How the University works - The Chancellor</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/key_university_officers/chancellor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504043351/http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/key_university_officers/chancellor.html |archivedate=4 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Oxford University - Key University Officers - The Chancellor</ref>\n\nAt [[St Chad's College]], one of the two so-called \"recognised colleges\" of the [[University of Durham]], there is a \"rector\" as titular head (the Dean of Durham Cathedral ''ex officio'') while the academic head is the \"principal\".\n\nThe University of London has a chancellor (a ceremonial post) and a vice-chancellor (equivalent to a managing director). All colleges have a chief academic as head, using a variety of titles. At [[University College London]], the head is the \"provost\"; at [[King's College London]] the head is the \"principal\"; at [[Imperial College London]] the [[President of Imperial College London|head]] was until recently called the rector, until this was split into a [[Provost (education)|provost]] and president; and the [[London School of Economics]] is headed by a \"director\".\n\nAt most other universities in England, the chancellor is the ceremonial head whilst the vice-chancellor is the chief academic. The vice-chancellor of [[Liverpool Hope University]], also takes the role of rector.\n\nPrior to their conversion to universities, polytechnics often had the rector as the head of the establishment; following their transition to universities, the rector became the vice-chancellor.\n\n===Germany===\n\nThe head of a German university is either called \"Rektor\" (rector) or \"Pr\u00e4sident\" (president). The difference is usually that a \"Rektor\" is elected by the Senate from among the professors of the university (which is the traditional method of choosing the head of a German university), while a \"Pr\u00e4sident\" need neither be a professor nor a member of the university (or of any university) prior to appointment. The \"Rektor\" is traditionally addressed as \"Magnifizenz\".\n\n===Iceland===\nThe ''rektor'' is term used for the headmaster or headmistress of Icelandic universities and of some [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]].\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Renzi Dionigi 2015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rector of [[Bologna University]], Ivano Dionigi, with then Prime Minister of Italy [[Matteo Renzi]], in 2015.]]\nIn [[Italy]] the rector is the head of the university and ''Rappresentante Legale'' (Legal representative) of the university.  He or she is elected by an electoral body composed of all ''Professori ordinari ed associati'' (full and associate professors), the two highest ranks of the Italian university faculty, all the ''Ricercatori'' (lowest rank of departments) and representatives of the staff, students and PhD students.\n\nThe term of a ''rettore'' is now six years, in accordance with the new national regulation and the ''statuto'' (constitution of the university).\n\nThe Rettore is styled and formally greeted as ''Magnifico Rettore'' (Magnificent Rector).\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, the rector is the principal of a high school. The rector is supported by conrectors (deputy rectors who can take his place).\n\nIn Dutch universities, the ''Rector Magnificus''  is responsible for the scientific vision and quality of the university. The ''rector magnificus'' is one of the members of the executive board of a university. The ''rector magnificus'' is a [[full professor]]. The ceremonial responsibilities of the ''rector magnificus ''are to open the [[academic year]], and to preside over the ceremonial PhD defenses and inaugural lectures of newly appointed (full) professors. During PhD defenses the rector is usually replaced by another full professor who is acting rector during the session.\n\n===Norway===\nA rector ({{lang-no|rektor}}), in the context of academia, is the democratically elected head of a university or university college. The rector is the highest official of the university, and is traditionally elected among the institution's professorship, originally by all the (full) professors and in modern times by all academic employees, the students and the non-academic employees. The rector is traditionally the head of the ''Collegium Academicum'', which has been renamed the university board in the 2000s, and is also the university's chief executive and ceremonial head. The elected deputy of the rector is known as pro-rector ({{lang-no|prorektor}}). Some institutions also have vice rectors, who are appointed by the rector and subordinate to the rector and pro-rector. \n\nTraditionally, Norwegian universities and colleges had democratic elections for the rector and pro-rector positions. Since 2016, the institutions may choose to have an elected or an appointed rector <ref>https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-04-01-15/\u00a710-2</ref>. Universities and colleges usually have a ''university director'' or ''college director'', who is the head of the administration (i.e., the non-academic employees) and subordinate to the rectorate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]], the rector ({{lang-pl|rektor}}) is the elected head of a university or university college, in military, military type upper educaction institutions name of rector like official is ({{lang-pl|komendant}}) (commander). The rector is the highest official of the [[university]]. Rector of the university can be a person with at least a [[doctor (title)|doctoral]] degree, employed by the university as the main place of work. Rector is referred to as Jego/Jej Magnificencja (en. His/Her Magnificence) (abbreviation: JM). The outfit of rector is red or purple coat (robe) with [[ermine]] fur, often with a [[scepter]] and a decorative string of symbols of the university. Deputy rectors ({{lang-pl|prorektor}}) at official ceremonies are dressed in the same [[gown]], but with fewer decorations (usually without the fur). Rectors of military universities wear only an officer's uniform and a necklace with symbols of the university.\n\nAs of 2008, the term of office of the rector of public universities lasts for 4 years (previously 3 years), beginning on 1 September in an election year and ending on 31 August of the year in which the term ends. A person may not be elected to serve as rector for more than two consecutive terms. In the case of private universities the rule is regulated by [[university]] statute.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]], the rector ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Reitor'') is the highest official of each university. The title of the rector of the universities whose foundation has been historically approved by the Pope, as the University of Coimbra, the Univ. of \u00c9vora or, in modern times, the Catholic University, is called ''Magn\u00edfico Reitor'' (Magnificus Rector, as the rector was called in the Latin documents). Each university faculty is headed by a director or a president of the directorate council, and the rector heads all of them.\n\nUntil 1974, the director of each [[Lyceum#Portugal|Lyceum]] (high school) also had the title of Rector.\n\n===Russia===\nIn [[Russia]], the rector ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''\u0420\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440'') as a term for a university chancellor introduced in 1961.

To some extent the office of rector has evolved into more of a figurehead role, with a significant number of celebrities and personalities elected as rectors, such as [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Lorraine Kelly]] at [[Rector of the University of Dundee|Dundee]], [[Clarissa Dickson Wright]] at [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], and [[John Cleese]] and [[Frank Muir]] at [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]], and political figures, such as [[Mordechai Vanunu]] at [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Glasgow]].

Formally styled as ''Excelent\u00edsimo e Ilustr\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or Profesor Doctor Don N, Rector Magn\u00edfico de la Universidad de X'' (\"Most Excellent and Illustrious Lord Professor Doctor Don N, Rector Magnificus of the University of X\"), it is an office of high dignity within Spanish society, usually being highly respected. It is not strange to see them appear in the media, especially when some academic-related subject is being discussed and their opinion is requested.\n\nSpanish rectors are chosen from within the body of university full [[professor]]s (''Catedr\u00e1ticos'' in Spanish); it is compulsory for anyone aspiring to become a rector to have been a doctor for at least six years before his election, and to have achieved professor status, holding it in the same university for which he is running. Usually, when running for election, the rector will need to have chosen the vice-rectors (''vicerrectores'' in Spanish), who will occupy several sub-offices in the university. Rectors are elected directly by free and secret universal suffrage of all the members of the university, including students, lecturers, readers, researchers, and civil servants. However, the weight of the vote in each academic sector is different: the total student vote usually represents 20% of the whole, no matter how many students there are; the votes of the entire group made up of professors and readers (members of what used to be known as the ''Claustro'' (''[[cloister]]'')) usually count for about 40-50% of the total; lecturers, researchers (including Ph.D. students and others) and non-doctoral teachers, about 20% of the total; and the remainder (usually some 5-10%) is left for non-scholarly workers (people in administration, etc.) in the university. Spanish law allows those percentages to be changed according to the situation of each university, or even not to have a direct election system. Indeed, in a few universities the Rector is chosen indirectly; the members of the modern ''Claustro'' (a sort of electoral college or parliament in which all the above-mentioned groups are represented) is chosen first, and then the Claustro selects the Rector.\n\nRectors hold their office for four years before another election is held, and there is no limit to the number of re-election terms. However, only the most charismatic and respected rectors have been able to hold their office for more than two or three terms. Of those, some have been notable [[Spanish people|Spanish]] scholars, such as [[Basque people|Basque]] writer [[Miguel de Unamuno]], Rector of the [[University of Salamanca]] from 1901 until 1936.\n\n===Sweden===\n''Rektor'' is the title for the highest-ranked administrative and educational leader for an academic institution, such as a primary school, secondary school, private school, high school, college or university. The ''rektors'' of state-run colleges and universities are formally appointed by the government, i.e. the cabinet, but upon the advice of the concerned institution's board, and usually following some sort of democratic process at the concerned institution. The adjunct of a ''rektor'' at a university is called a ''prorektor'' and is appointed by the institution's board.\n\nIn the older universities, [[Uppsala university]] and [[Lund university]], the ''rektor'' is titled ''rector magnificus'' (men), or ''rectrix magnifica'' (women). Younger universities have in more recent years started using the Latin honorary title in formal situations, such as in honorary speeches or graduation ceremonies.\n\nThe University Chancellor of Sweden was until 2017 the title of the head of the government accrediting agency, the [[National Agency for Higher Education]]. From 2017, this position carries the title Director General which is the usual title of the head of a government agency. The people recruited to the position have in later times always been former vice-chancellors (presidents) of a Swedish university. The position does not include leadership of a university.\n\n===Switzerland===\nThe heads of the [[universities in Switzerland]], usually elected by the college of professors, are titled rector (''Rektor'', ''recteur'').\n\n===Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey===\nThe rector is the head of most universities and other higher educational institutions in at least parts of Central and Eastern Europe, such as Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Poland, Romania, Russia, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, Hungary and Ukraine. The rector's deputies are known as \"pro-rectors\". Individual departments of a university (called [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]) are headed by [[Dean (education)|deans]].\n\n==North America==\n\n===Canada===\nAs in most Commonwealth and British-influenced countries, the term \"rector\" is not commonly used in Canada.\n\nQuebec's universities, both francophone (e.g., ''[[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]]'') and anglophone (e.g., [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]), use the term (''recteur'' or ''rectrice'' in French) to designate the head of the institution.  In addition, the historically French-Catholic, and now bilingual, [[Saint Paul University]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario uses the term to denote its head.  St. Paul's College, the Roman Catholic College of the University of Manitoba, uses the term 'rector' to designate the head of the College.  St. Boniface College, the French College of the University of Manitoba, uses 'recteur' or 'rectrice' to designate the head of the College.\n\nAt the bilingual [[University of Ottawa]], the term president has been used since 2008, but before that time rector was used for the English name; however, ''recteur'' (or ''rectrice'') continues to be used as the French term for the head of the university.\n\n[[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] ([[Kingston, Ontario]]) uses the term \"rector\".  The term refers to a member of the student body elected to work as an equal with the [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] and [[Principal (university)|principal]]. The Badge of Office of the Rector of Queen's University was registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on 15 October 2004.<ref>http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=511 Badge of Office</ref> See [[List of Rectors of Queen's University]]. [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] also use the title.\n\n===United States===\nMost U.S. colleges do not use the term \"rector.\" The terms \"president\" and \"chancellor\" are often used for the chief executive of universities and university systems, depending on the institution's statutes or governing documents. Some state university systems have both \"presidents\" of the constituent institutions and a \"chancellor\" of the overall system, or vice versa; for example, in the [[University of California|University of California system]], each of the ten campuses is headed by a chancellor, while the leader of the system is given the title \"president.\" Colleges and universities, or state systems, also typically have [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States|governing boards]] (akin to a [[board of directors]]), which may be referred to by a variety of names, including \"board of trustees\" and \"board of regents,\" and which are usually led by a chairperson.\n\n\"Rector\" is commonly used in [[Virginia]], however. The [[University of Virginia]] ([[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]), [[University of Mary Washington]] ([[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]), [[George Mason University]] ([[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]]), [[Virginia State University]] ([[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]]), [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] ([[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]), [[Longwood University]] ([[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]]), [[Washington and Lee University]] ([[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]]), the [[College of William and Mary]] ([[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]), [[Old Dominion University]] ([[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]), [[Christopher Newport University]] ([[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]), and [[Virginia Tech]] ([[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]]) all use the term \"Rector\" to designate the presiding officer of the [[Board of Visitors]] (or \"Board of Trustees,\" in the case of Washington and Lee). [[Thomas Jefferson]] served as the first rector of the University of Virginia, beginning in 1819, and intended that the school would not have a president; it lacked that position until 1904.\n\nFrom 1701-1745, the head of the school that was to become [[Yale University]] was termed the \"rector\".  As head of [[Yale College]], [[Thomas Clap]] was both the last to be called \"rector\" (1740\u20131745) and the first to be referred to as president (1745\u20131766).  Modern custom omits the use of the term \"rector\" and identifies [[Abraham Pierson]] as the first Yale president (1701\u20131707), making Clap the fifth of Yale's leaders, regardless of title.<ref>Welch, Lewis ''et al.'' (1899).

In many cases, the rector was also the head of the community of priests assigned to the school, so the two posts &ndash; head of the university and local superior of the priests &ndash; were merged in the role of rector (''See \"Ecclesiastical rectors\" below''). This practice is no longer followed, as the details of the governance of most of these schools have changed.  At the [[University of Notre Dame]], the title \"rector\" is used for those in charge of individual [[List of residence halls at the University of Notre Dame|residence halls]].\n\nSome American high schools also have a rector; for example, at [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[New Hampshire]], the Rector is equivalent to a [[Head teacher|Headmaster]] (head of the school).\n\n==Australia==\nThe term \"rector\" is uncommon in Australian academic institutions. The executive head of an Australian university has traditionally been given the British title Vice-Chancellor, although in recent times the American term President has also been adopted. The term rector is used by some academic institutions, such as the University of Melbourne residential college, Newman College; the private boys' school, Xavier College; and the University of Sydney residential college, St John's College (Benedictine).\n\nThe title rector is sometimes used for the head of a subordinate and geographically separate campus of a university.  For example, the executive head of the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in Canberra, which is a campus of the [[University of New South Wales]] in Sydney is a Rector, as is the head of the Cairns campus of [[James Cook University]], based at Townsville.\n\n==New Zealand==\nThe title is used in New Zealand for the [[headmaster]] of some independent schools, such as [[Lindisfarne College, New Zealand|Lindisfarne College]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream]], as well as a number of state schools for boys, including [[Otago Boys' High School]], [[King's High School, Dunedin]], [[Waitaki Boys' High School]], [[Timaru Boys' High School]], [[Palmerston North Boys' High School]] and [[Southland Boys' High School]] showing the Scots' involvement in the foundation of those schools.\n\n== Africa ==\n\n=== Mauritius ===\nIn Mauritius the term 'rector' is used to designate the head of a secondary school.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Asia==\n\n===India===\nThe heads of certain Indian [[boarding school]]s are called rectors. The head or principal of a Catholic school in India is also called a rector.\n===Indonesia===\nRector is the highest executive post in universities in Indonesia. At a public university, university senate members select a pool three candidates for the education minister to decide the rector from. Except for autonomous public university (PTN-BH), rector was elected by university board of trustees. The final decision is not necessarily the one with the majority of the university senate's votes.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/09/nearly-100-years-after-its-founding-itb-names-first-female-rector.html|title=Nearly 100 years after its founding, ITB names first female rector|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:YushimaSeido8678.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Colonnade at the reconstructed ''[[Yushima Seid\u014d]]'' in Tokyo.

A ''Rektor'' is comparable to the position of ''Naib Canselor'', or vice-chancellor, in other higher education institutions, as the ''Rektor'' answers to the ''[[Chancellor (education)|Canselor]]''.\n\n===Myanmar===\nThe term ''rector'' ([[Burmese language|Burmese]]:''\u1015\u102b\u1019\u1031\u102c\u1000\u1039\u1001\u1001\u103b\u102f\u1015\u103a'') is used to refer to the highest official of universities in [[Myanmar]]. Each university department is headed by a professor, who is responsible to the rector. Nowadays, given the large dimensions of some universities, the position of pro-rector has emerged, just below that of the rector. Pro-rectors are in charge of managing particular areas of the university, such as research or [[undergraduate education]].\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe heads of certain universities and colleges such as [[National University of Sciences & Technology]], [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology]], [[Forman Christian College]], [[Virtual University of Pakistan]], [[COMSATS Institute of Information Technology]] and PIEAS are all titled \"Rector\".\n\n===Philippines===\n[[File:Rector Herminio Dagohoy of Santo Tomas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herminio Dagohoy]], the 96th Rector Magnificus of the [[University of Santo Tomas|Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas]], Manila]]\n{{See also|Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas}}\nThe term ''rector'' or ''Rector Magnificus'' is used to refer to the highest official in prominent Catholic universities and colleges such as the [[University of Santo Tomas|University of Santo Tom\u00e1s]], the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letr\u00e1n]], and the [[San Beda University]]. The rector typically sits as chair of the university board of trustees. He exercises policy-making, general academic, managerial, and religious functions over all university academic and non-academic staff.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, on 20 May 1865, a royal order from Queen Isabella II gave the [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas]] the power to direct and supervise all the educational institutions in the Philippines and thus, the Rector of the University became the ''ex officio'' head of the secondary and higher education in the Philippines.

[[Thammasat University]] adopts this term for this position to reflect its tradition associated with the French education system where [[Pridi Banomyong]], Thammasat's founding father was educated.\n\nExcept [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]], the only International Catholic University in Thailand, the position of the head of the executives and administrators of the institute is \"rector\". A decade after the present rector assume his duty, the title of Rector Magnificus was bestowed on Rev. Bro.

Each faculty ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]:''Facultad'') has its own dean.\n\n===Brazil===\nThe term ''rector'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Reitor'') is used to refer to the highest official of universities in [[Brazil]]. Each faculty is headed by a director, who is under the authority of the rector. Nowadays, given the large size of some universities, the position of pro-rector has emerged below that of the rector. The pro-rector is in charge of managing a particular area of the university, such as research or [[undergraduate education]].\n\n==Compound titles==\nA rector who has resigned is often given the title ''rector [[emeritus]]''. One who temporarily performs the functions usually fulfilled by a rector is styled a ''pro-rector'' (in parishes, administrator).\n\nDeputies of rectors in institutions are known as ''vice-rector''s (in parishes, as curates, assistant - or associate rectors, etc.). In some universities the title vice-rector has, like [[vice-chancellor]] in many Anglo-Saxon cases, been used for the de facto head when the essentially honorary title of rector is reserved for a high externa dignitary; until 1920, there was such a ''vice-recteur'' at the Parisian [[Sorbonne]] as the French Minister of Education was its nominal ''recteur''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chancellor (education)]]\n* [[Dean (education)]]\n* [[Prorector]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Rector}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rector}}\n\n[[Category:Academic administration]]\n[[Category:Heads of universities and colleges| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Academic official}}\n{{Other uses|Rector (disambiguation){{!}}Rector}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n{{cleanup-rewrite|date=March 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Inauguration-Lubomir-Dvorak.jpg|thumb|right|Inauguration of Rector Lubom\u00edr Dvo\u0159\u00e1k ([[Palack\u00fd University of Olomouc|Palack\u00fd University]])]]\n\nA '''rector''' (\u2018ruler\u2019, from {{Lang|la|rector}} meaning \u2019ruler\u2019) is a senior official in an [[educational institution]], and can refer to an official in either a [[university]] or a [[secondary school]]. Outside the [[English-speaking world]] the rector is often the most senior official in a university, whilst in the [[United States]] the most senior official is often referred to as [[President (corporate title)|President]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the most senior official is the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], whose office is primarily ceremonial and [[Titular ruler|titular]].

In the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] the office is sometimes referred to as ''Lord Rector'', is the third most senior official, and is usually responsible for chairing the [[University Court]].\n\n==Europe==\nThe head of a university in Germany is called a ''president'', ''rector magnificus'' (men) or ''rectrix magnifica'' (women), as in some Belgian universities. In Dutch universities, the ''rector magnificus'' is the most publicly prominent member of the board, responsible for the scientific agenda of the university. In the Netherlands, the rector is, however, not the chair of the university board. The chair has, in practice, the most influence over the management of the University.\n\nIn some countries, including Germany, the position of head teacher in secondary schools is also designated as rector. In the Netherlands, the terms \"rector\" and \"conrector\" (assistant head) are used commonly for high school directors. This is also the case in some Maltese secondary schools.\n\nIn the Scandinavian countries, the head of a university or a gymnasium (higher secondary schools) is called a ''rektor''. In Sweden and Norway, this term is also used for the heads of primary schools. In Finland, the head of a primary school or secondary schools is called a rector (''rehtori'') provided the school is of sufficient size in terms of faculty and students, otherwise the title is headmaster (''koulunjohtaja''). The head of some Finnish universities is called chancellor (\"kansleri\").\n\nIn the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Portugal's and Spain's university heads or presidents have the title . Those universities whose foundation has been historically approved by the Pope, as e.g. the rector of the [[University of Coimbra]], the oldest Portuguese university, is referred to as ''Magn\u00edfico Reitor (Rector's name)'' (\"Rector Magnificus (Rector's Name)\"). The others are referred to as ''Excelent\u00edssimo Senhor Reitor''. In Spain, all Rectors must be addressed as ''Se\u00f1or Rector Magn\u00edfico'' according to the law (Ley Org\u00e1nica 4/2007), but the Rector of the [[University of Salamanca]], the oldest on the Iberian Peninsula, is usually styled according to academic protocol as ''Excelent\u00edsimo y Ilustr\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or Profesor Doctor [[Don (honorific)|Don]] (Rector's name), Rector Magn\u00edfico de la Universidad de Salamanca'' (\"The Most Excellent and Most Illustrious Lord Professor Doctor Don (Rector's name), ''Rector Magnificus'' of the University of Salamanca\").\n\n=== Austrian Empire ===\nIn a few \"Crown lands\" of the Austrian Empire, one seat in the ''[[Landtag]]'' (regional legislature of semi-feudal type) was reserved for the rector of the capital's university, notably: Graz in [[Steiermark]] (Styria), [[Innsbruck]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], Wien (Vienna) in [[Nieder-\u00d6sterreich]] (Lower Austria); in [[Bohemia]], two Rectors seated in the equivalent [[Landesvertretung]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Austria ===\nToday Austrian universities are headed by a Rectorate consisting of one Rector (elected by the [[Universit\u00e4tsrat]]) and 3-5 additional Vizerectors. The Rector is the CEO of the university.<ref>[[:de:Universit\u00e4tsgesetz 2002]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Czech Republic===\nThe heads of [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|Czech universities]] are called the ''rektor''. The rector acts in the name of the university and decides the university's affairs unless prohibited by law. The rector is nominated by the University Academic Senate and appointed by the [[President of the Czech Republic]]. The nomination must be agreed by a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]] of all senators, while a dismissal must be agreed by at least three fifths of all senators. The vote to elect or repeal a rector is secret. The term of office is four years and a person may hold it for at most two consecutive terms.\n\nThe rector appoints vice-rectors (''pro-rektor''), who act as deputies to the extent determined by the Rector. Rectors' salaries are determined directly by the Minister of Education.\n\nAmong the most important rectors of Czech universities were reformer [[Jan Hus]], physician [[Jan Jesenius]], theologian [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and representative of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[Josef Vratislav Monse]]. [[Ji\u0159ina Popelov\u00e1]] ([[Palack\u00fd University of Olomouc]]) became the first female Rector in 1950.\n\nThe rectors are addressed \"Your Magnificence Rector\" (''\"Va\u0161e Magnificence pane rektore\"'').\n\n\n===Denmark===\nIn Danish, ''rektor'' is the title used in referring to the heads of universities, [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], schools of commerce and construction, etc. Generally ''rektor'' may be used for the head of any educational institution above the primary school level, where the head is commonly referred to as a 'skoleinspekt\u00f8r' (Headmaster; Inspector of the school). In universities, the second-ranked official of governance is known as ''prorektor''.\n\n===England===\nMost English universities are formally headed by \"chancellors\"; however, at [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]], most colleges are headed by a \"master\" or a \"principal\" as the chief academic. In a few colleges, the equivalent person is called a \"president\", \"provost\", or \"warden\".  At two Oxford colleges, [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], the head is called \"rector\". At Oxford and Cambridge, the university's overall head is called \"chancellor\", but this is chiefly a ceremonial position while the academic head of each university is the \"vice-chancellor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/chancellor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204123528/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/chancellor.html |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }} University of Cambridge - How the University works - The Chancellor</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/key_university_officers/chancellor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504043351/http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/key_university_officers/chancellor.html |archivedate=4 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Oxford University - Key University Officers - The Chancellor</ref>\n\nAt [[St Chad's College]], one of the two so-called \"recognised colleges\" of the [[University of Durham]], there is a \"rector\" as titular head (the Dean of Durham Cathedral ''ex officio'') while the academic head is the \"principal\".\n\nThe University of London has a chancellor (a ceremonial post) and a vice-chancellor (equivalent to a managing director). All colleges have a chief academic as head, using a variety of titles. At [[University College London]], the head is the \"provost\"; at [[King's College London]] the head is the \"principal\"; at [[Imperial College London]] the [[President of Imperial College London|head]] was until recently called the rector, until this was split into a [[Provost (education)|provost]] and president; and the [[London School of Economics]] is headed by a \"director\".\n\nAt most other universities in England, the chancellor is the ceremonial head whilst the vice-chancellor is the chief academic. The vice-chancellor of [[Liverpool Hope University]], also takes the role of rector.\n\nPrior to their conversion to universities, polytechnics often had the rector as the head of the establishment; following their transition to universities, the rector became the vice-chancellor.\n\n===Germany===\n\nThe head of a German university is either called \"Rektor\" (rector) or \"Pr\u00e4sident\" (president). The difference is usually that a \"Rektor\" is elected by the Senate from among the professors of the university (which is the traditional method of choosing the head of a German university), while a \"Pr\u00e4sident\" need neither be a professor nor a member of the university (or of any university) prior to appointment. The \"Rektor\" is traditionally addressed as \"Magnifizenz\".\n\n===Iceland===\nThe ''rektor'' is term used for the headmaster or headmistress of Icelandic universities and of some [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]].\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Renzi Dionigi 2015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rector of [[Bologna University]], Ivano Dionigi, with then Prime Minister of Italy [[Matteo Renzi]], in 2015.]]\nIn [[Italy]] the rector is the head of the university and ''Rappresentante Legale'' (Legal representative) of the university.  He or she is elected by an electoral body composed of all ''Professori ordinari ed associati'' (full and associate professors), the two highest ranks of the Italian university faculty, all the ''Ricercatori'' (lowest rank of departments) and representatives of the staff, students and PhD students.\n\nThe term of a ''rettore'' is now six years, in accordance with the new national regulation and the ''statuto'' (constitution of the university).\n\nThe Rettore is styled and formally greeted as ''Magnifico Rettore'' (Magnificent Rector).\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, the rector is the principal of a high school. The rector is supported by conrectors (deputy rectors who can take his place).\n\nIn Dutch universities, the ''Rector Magnificus''  is responsible for the scientific vision and quality of the university. The ''rector magnificus'' is one of the members of the executive board of a university. The ''rector magnificus'' is a [[full professor]]. The ceremonial responsibilities of the ''rector magnificus ''are to open the [[academic year]], and to preside over the ceremonial PhD defenses and inaugural lectures of newly appointed (full) professors. During PhD defenses the rector is usually replaced by another full professor who is acting rector during the session.\n\n===Norway===\nA rector ({{lang-no|rektor}}), in the context of academia, is the democratically elected head of a university or university college. The rector is the highest official of the university, and is traditionally elected among the institution's professorship, originally by all the (full) professors and in modern times by all academic employees, the students and the non-academic employees. The rector is traditionally the head of the ''Collegium Academicum'', which has been renamed the university board in the 2000s, and is also the university's chief executive and ceremonial head. The elected deputy of the rector is known as pro-rector ({{lang-no|prorektor}}). Some institutions also have vice rectors, who are appointed by the rector and subordinate to the rector and pro-rector. \n\nTraditionally, Norwegian universities and colleges had democratic elections for the rector and pro-rector positions. Since 2016, the institutions may choose to have an elected or an appointed rector <ref>https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-04-01-15/\u00a710-2</ref>. Universities and colleges usually have a ''university director'' or ''college director'', who is the head of the administration (i.e., the non-academic employees) and subordinate to the rectorate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]], the rector ({{lang-pl|rektor}}) is the elected head of a university or university college, in military, military type upper educaction institutions name of rector like official is ({{lang-pl|komendant}}) (commander). The rector is the highest official of the [[university]]. Rector of the university can be a person with at least a [[doctor (title)|doctoral]] degree, employed by the university as the main place of work. Rector is referred to as Jego/Jej Magnificencja (en. His/Her Magnificence) (abbreviation: JM). The outfit of rector is red or purple coat (robe) with [[ermine]] fur, often with a [[scepter]] and a decorative string of symbols of the university. Deputy rectors ({{lang-pl|prorektor}}) at official ceremonies are dressed in the same [[gown]], but with fewer decorations (usually without the fur). Rectors of military universities wear only an officer's uniform and a necklace with symbols of the university.\n\nAs of 2008, the term of office of the rector of public universities lasts for 4 years (previously 3 years), beginning on 1 September in an election year and ending on 31 August of the year in which the term ends. A person may not be elected to serve as rector for more than two consecutive terms. In the case of private universities the rule is regulated by [[university]] statute.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]], the rector ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Reitor'') is the highest official of each university. The title of the rector of the universities whose foundation has been historically approved by the Pope, as the University of Coimbra, the Univ. of \u00c9vora or, in modern times, the Catholic University, is called ''Magn\u00edfico Reitor'' (Magnificus Rector, as the rector was called in the Latin documents). Each university faculty is headed by a director or a president of the directorate council, and the rector heads all of them.\n\nUntil 1974, the director of each [[Lyceum#Portugal|Lyceum]] (high school) also had the title of Rector.\n\n===Russia===\nIn [[Russia]], the rector ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''\u0420\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440'') as a term for a university chancellor introduced in 1961.

Formally styled as ''Excelent\u00edsimo e Ilustr\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or Profesor Doctor Don N, Rector Magn\u00edfico de la Universidad de X'' (\"Most Excellent and Illustrious Lord Professor Doctor Don N, Rector Magnificus of the University of X\"), it is an office of high dignity within Spanish society, usually being highly respected. It is not strange to see them appear in the media, especially when some academic-related subject is being discussed and their opinion is requested.\n\nSpanish rectors are chosen from within the body of university full [[professor]]s (''Catedr\u00e1ticos'' in Spanish); it is compulsory for anyone aspiring to become a rector to have been a doctor for at least six years before his election, and to have achieved professor status, holding it in the same university for which he is running. Usually, when running for election, the rector will need to have chosen the vice-rectors (''vicerrectores'' in Spanish), who will occupy several sub-offices in the university. Rectors are elected directly by free and secret universal suffrage of all the members of the university, including students, lecturers, readers, researchers, and civil servants. However, the weight of the vote in each academic sector is different: the total student vote usually represents 20% of the whole, no matter how many students there are; the votes of the entire group made up of professors and readers (members of what used to be known as the ''Claustro'' (''[[cloister]]'')) usually count for about 40-50% of the total; lecturers, researchers (including Ph.D. students and others) and non-doctoral teachers, about 20% of the total; and the remainder (usually some 5-10%) is left for non-scholarly workers (people in administration, etc.) in the university. Spanish law allows those percentages to be changed according to the situation of each university, or even not to have a direct election system. Indeed, in a few universities the Rector is chosen indirectly; the members of the modern ''Claustro'' (a sort of electoral college or parliament in which all the above-mentioned groups are represented) is chosen first, and then the Claustro selects the Rector.\n\nRectors hold their office for four years before another election is held, and there is no limit to the number of re-election terms. However, only the most charismatic and respected rectors have been able to hold their office for more than two or three terms. Of those, some have been notable [[Spanish people|Spanish]] scholars, such as [[Basque people|Basque]] writer [[Miguel de Unamuno]], Rector of the [[University of Salamanca]] from 1901 until 1936.\n\n===Sweden===\n''Rektor'' is the title for the highest-ranked administrative and educational leader for an academic institution, such as a primary school, secondary school, private school, high school, college or university. The ''rektors'' of state-run colleges and universities are formally appointed by the government, i.e. the cabinet, but upon the advice of the concerned institution's board, and usually following some sort of democratic process at the concerned institution. The adjunct of a ''rektor'' at a university is called a ''prorektor'' and is appointed by the institution's board.\n\nIn the older universities, [[Uppsala university]] and [[Lund university]], the ''rektor'' is titled ''rector magnificus'' (men), or ''rectrix magnifica'' (women). Younger universities have in more recent years started using the Latin honorary title in formal situations, such as in honorary speeches or graduation ceremonies.\n\nThe University Chancellor of Sweden was until 2017 the title of the head of the government accrediting agency, the [[National Agency for Higher Education]]. From 2017, this position carries the title Director General which is the usual title of the head of a government agency. The people recruited to the position have in later times always been former vice-chancellors (presidents) of a Swedish university. The position does not include leadership of a university.\n\n===Switzerland===\nThe heads of the [[universities in Switzerland]], usually elected by the college of professors, are titled rector (''Rektor'', ''recteur'').\n\n===Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey===\nThe rector is the head of most universities and other higher educational institutions in at least parts of Central and Eastern Europe, such as Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Poland, Romania, Russia, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, Hungary and Ukraine. The rector's deputies are known as \"pro-rectors\". Individual departments of a university (called [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]) are headed by [[Dean (education)|deans]].\n\n==North America==\n\n===Canada===\nAs in most Commonwealth and British-influenced countries, the term \"rector\" is not commonly used in Canada.\n\nQuebec's universities, both francophone (e.g., ''[[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]]'') and anglophone (e.g., [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]), use the term (''recteur'' or ''rectrice'' in French) to designate the head of the institution.  In addition, the historically French-Catholic, and now bilingual, [[Saint Paul University]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario uses the term to denote its head.  St. Paul's College, the Roman Catholic College of the University of Manitoba, uses the term 'rector' to designate the head of the College.  St. Boniface College, the French College of the University of Manitoba, uses 'recteur' or 'rectrice' to designate the head of the College.\n\nAt the bilingual [[University of Ottawa]], the term president has been used since 2008, but before that time rector was used for the English name; however, ''recteur'' (or ''rectrice'') continues to be used as the French term for the head of the university.\n\n[[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] ([[Kingston, Ontario]]) uses the term \"rector\".  The term refers to a member of the student body elected to work as an equal with the [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] and [[Principal (university)|principal]]. The Badge of Office of the Rector of Queen's University was registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on 15 October 2004.<ref>http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=511 Badge of Office</ref> See [[List of Rectors of Queen's University]]. [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] also use the title.\n\n===United States===\nMost U.S. colleges do not use the term \"rector.\" The terms \"president\" and \"chancellor\" are often used for the chief executive of universities and university systems, depending on the institution's statutes or governing documents. Some state university systems have both \"presidents\" of the constituent institutions and a \"chancellor\" of the overall system, or vice versa; for example, in the [[University of California|University of California system]], each of the ten campuses is headed by a chancellor, while the leader of the system is given the title \"president.\" Colleges and universities, or state systems, also typically have [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States|governing boards]] (akin to a [[board of directors]]), which may be referred to by a variety of names, including \"board of trustees\" and \"board of regents,\" and which are usually led by a chairperson.\n\n\"Rector\" is commonly used in [[Virginia]], however. The [[University of Virginia]] ([[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]), [[University of Mary Washington]] ([[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]), [[George Mason University]] ([[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]]), [[Virginia State University]] ([[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]]), [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] ([[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]), [[Longwood University]] ([[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]]), [[Washington and Lee University]] ([[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]]), the [[College of William and Mary]] ([[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]), [[Old Dominion University]] ([[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]), [[Christopher Newport University]] ([[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]), and [[Virginia Tech]] ([[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]]) all use the term \"Rector\" to designate the presiding officer of the [[Board of Visitors]] (or \"Board of Trustees,\" in the case of Washington and Lee). [[Thomas Jefferson]] served as the first rector of the University of Virginia, beginning in 1819, and intended that the school would not have a president; it lacked that position until 1904.\n\nFrom 1701-1745, the head of the school that was to become [[Yale University]] was termed the \"rector\".  As head of [[Yale College]], [[Thomas Clap]] was both the last to be called \"rector\" (1740\u20131745) and the first to be referred to as president (1745\u20131766).  Modern custom omits the use of the term \"rector\" and identifies [[Abraham Pierson]] as the first Yale president (1701\u20131707), making Clap the fifth of Yale's leaders, regardless of title.<ref>Welch, Lewis ''et al.'' (1899). [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8wWAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA301&dq=Yale+and+Noah+Porter&lr=&client=firefox-a#PPA445,M1 ''Yale, Her Campus, Class-rooms, and Athletics,'' p. 445.]</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] colleges and universities, particularly those run by [[Catholic religious order|religious orders of priests]] (such as the [[Jesuits]]) used to employ the term \"rector\" to refer to the school's chief officer. In many cases, the rector was also the head of the community of priests assigned to the school, so the two posts &ndash; head of the university and local superior of the priests &ndash; were merged in the role of rector (''See \"Ecclesiastical rectors\" below''). This practice is no longer followed, as the details of the governance of most of these schools have changed.  At the [[University of Notre Dame]], the title \"rector\" is used for those in charge of individual [[List of residence halls at the University of Notre Dame|residence halls]].\n\nSome American high schools also have a rector; for example, at [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[New Hampshire]], the Rector is equivalent to a [[Head teacher|Headmaster]] (head of the school).\n\n==Australia==\nThe term \"rector\" is uncommon in Australian academic institutions. The executive head of an Australian university has traditionally been given the British title Vice-Chancellor, although in recent times the American term President has also been adopted. The term rector is used by some academic institutions, such as the University of Melbourne residential college, Newman College; the private boys' school, Xavier College; and the University of Sydney residential college, St John's College (Benedictine).\n\nThe title rector is sometimes used for the head of a subordinate and geographically separate campus of a university.  For example, the executive head of the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in Canberra, which is a campus of the [[University of New South Wales]] in Sydney is a Rector, as is the head of the Cairns campus of [[James Cook University]], based at Townsville.\n\n==New Zealand==\nThe title is used in New Zealand for the [[headmaster]] of some independent schools, such as [[Lindisfarne College, New Zealand|Lindisfarne College]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream]], as well as a number of state schools for boys, including [[Otago Boys' High School]], [[King's High School, Dunedin]], [[Waitaki Boys' High School]], [[Timaru Boys' High School]], [[Palmerston North Boys' High School]] and [[Southland Boys' High School]] showing the Scots' involvement in the foundation of those schools.\n\n== Africa ==\n\n=== Mauritius ===\nIn Mauritius the term 'rector' is used to designate the head of a secondary school.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Asia==\n\n===India===\nThe heads of certain Indian [[boarding school]]s are called rectors. The head or principal of a Catholic school in India is also called a rector.\n===Indonesia===\nRector is the highest executive post in universities in Indonesia. At a public university, university senate members select a pool three candidates for the education minister to decide the rector from. Except for autonomous public university (PTN-BH), rector was elected by university board of trustees. The final decision is not necessarily the one with the majority of the university senate's votes.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/09/nearly-100-years-after-its-founding-itb-names-first-female-rector.html|title=Nearly 100 years after its founding, ITB names first female rector|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:YushimaSeido8678.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Colonnade at the reconstructed ''[[Yushima Seid\u014d]]'' in Tokyo.

The rector of the ''Yushima Seid\u014d'' stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained with the personal involvement of successive sh\u014dguns.  The position as rector of the ''Yushima Seid\u014d'' became hereditary in the [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi family]].<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard A.B. (1956).

A ''Rektor'' is comparable to the position of ''Naib Canselor'', or vice-chancellor, in other higher education institutions, as the ''Rektor'' answers to the ''[[Chancellor (education)|Canselor]]''.\n\n===Myanmar===\nThe term ''rector'' ([[Burmese language|Burmese]]:''\u1015\u102b\u1019\u1031\u102c\u1000\u103a\u1001\u1001\u103b\u102f\u1015\u103a'') is used to refer to the highest official of universities in [[Myanmar]]. Each university department is headed by a professor, who is responsible to the rector. Nowadays, given the large dimensions of some universities, the position of pro-rector has emerged, just below that of the rector. Pro-rectors are in charge of managing particular areas of the university, such as research or [[undergraduate education]].\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe heads of certain universities and colleges such as [[National University of Sciences & Technology]], [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology]], [[Forman Christian College]], [[Virtual University of Pakistan]], [[COMSATS Institute of Information Technology]] and PIEAS are all titled \"Rector\".\n\n===Philippines===\n[[File:Rector Herminio Dagohoy of Santo Tomas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herminio Dagohoy]], the 96th Rector Magnificus of the [[University of Santo Tomas|Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas]], Manila]]\n{{See also|Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas}}\nThe term ''rector'' or ''Rector Magnificus'' is used to refer to the highest official in prominent Catholic universities and colleges such as the [[University of Santo Tomas|University of Santo Tom\u00e1s]], the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letr\u00e1n]], and the [[San Beda University]]. The rector typically sits as chair of the university board of trustees. He exercises policy-making, general academic, managerial, and religious functions over all university academic and non-academic staff.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, on 20 May 1865, a royal order from Queen Isabella II gave the [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas]] the power to direct and supervise all the educational institutions in the Philippines and thus, the Rector of the University became the ''ex officio'' head of the secondary and higher education in the Philippines. All diplomas issued by other schools were approved by the Rector of the University and examinations leading to the issuance of such diplomas were supervised by the professors of the University of Santo Tomas.<ref name=varsi>[http://www.varsitarian.net/supplement/rectors_supplement/history_of_the_rectorship http://www.varsitarian.net/supplement/rectors_supplement/history_of_the_rectorship] ''The Varsitarian website'' Accessed 4 August 2012</ref><ref name=ust>[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/history.html History of the University of Santo Tomas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222000856/http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/history.html |date=22 December 2009 }} ''The University of Santo Tomas website'' Accessed 4 August 2012</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\nThe term ''rector'' is not widely used to refer to the highest executive position in Thai universities ([[Thai language|Thai]]:''\u0e2d\u0e18\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35''; {{RTGS|Athikan Bodi}} ), compared to the term ''president''. [[Thammasat University]] adopts this term for this position to reflect its tradition associated with the French education system where [[Pridi Banomyong]], Thammasat's founding father was educated.\n\nExcept [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]], the only International Catholic University in Thailand, the position of the head of the executives and administrators of the institute is \"rector\". A decade after the present rector assume his duty, the title of Rector Magnificus was bestowed on Rev. Bro. Bancha Saenghiran, f.s.g., Ph.D. at a solemn Academic ceremony on 1 November 2011 at the Assumption University Suvarnabhumi campus in the ornate Chapel of St. Louis Marie de Montfort (founder of the [[Louis de Montfort|Montfortian Brothers of St. Gabriel]].)\n\n==South America==\n\n===Argentina===\nThe term ''rector'' is used to refer to the highest official of universities, and university-owned high schools (e.g., [[Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini]]) in [[Argentina]]. Each faculty ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]:''Facultad'') has its own dean.\n\n===Brazil===\nThe term ''rector'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Reitor'') is used to refer to the highest official of universities in [[Brazil]]. Each faculty is headed by a director, who is under the authority of the rector. Nowadays, given the large size of some universities, the position of pro-rector has emerged below that of the rector. The pro-rector is in charge of managing a particular area of the university, such as research or [[undergraduate education]].\n\n==Compound titles==\nA rector who has resigned is often given the title ''rector [[emeritus]]''. One who temporarily performs the functions usually fulfilled by a rector is styled a ''pro-rector'' (in parishes, administrator).\n\nDeputies of rectors in institutions are known as ''vice-rector''s (in parishes, as curates, assistant - or associate rectors, etc.). In some universities the title vice-rector has, like [[vice-chancellor]] in many Anglo-Saxon cases, been used for the de facto head when the essentially honorary title of rector is reserved for a high externa dignitary; until 1920, there was such a ''vice-recteur'' at the Parisian [[Sorbonne]] as the French Minister of Education was its nominal ''recteur''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chancellor (education)]]\n* [[Dean (education)]]\n* [[Prorector]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Rector}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rector}}\n\n[[Category:Academic administration]]\n[[Category:Heads of universities and colleges| ]]\n", "name_user": "Hnhtag", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMyanmar:fix burmese spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(academia)"}
