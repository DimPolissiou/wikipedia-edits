Island and [[A&M Records]], another label recently acquired by PolyGram, were both at the time the largest [[independent record label]]s in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive music scene in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s.\n\nIsland Records operates four international divisions: Island UK, Island US, Island Australia, and Island France (known as Vertigo France until 2014).

The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nBlackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as [[John Martyn]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and greatly influenced the growing [[FM radio]] market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including [[Roxy Music]], [[King Crimson]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Steve Winwood]] and many others.  (In the US, many of their releases were issued on A&M prior to Island signing up an unsuccessful distribution deal with Capitol. After that failed, Island was largely an independently distributed label in the US.)\n\nFor [[Toots and the Maytals]], the group that introduced the term \"[[reggae]]\" in song with their 1968 single \"[[Do the Reggay]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reggae |title=reggae |publisher=Dictionary.com Unabridged.

Blackwell had signed [[Bob Marley]], and now Toots and the Maytals. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.kool97fm.com T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan].

First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: [[Toots Hibbert|Toots]], Raleigh, and Jerry. ... And then they were signed to Island Records, Chris Blackwell. And we were their recording band. One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:\n\n<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ... [I began] reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid, sometimes dangerous, always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cool\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1983, the film production company formed a partnership with [[Shep Gordon]]'s Alive Enterprises to form Island Alive and had success with ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'', and ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''.<ref name=IA/> The partnership was dissolved in 1985.<ref name=IA/> In August 1987, the company was not able to pay a US$5 million sum that it owed to U2 in royalties for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' album, as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films. U2 responded by negotiating a deal whereby they invested the unpaid royalties into the company in exchange for a stake in the company that was estimated to be around 10 per cent.<ref>{{Cite book | last = McGee | first = Matt | title = U2:A Diary | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84772-108-2}}</ref>\n\nThe label's [[4th & Broadway]] division, operating since the mid-1980s, achieved some success marketing alternative [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and dance-pop music with artists such as [[Eric B. & Rakim|Eric B. and Rakim]] and the [[Stereo MCs]].

These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure.

The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nBlackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]).

One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals.

The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label's creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Manga Entertainment==\nIsland World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991.

Odisha has also been the home of the Kalinga, Utkal, Mahakantara/Kantara and Kosal that played a particularly prominent role in the region's history, and one of the earliest references to the ancient Kalingas appears in the writings of Vedic chroniclers.[Refernce-Odisha Familypedia].\nOdia is an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]].

Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.\n\n[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.\n\nFour writers in Odia \u2013 [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] \u2013 have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.\n\n== Language sample ==\nThe first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Odia:\n\u0b05\u0b28\u0b41\u0b1a\u0b4d\u0b1b\u0b47\u0b26 \u0b0f\u0b15:\u0b38\u0b2c\u0b41 \u0b2e\u0b28\u0b41\u0b37\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b1c\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b2e\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b30\u0b41 \u0b38\u0b4d\u0b71\u0b3e\u0b27\u0b40\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b30 \u0b2e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f\u0b3e\u0b26\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b05\u0b27\u0b3f\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30 \u0b38\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b20\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b1c\u0b4d\u0b1e\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b2c\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b47\u0b15 \u0b28\u0b3f\u0b39\u0b3f\u0b24 \u0b05\u0b1b\u0b3f\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b30\u0b38\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b30 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b24\u0b3f \u0b2d\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b3e\u0b24\u0b43\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b2c \u0b2a\u0b4b\u0b37\u0b23 \u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b15\u0b30\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b3e \u0b26\u0b30\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0964\n:[[File:Universal Declaration of Human Rights - ori - ra - Art1.ogg]]\n:''All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.\n\n[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.\n\nFour writers in Odia \u2013 [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] \u2013 have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.\n\n== Language sample ==\nThe first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Odia:\n\u0b05\u0b28\u0b41\u0b1a\u0b4d\u0b1b\u0b47\u0b26 \u0b0f\u0b15:\u0b38\u0b2c\u0b41 \u0b2e\u0b28\u0b41\u0b37\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b1c\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b2e\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b30\u0b41 \u0b38\u0b4d\u0b71\u0b3e\u0b27\u0b40\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b30 \u0b2e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f\u0b3e\u0b26\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b05\u0b27\u0b3f\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30 \u0b38\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b20\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b1c\u0b4d\u0b1e\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b2c\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b47\u0b15 \u0b28\u0b3f\u0b39\u0b3f\u0b24 \u0b05\u0b1b\u0b3f\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b30\u0b38\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b30 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b24\u0b3f \u0b2d\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b3e\u0b24\u0b43\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b2c \u0b2a\u0b4b\u0b37\u0b23 \u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b15\u0b30\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b3e \u0b26\u0b30\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0964\n:[[File:Universal Declaration of Human Rights - ori - ra - Art1.ogg]]\n:''All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

An [[river island|island in a river]] or a [[lake island]] may be called an [[ait|eyot or ait]], and a small island off the coast may be called a [[holm (island)|holm]]. Sedimentary islands in the [[Ganges delta]] are called [[List of islands of Bangladesh|chars]]. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the [[Philippines]], is referred to as an [[archipelago]].\n\nAn island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are [[Singapore]] and its [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|causeway]], and the various [[Netherlands|Dutch]] delta islands, such as [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]]. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as [[Coney Island]] and [[Coronado, California|Coronado Island]], though these are, strictly speaking, [[tied island]]s. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the [[mainland]] by a man-made canal, for example the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Corinth Canal]], more or less the entirety of [[Fennoscandia]] by the [[White Sea Canal]], or [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in northern [[Manhattan]] during the time between the building of the [[United States Ship Canal]] and the filling-in of the [[Harlem River]] which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.\n\nThere are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic.

Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].\n\nAnother subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:\n\n* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves\n* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves.

University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions.

A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the [[Philippines]], is referred to as an [[archipelago]].\n\nAn island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are [[Singapore]] and its [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|causeway]], and the various [[Netherlands|Dutch]] delta islands, such as [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]]. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as [[Coney Island]] and [[Coronado, California|Coronado Island]], though these are, strictly speaking, [[tied island]]s. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the [[mainland]] by a man-made canal, for example the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Corinth Canal]], more or less the entirety of [[Fennoscandia]] by the [[White Sea Canal]], or [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in northern [[Manhattan]] during the time between the building of the [[United States Ship Canal]] and the filling-in of the [[Harlem River]] which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.\n\nThere are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic.

Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].\n\nAnother subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:\n\n* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves\n* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.)

University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions.
