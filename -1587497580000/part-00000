When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

|url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/108/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8, [[Ant-Man]] and [[Dragon Man]] give pink-haired rock star turned reluctant superhero Darla Deering her own Thing Rings to summon Ben Grimm's old rocky Thing-bodied [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]

In the north, the plateau is connected to a neighbouring mountain range by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''Sie bauten die ersten Tempel. Das r\u00e4tselhafte Heiligtum der Steinzeitj\u00e4ger. Die arch\u00e4ologische Entdeckung am G\u00f6bekli Tepe.'' Munich 2006, p. 102.</ref> On top of the ridge there is considerable evidence of human impact, in addition to the construction of the tell. Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south and west of a [[mulberry]] that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995\u20132007''. In: ''Erste Tempel - Fr\u00fche Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur. Ausgrabungen und Forschungen zwischen Donau und Euphrat. Oldenburg 2009, p. 188.</ref> but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools.\n\n===Plateau===\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area.JPG|thumb|left|G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-20.jpg|thumb|left|Complex E]]\n[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 2 from Enclosure A (Layer III) with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[crane (bird)|crane]]]]\n\nThe plateau has been transformed by erosion and by [[quarry]]ing, which took place not only in the Neolithic, but also in classical times. There are four {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|20|cm|in|adj=mid|-wide}} channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These possibly are related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably this is the remains of a Roman [[watchtower]] that was part of the [[Limes Arabicus]], however, this is conjecture.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\">Schmidt 2006, p. 105</ref>\n\nMost structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\"/> Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3&nbsp;metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=on}} and its head has a width of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}}. Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.\n\n===Tell===\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, [[flint]] and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was therefore suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 109\u2013111</ref> It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three [[phallus|phallic]] depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\">Schmidt 2006, p. 111</ref>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars, and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the complexes from Layer&nbsp;III at the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex&nbsp;E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]] it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the [[terrazzo]] floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that is believed to be part of complex&nbsp;E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.<ref>Schmidt 2006, p. 109</ref>\n\nAt the western [[escarpment]], a small cave has been discovered in which a small [[relief]] depicting a [[bovid]] was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\" />\n\n===Layer III===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| direction =horizontal\n| header=Animal sculpture (ca. 9,000 BC)\n| total_width=400\n| image1   = GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg\n| image2   = Gobeklitepe_animal_sculpture,_circa_9000_BCE.jpg\n| footer=<center>Pillar 27 from Enclosure C (Layer III) with the sculpture of a predatory animal in high relief catching a prey in low relief.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Sharon R. |last2=McMahon |first2=Gregory |title=The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia: (10,000-323 BCE) |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |isbn=9780195376142 |page=923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY3t4y_L5SQC&pg=PA923 |language=en}}</ref></center>\n}}\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds or ''[[Temenos|temene]]'' first appear. They range from 10 to 30 metres in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 metres (330&nbsp;ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.<ref>Schmidt 2000b, pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe Pillar.JPG|thumb|left|Pillar with the sculpture of a fox]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-3.jpg|thumb|left|Monolith with possible bird figures.]]\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.<ref>Mithen 2004, p. 65</ref> Many of the pillars are decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from [[Neolithic]] [[cave paintings]] elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; [[arthropod]]s such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013[[Dust Bowl]] conditions prevalent today.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] and [[Jericho]].\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 244, 246</ref> Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of [[terrazzo]] (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.<ref>Schmidt, 2010, p. 251.</ref> Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles in the range of 9600 to 8800 BCE. Carbon dating suggests that (for reasons unknown) the enclosures were backfilled during the Stone Age.\n\n===Layer II===\n[[File:\u015eanl\u0131urfa M\u00fczesi Neotilik \u00c7a\u011f totem.jpg|thumb|upright|A sort of [[totem pole]] from G\u00f6bekli Tepe, with portions of humanoid figures. Layer II, 8800\u20138000 BCE - [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum|\u015eanl\u0131urfa (Urfa) Museum]]]]\n\nCreation of the circular enclosures in layer III later gave way to the construction of small rectangular rooms in layer II. Rectangular buildings make a more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,<ref>Flannery and Marcus, ''The Creation of Inequality'', p. 128</ref> but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings of Layer II continued to serve the same function in the culture, presumably as sanctuaries.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 239, 241.</ref> Layer II is assigned to [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.<ref>Schmidt 2009, p. 291</ref> Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.<ref>Schmidt 1990, p. 198</ref>\n\nA stone pillar resembling totem pole designs was discovered at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Layer II in 2010. It is 1.92 metres high, and is superficially reminiscent of the totem poles in North America. The pole features three figures, the uppermost depicting a predator, probably a bear, and below it a human-like shape. Because the statue is damaged, the interpretation is not entirely clear. Fragments of a similar pole also were discovered about 20 years ago in another Turkey site at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]]. Also, an older layer at Gobekli features some related sculptures portraying animals on human heads.<ref>[https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/the-gobekli-tepe-totem-pole/ The G\u00f6bekli Tepe \u2018Totem Pole\u2019.] News & Notes from the G\u00f6bekli Tepe Research Staff - 2017-03-01</ref>\n\n===Layer I===\n\n[[File:UrfaMuseumG\u00f6bekli.jpg|thumb|Steles and sculptures from G\u00f6bekli Tepe in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum]].]]\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-27.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of a wild boar, G\u00f6bekli Tepe, 9000 BCE]]\n\nLayer I is the uppermost part of the hill. It is the shallowest, but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\nThe site was deliberately [[Earthworks (engineering)|backfilled]] sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones.<ref>Schmidt 2010, p. 242</ref> In addition to [[Byblos]] points (weapon heads, such as arrowheads etc.) and numerous [[Nemrik]] points, [[Helwan]]-points, and [[Tell Aswad|Aswad]]-points dominate the backfill's lithic inventory.\n\n==Chronological context==\nAll statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has been excavated, and Schmidt planned to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations when archaeological techniques will presumably have improved.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> While the site formally belongs to the earliest Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]]), to date no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are presumed to have been [[hunters and gatherers]] who nevertheless lived in villages for at least part of the year.<ref>The Guardian report 23 April 2008</ref> So far, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at about 9000 BCE (see above), but it is hypothesized by some archaeologists{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} that the elevated location may have functioned as a spiritual center during 10,000 BCE or earlier, essentially, at the very end of the [[Pleistocene]].\n\nThe surviving structures, then, not only predate [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and the invention of writing or the wheel, but were built before the [[Neolithic Revolution]], that marks the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], around 9000 BCE. The construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies, however. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local [[quarry|quarries]] and move them {{convert|100|-|500|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} to the site.<ref>{{cite web| title= Which came first, monumental building projects or farming? |work=Archaeo News |date= 14 December 2008 | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/003061.html}}</ref> The pillars weigh {{convert|10|-|20|MT|lk=out|0}}, with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taracha|first=Piotr|title=Religions of second millennium Anatolia|year=2009|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-3-447-05885-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTE7o8aKI7IC&pg=PA12&dq=%22G%C3%B6bekli+Tepe%22+%2250+tons%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=12}}</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE G\u00f6bekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" (Schmidt's phrase applied particularly to Layer III, Enclosure D) apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities. However, the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as {{convert|300|to|500|m3|cuyd|-1|sp=us}} of refuse, creating a tell consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools. Many animal, and even human, bones have been identified in the fill.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 242\u2013243, 249.</ref> Why the enclosures were buried is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Klaus Schmidt Monumento 2014 5.jpg|thumb|Klaus Schmidt, 2014 in Salzburg]]\nSchmidt's view was that G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a stone-age mountain sanctuary. [[Radiocarbon dating]] as well as comparative, stylistical analysis indicate that it is the oldest known temple yet discovered anywhere.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/><ref name=\"ArchMag\">{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov\u2013Dec 2008 | page=23}}</ref> Schmidt believed that what he called this \"cathedral on a hill\" was a pilgrimage destination attracting worshippers up to {{convert|150|km|abbr=on|-1}} distant. Butchered bones found in large numbers from local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, 207</ref>\n\nSchmidt considered G\u00f6bekli Tepe a central location for a [[Veneration of the dead|cult of the dead]] and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Though no tombs or graves have yet been found, Schmidt believed that graves remain to be discovered in niches located behind the walls of the sacred circles.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/>\n\nIn 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions was reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult.<ref>Julia Gresky, Juliane Haelm and Lee Clare, \"Modified human crania from G\u00f6bekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult\", ''Science Advances'', Vol. 3, no. 6, 28 Jun 2017.

Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on [[Karaca Da\u011f]] {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated.<ref>Heun et al., ''Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting'', Science, 278 (1997) 1312\u201314.</ref>\n\nWith its mountains catching the rain and a calcareous, porous bedrock creating lots of springs, creeks, and rivers,<ref name=\":2\" /> the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris was a refuge during the dry and cold [[Younger Dryas]] climatic event (10,800 \u2013 9,500 BCE){{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.

He presumed [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in [[Mesopotamia]], that was associated with extensive [[temple]]s and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient [[Sumer]]ian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain [[Ekur]], which was inhabited by [[Annuna]] deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 216\u2013221</ref> It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /><ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 193\u2013194; 218.</ref><ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, p. 209</ref> Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the G\u00f6bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.<ref>Dragos Gheorghiu (2015); ''A river runs through it.

Some researchers believe that the construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe may have contributed to the later development of urban civilization, or, as excavator Klaus Schmidt put it, \"First came the temple, then the city.\"<ref>K. Schmidt 2000: \"Zuerst kam der Tempel, dann die Stadt.\"</ref>\n[[File:T-shaped-pillars-PPN.jpg|thumb|Sites with T-shaped pillars from the PPN]]\nIn addition to its large dimensions, the side-by-side existence of multiple pillar shrines makes the location unique.

Since its discovery, however, surface surveys have shown that several hills in the greater area also have T-shaped stone pillars (e.g. Hamzan Tepe,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/37.22/1714|title=Hamzan Tepe in the light of new finds|last=\u00c7elik|first=Bahattin|date=2010|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Karahan Tepe,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/38.19/1651|title=Karahan Tepe: a new cultural centre in the Urfa Area in Turkey|last=\u00c7elik|first=Bahattin|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Harbetsuvan Tepesi,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/43.21|title=A small-scale cult centre in Southeast Turkey: Harbetsuvan Tepesi|last=\u00c7elik|first=Bahattin|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Sefer Tepe,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/14/1790/18894.pdf|title=New pre-pottery neolithic settlements from Viran\u015fehir District|last=G\u00fcler, \u00c7elik, G\u00fcler|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and Tasl\u0131 Tepe<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/40.23/817|title=New Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites and cult centres in the Urfa Region|last=G\u00fcler, \u00c7elik, G\u00fcler|date=2013|website=|access-date=}}</ref>) but little excavation has been conducted.

It was excavated by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and has been submerged by the [[Atat\u00fcrk Dam]] since 1992. Its T-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its rectangular ceremonial structure was located inside a village. The roughly contemporary architecture at [[Jericho]] is devoid of artistic merit or large-scale sculpture, and [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]], perhaps the most famous Anatolian Neolithic village, is 2,000 years later.\n\nAt present G\u00f6bekli Tepe appears to raise more questions for archaeology and prehistory than it answers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} It remains unknown how a population large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and compensated or fed in the conditions of pre-sedentary society. Scholars have been unable to interpret the pictograms, and do not know what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there is little or no evidence of habitation, and many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to [[Apotropaic magic|stave off evils]] through some form of magic representation. Alternatively, they could have served as [[totem]]s.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004: pp. 209\u2013212</ref> The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"<ref>Banning 2011</ref> It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.<ref>Mann, June 2011, p. 48</ref> Human burials may have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was carefully backfilled remains unexplained. Based on current evidence, it is difficult to deduce anything certain about the originating culture or the site's significance.\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe site (2).JPG|thumb|G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]\nFuture plans include construction of a museum and converting the environs into an archaeological park, in the hope that this will help preserve the site in the state in which it was discovered.<ref>K.

He reviewed the archaeological literature on the surrounding area, found the 1963 Chicago researchers\u2019 brief description of G\u00f6bekli Tepe, and decided to reexamine the site. Having found similar structures at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, he recognized the possibility that the rocks and slabs were prehistoric.

In the north, the plateau is connected to a neighbouring mountain range by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''Sie bauten die ersten Tempel. Das r\u00e4tselhafte Heiligtum der Steinzeitj\u00e4ger. Die arch\u00e4ologische Entdeckung am G\u00f6bekli Tepe.'' Munich 2006, p. 102.</ref> On top of the ridge there is considerable evidence of human impact, in addition to the construction of the tell. Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south and west of a [[mulberry]] that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995\u20132007''. In: ''Erste Tempel - Fr\u00fche Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur. Ausgrabungen und Forschungen zwischen Donau und Euphrat. Oldenburg 2009, p. 188.</ref> but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools.\n\n===Plateau===\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area.JPG|thumb|left|G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-20.jpg|thumb|left|Complex E]]\n[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 2 from Enclosure A (Layer III) with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[crane (bird)|crane]]]]\n\nThe plateau has been transformed by erosion and by [[quarry]]ing, which took place not only in the Neolithic, but also in classical times. There are four {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|20|cm|in|adj=mid|-wide}} channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These possibly are related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably this is the remains of a Roman [[watchtower]] that was part of the [[Limes Arabicus]], however, this is conjecture.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\">Schmidt 2006, p. 105</ref>\n\nMost structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\"/> Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3&nbsp;metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=on}} and its head has a width of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}}. Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.\n\n===Tell===\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, [[flint]] and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was therefore suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 109\u2013111</ref> It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three [[phallus|phallic]] depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\">Schmidt 2006, p. 111</ref>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars, and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the complexes from Layer&nbsp;III at the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex&nbsp;E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]] it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the [[terrazzo]] floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that is believed to be part of complex&nbsp;E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.<ref>Schmidt 2006, p. 109</ref>\n\nAt the western [[escarpment]], a small cave has been discovered in which a small [[relief]] depicting a [[bovid]] was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\" />\n\n===Layer III===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| direction =horizontal\n| header=Animal sculpture (ca. 9,000 BC)\n| total_width=400\n| image1   = GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg\n| image2   = Gobeklitepe_animal_sculpture,_circa_9000_BCE.jpg\n| footer=<center>Pillar 27 from Enclosure C (Layer III) with the sculpture of a predatory animal in high relief catching a prey in low relief.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Sharon R. |last2=McMahon |first2=Gregory |title=The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia: (10,000-323 BCE) |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |isbn=9780195376142 |page=923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY3t4y_L5SQC&pg=PA923 |language=en}}</ref></center>\n}}\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds or ''[[Temenos|temene]]'' first appear. They range from 10 to 30 metres in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 metres (330&nbsp;ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.<ref>Schmidt 2000b, pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe Pillar.JPG|thumb|left|Pillar with the sculpture of a fox]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-3.jpg|thumb|left|Monolith with possible bird figures.]]\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.<ref>Mithen 2004, p. 65</ref> Many of the pillars are decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from [[Neolithic]] [[cave paintings]] elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; [[arthropod]]s such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013[[Dust Bowl]] conditions prevalent today.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] and [[Jericho]].\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 244, 246</ref> Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of [[terrazzo]] (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.<ref>Schmidt, 2010, p. 251.</ref> Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles in the range of 9600 to 8800 BCE. Carbon dating suggests that (for reasons unknown) the enclosures were backfilled during the Stone Age.\n\n===Layer II===\n[[File:\u015eanl\u0131urfa M\u00fczesi Neotilik \u00c7a\u011f totem.jpg|thumb|upright|A sort of [[totem pole]] from G\u00f6bekli Tepe, with portions of humanoid figures. Layer II, 8800\u20138000 BCE - [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum|\u015eanl\u0131urfa (Urfa) Museum]]]]\n\nCreation of the circular enclosures in layer III later gave way to the construction of small rectangular rooms in layer II. Rectangular buildings make a more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,<ref>Flannery and Marcus, ''The Creation of Inequality'', p. 128</ref> but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings of Layer II continued to serve the same function in the culture, presumably as sanctuaries.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 239, 241.</ref> Layer II is assigned to [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.<ref>Schmidt 2009, p. 291</ref> Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.<ref>Schmidt 1990, p. 198</ref>\n\nA stone pillar resembling totem pole designs was discovered at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Layer II in 2010. It is 1.92 metres high, and is superficially reminiscent of the totem poles in North America. The pole features three figures, the uppermost depicting a predator, probably a bear, and below it a human-like shape. Because the statue is damaged, the interpretation is not entirely clear. Fragments of a similar pole also were discovered about 20 years ago in another Turkey site at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]].

It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\nThe site was deliberately [[Earthworks (engineering)|backfilled]] sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones.<ref>Schmidt 2010, p. 242</ref> In addition to [[Byblos]] points (weapon heads, such as arrowheads etc.) and numerous [[Nemrik]] points, [[Helwan]]-points, and [[Tell Aswad|Aswad]]-points dominate the backfill's lithic inventory.\n\n==Chronological context==\nAll statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has been excavated, and Schmidt planned to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations when archaeological techniques will presumably have improved.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> While the site formally belongs to the earliest Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]]), to date no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are presumed to have been [[hunters and gatherers]] who nevertheless lived in villages for at least part of the year.<ref>The Guardian report 23 April 2008</ref> So far, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at about 9000 BCE (see above), but it is hypothesized by some archaeologists{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} that the elevated location may have functioned as a spiritual center during 10,000 BCE or earlier, essentially, at the very end of the [[Pleistocene]].\n\nThe surviving structures, then, not only predate [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and the invention of writing or the wheel, but were built before the [[Neolithic Revolution]], that marks the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], around 9000 BCE. The construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies, however. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local [[quarry|quarries]] and move them {{convert|100|-|500|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} to the site.<ref>{{cite web| title= Which came first, monumental building projects or farming? |work=Archaeo News |date= 14 December 2008 | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/003061.html}}</ref> The pillars weigh {{convert|10|-|20|MT|lk=out|0}}, with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taracha|first=Piotr|title=Religions of second millennium Anatolia|year=2009|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-3-447-05885-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTE7o8aKI7IC&pg=PA12&dq=%22G%C3%B6bekli+Tepe%22+%2250+tons%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=12}}</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE G\u00f6bekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" (Schmidt's phrase applied particularly to Layer III, Enclosure D) apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities. However, the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as {{convert|300|to|500|m3|cuyd|-1|sp=us}} of refuse, creating a tell consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools. Many animal, and even human, bones have been identified in the fill.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 242\u2014243, 249.</ref> Why the enclosures were buried is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Klaus Schmidt Monumento 2014 5.jpg|thumb|Klaus Schmidt, 2014 in Salzburg]]\nSchmidt's view was that G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a stone-age mountain sanctuary. [[Radiocarbon dating]] as well as comparative, stylistical analysis indicate that it is the oldest known temple yet discovered anywhere.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/><ref name=\"ArchMag\">{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov\u2013Dec 2008 | page=23}}</ref> Schmidt believed that what he called this \"cathedral on a hill\" was a pilgrimage destination attracting worshippers up to {{convert|150|km|abbr=on|-1}} distant. Butchered bones found in large numbers from local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, 207</ref>\n\nSchmidt considered G\u00f6bekli Tepe a central location for a [[Veneration of the dead|cult of the dead]] and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Though no tombs or graves have yet been found, Schmidt believed that graves remain to be discovered in niches located behind the walls of the sacred circles.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/>\n\nIn 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions was reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult.<ref>Julia Gresky, Juliane Haelm and Lee Clare, \"Modified human crania from G\u00f6bekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult\", ''Science Advances'', Vol. 3, no. 6, 28 Jun 2017. DOI:10.1126/sciadv.1700564 [http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/6/e1700564.full (full text)].</ref>\n\nSchmidt also interpreted the site in connection with the initial stages of the [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /> It is one of several sites in the vicinity of [[Karaca Da\u011f]], an area that [[genetics|geneticists]] suspect may have been the original source of at least some of our cultivated grains (see [[Einkorn]]). Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on [[Karaca Da\u011f]] {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated.<ref>Heun et al., ''Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting'', Science, 278 (1997) 1312\u201314.</ref>\n\nWith its mountains catching the rain and a calcareous, porous bedrock creating lots of springs, creeks, and rivers,<ref name=\":2\" /> the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris was a refuge during the dry and cold [[Younger Dryas]] climatic event (10,800 \u2013 9,500 BCE){{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. Speculation exists that conditions driven by population expansions locally could have led them to develop common rituals strengthened by monumental gathering places to reduce tensions and conflicts over resources,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/06/01/cooperative-action-of-hunter-gatherers-in-the-early-neolithic-near-east-a-view-from-goebekli-tepe/|title=Cooperative Action of Hunter-Gatherers in the Early Neolithic Near East. A View from G\u00f6bekli Tepe|last=Oliver|first=Dietrich|date=June 1, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and probably, to mark territorial claims.\n\nSchmidt also engaged in speculation regarding the belief systems of the groups that created G\u00f6bekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He presumed [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in [[Mesopotamia]], that was associated with extensive [[temple]]s and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient [[Sumer]]ian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain [[Ekur]], which was inhabited by [[Annuna]] deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 216\u2013221</ref> It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /><ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 193\u2013194; 218.</ref><ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, p. 209</ref> Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the G\u00f6bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.<ref>Dragos Gheorghiu (2015); ''A river runs through it. The semiotics of Gobekli Tepe's map (an exercise of archaeological imagination)'';  in Andrea Vianello (ed.), ''Rivers in Prehistory'', Oxford, Archaeopress</ref>\n\n==Importance==\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|Area of the [[fertile crescent]], circa 7500 BCE, with main sites.

[[Ian Hodder]] of Stanford University said, \"G\u00f6bekli Tepe changes everything\".<ref name=\":0\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/turkey-archeological-dig-reshaping-human-history-75101|title=Turkey: Archeological Dig Reshaping Human History|author=|date=18 February 2010|website=Newsweek}}</ref> If indeed the site was built by [[hunter-gatherer]]s as some researchers believe then it would mean that the ability to erect monumental complexes was within the capacities of these sorts of groups, which would overturn previous assumptions. Some researchers believe that the construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe may have contributed to the later development of urban civilization, or, as excavator Klaus Schmidt put it, \"First came the temple, then the city.\"<ref>K. Schmidt 2000: \"Zuerst kam der Tempel, dann die Stadt.\"</ref>\n[[File:T-shaped-pillars-PPN.jpg|thumb|Sites with T-shaped pillars from the PPN]]\nIn addition to its large dimensions, the side-by-side existence of multiple pillar shrines makes the location unique. There are no comparable monumental complexes from its time. Since its discovery, however, surface surveys have shown that several hills in the greater area also have T-shaped stone pillars (e.g. Hamzan Tepe,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/37.22/1714|title=Hamzan Tepe in the light of new finds|last=\u00c7elik|first=Bahattin|date=2010|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Karahan Tepe,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/38.19/1651|title=Karahan Tepe: a new cultural centre in the Urfa Area in Turkey|last=\u00c7elik|first=Bahattin|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Harbetsuvan Tepesi,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/43.21|title=A small-scale cult centre in Southeast Turkey: Harbetsuvan Tepesi|last=\u00c7elik|first=Bahattin|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Sefer Tepe,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/14/1790/18894.pdf|title=New pre-pottery neolithic settlements from Viran\u015fehir District|last=G\u00fcler, \u00c7elik, G\u00fcler|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and Tasl\u0131 Tepe<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/40.23/817|title=New Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites and cult centres in the Urfa Region|last=G\u00fcler, \u00c7elik, G\u00fcler|date=2013|website=|access-date=}}</ref>) but little excavation has been conducted.

It was excavated by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and has been submerged by the [[Atat\u00fcrk Dam]] since 1992. Its T-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its rectangular ceremonial structure was located inside a village. The roughly contemporary architecture at [[Jericho]] is devoid of artistic merit or large-scale sculpture, and [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]], perhaps the most famous Anatolian Neolithic village, is 2,000 years later.\n\nAt present G\u00f6bekli Tepe appears to raise more questions for archaeology and prehistory than it answers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} It remains unknown how a population large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and compensated or fed in the conditions of pre-sedentary society. Scholars have been unable to interpret the pictograms, and do not know what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there is little or no evidence of habitation, and many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to [[Apotropaic magic|stave off evils]] through some form of magic representation. Alternatively, they could have served as [[totem]]s.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004: pp. 209\u2013212</ref> The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"<ref>Banning 2011</ref> It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.<ref>Mann, June 2011, p. 48</ref> Human burials may have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was carefully backfilled remains unexplained. Based on current evidence, it is difficult to deduce anything certain about the originating culture or the site's significance.\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe site (2).JPG|thumb|G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]\nFuture plans include construction of a museum and converting the environs into an archaeological park, in the hope that this will help preserve the site in the state in which it was discovered.<ref>K.

The RRP has since been reestablished in 3rd [[Radio Battalion]], Kaneohe HI.

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter. [[Staff Sergeant]] Scott Laasanen and Sergeant Daniel Stinson served as team leaders during collection missions in support of [[Australian Defence Force|Australian forces]] intervening in [[civil war]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], as well as intelligence operations against rebel forces seeking to [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|overthrow]] the newly installed government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] in the Republic of the [[Philippines]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Radio Battalion]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Alfred M.

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter. [[Staff Sergeant]] Scott Laasanen and Sergeant Daniel Stinson served as team leaders during collection missions in support of [[Australian Defence Force|Australian forces]] intervening in [[civil war]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], as well as intelligence operations against rebel forces seeking to [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|overthrow]] the newly installed government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] in the Republic of the [[Philippines]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Radio Battalion]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Alfred M.

(See '[[minute]]' for another case where prime and double prime symbols are used to denote first and second cuts in refining measurement.)\n\n=== Pre-1959 ===\nIn the United States, the foot was defined as 12&nbsp;inches, with the inch being defined by the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893 by 39.37&nbsp;inches&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;m. In [[Imperial units]], the foot was defined as {{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter).\n\nThe yard standards of the different [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries were periodically compared with one another.<ref>See, for example, ''Report on the Comparisons of the Parliamentary Copies of the Imperial Standards with the Imperial Standard Yard and the Imperial Standard Pound and with each other during the Years 1947 to 1948'' (H.M.S.O., London, 1950).

The small difference between the survey and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the [[State Plane Coordinate System|state plane coordinate system]] (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted '''survey feet''' to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the [[retriangulation of Great Britain]] (1936\u201362) had been done in meters.\n\n====US survey foot{{anchor|United States survey foot}}====\nThe United States survey foot is defined as exactly {{frac|1200|3937}}&nbsp;meters, approximately {{val|0.304800609601|u=m}}.<ref>A.

This was not fully enforced, and in 1812 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] introduced the system of [[mesures usuelles]] which restored the traditional French measurements in the retail trade, but redefined them in terms of metric units. The foot, or ''pied m\u00e9trique'', was defined as one third of a meter.

Evidence that this unit was in widespread use across southern Britain is available from the [[Folkton Drums]] from  [[Yorkshire]] ([[neolithic]] artifacts, made from chalk, with circumferences that exactly divide as [[integers]] into ten long feet) and a similar object, the [[Lavant drum]], excavated at [[Lavant, West Sussex|Lavant]], Sussex, again with a circumference divisible as a whole number into ten long feet.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Teather |first1=Anne |display-authors=etal|title=Getting the Measure of Stonehenge |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=8 February 2019 |issue=165 |pages=48\u201351}}</ref>\n\nThe measures of [[Iron Age Britain]] are uncertain and proposed reconstructions such as the [[Megalithic Yard]] are controversial. Later [[Welsh legend]] credited [[Dyfnwal Moelmud]] with the establishment of [[Welsh units|their units]], including a foot of 9 inches. The Belgic or North German foot of 335&nbsp;mm (13.2&nbsp;inches) was introduced to England either by the [[Belgae|Belgic Celts]] during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the 5th and 6th century.\n\n[[Roman units]] were introduced following [[Roman conquest of England|their invasion]] in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;43. The [[Roman foot]] had been previously standardized by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] at around 296&nbsp;mm or 11.65&nbsp;inches. Following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman withdrawal]] and [[Saxon invasion of England|Saxon invasions]], the Roman foot continued to be used in the construction crafts while the Belgic foot was used for land measurement. Both the Welsh and Belgic feet seem to have been based on multiples of the [[barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]], but by as early as 950 the English kings seem to have (ineffectually) ordered measures to be based upon an iron yardstick at [[Winchester]] and then [[London]].

In some cases, the foot is denoted by a [[Prime (symbol)|prime]], which is often marked by an [[apostrophe]], and the inch by a double prime; for example, 2 feet 4&nbsp;inches is sometimes denoted as 2\u2032\u22124\u2033, 2\u2032 4\u2033 or 2\u20324\u2033.  (See '[[minute]]' for another case where prime and double prime symbols are used to denote first and second cuts in refining measurement.)\n\n=== Pre-1959 ===\nIn the United States, the foot was defined as 12&nbsp;inches, with the inch being defined by the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893 by 39.37&nbsp;inches&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;m. In [[Imperial units]], the foot was defined as {{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter).\n\nThe yard standards of the different [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries were periodically compared with one another.<ref>See, for example, ''Report on the Comparisons of the Parliamentary Copies of the Imperial Standards with the Imperial Standard Yard and the Imperial Standard Pound and with each other during the Years 1947 to 1948'' (H.M.S.O., London, 1950).

The small difference between the survey and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the [[State Plane Coordinate System|state plane coordinate system]] (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted '''survey feet''' to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the [[retriangulation of Great Britain]] (1936\u201362) had been done in meters.\n\n====US survey foot{{anchor|United States survey foot}}====\nThe United States survey foot is defined as exactly {{frac|1200|3937}}&nbsp;meters, approximately {{val|0.304800609601|u=m}}.<ref>A.

The virtual environment presented to the client is a merged view of the underlying physical and virtual resources, thereby allowing the virtualization layer to fool the application into thinking that it is running as if it were fully installed. ThinApp does not have any pre-installed components and does not require the installation of device drivers allowing applications to run from USB flash drives or network shares without ever requiring Administrator rights. ThinApp converts standard application installers such as .msi files into self-contained EXE files which includes everything required to run. Also it is able to scan a system before and after an application's installation and create a portable executable based upon changes made to the systems files and registry. Unlike self-extracting ZIP files, ThinApp does not extract files to disk or require system registry changes in order to run applications. ThinApp supports Windows XP and later, as well as Windows Server 2003 and later. ThinApp supports all released Windows systems from Windows NT4, 2000, XP (64/32), Vista (64/32),  Server 2003, Server 2008 (64), Server 2008 R2 (64), Windows 7 (64/32), Windows 8/8.1 (64/32, but not RT), and Windows 2012.<reF name=man51>{{cite book |url=https://www.vmware.com/pdf/thinapp51_manual.pdf |title=ThinApp User\u2019s Guide: ThinApp 5.1 |publisher=[[VMware]] |date=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Editions==\n{{update|section|date=December 2015}}\nThe most \"basic\" version of ThinApp is \"VMware ThinApp Starter Edition\", offered for free with any purchase of [[VMware Workstation]],<ref name=\"vmware.com\">http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/thinapp-starter-edition.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2010/11/buy-vmware-workstation-7-get-vmware-thinapp-starter-edition-for-free.html|title=Buy VMware Workstation 7, Get VMware ThinApp Starter Edition For Free!|work=vmware.com}}</ref> while the most \"advanced\" version is \"VMware ThinApp Enterprise Edition\", which adds support for ''AppSync updating'', ''Active Directory integration'' and allows usage by multiple users (both for the ''ThinApp Packager'' and ''ThinApp Client'').<ref name=\"vmware.com\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Microsoft App-V]]\n* [[Turbo (software)]]\n* [[Software appliance]]\n* [[Windows To Go]]\n* [[Sandboxie]]\n* [[Portable application creators]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.vmware.com/products/thinapp/}}\n\n[[Category:VMware|ThinApp]]\n[[Category:Virtualization software]]\n[[Category:Utilities for Windows]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Notability|Products|date=December 2015}}\n{{Advert|date=December 2015}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox software\n| name = VMware ThinApp\n| logo = VMware ThinApp v4.0 icon.png\n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| collapsible = \n| author = Jitit Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://communities.vmware.com/blogs/rameshgeddam/2010/09/22/vmware-thinapp-history-and-basic-working-nature|title=vFILTERS: VMware Thinapp history and basic work... - VMware Communities|work=vmware.com}}</ref>\n| developer = [[VMware]]\n| released = \n| latest release version = 5.2.6\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2019|09|12}}<ref>{{Cite web\n  |url = https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-ThinApp/5.2.6/rn/VMware-ThinApp-526-Release-Notes.html\n  |title = VMware ThinApp 5.2.6 Release Notes\n  |work = VMware ThinApp 5.2.6 Release Notes\n  |publisher = VMware, Inc\n  |date = September 12, 2019\n  |accessdate = September 12, 2019\n }}</ref>\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = \n| programming language = \n| operating system = [[Windows Vista]] and later<br/>[[Windows Server 2008]] and later (Windows XP and 2k3 supported  by 5.2.3 and old version)\n| platform = \n| size = 85.5&nbsp;[[Megabytes|MB]]\n| language = \n| genre = [[Application virtualization]]<br />[[Portable application creator]]\n| license = [[Shareware]]\n| website = {{URL|http://www.vmware.com/products/thinapp}}\n}}\n\n'''VMware ThinApp''' (formerly ''Thinstall'') is an [[application virtualization]] and [[portable application creator]] suite by [[VMware]] that can package conventional applications<ref name=man51 /> so that they become [[portable application]]s.

The virtual environment presented to the client is a merged view of the underlying physical and virtual resources, thereby allowing the virtualization layer to fool the application into thinking that it is running as if it were fully installed. ThinApp does not have any pre-installed components and does not require the installation of device drivers allowing applications to run from USB flash drives or network shares without ever requiring Administrator rights. ThinApp converts standard application installers such as .msi files into self-contained EXE files which includes everything required to run.
