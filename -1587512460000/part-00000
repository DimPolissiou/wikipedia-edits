Completed in 1916, she was assigned to the [[Dover Patrol]] where her primary duties involved bombarding German targets on the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgian coast]], particularly at the ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]]. In October 1917 ''Terror'' was hit by three torpedoes, taking severe damage to the bow and had to be towed into [[Portsmouth]] for repair. In April 1918 she participated in the [[Zeebrugge raid]] and provided gunnery support for the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] in September of the same year.\n\nAfter the war the monitor was attached to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school in Portsmouth and participated in gunnery trials in the 1920s. In January 1934 ''Terror'' became the base ship at [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] where she remained for the rest of the decade. From May 1939 to the end of the year she underwent an extensive refit in Singapore's dockyards.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War and the completion of her refit, ''Terror'' was ordered home to Europe in January 1940. From early March the monitor served in the Mediterranean where she defended [[Siege of Malta (1940)|Malta]] from Italian air raids before supporting the land-based assault of Italian positions in North Africa at the end of the year. In January 1941 the ship assisted with the capture of [[Bardia]] and [[Tobruk]] before she attempted to defend [[Benghazi]] from German air attacks in February. Suffering damage from two air attacks and two mines on 22 and 23 February, ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] in the early hours of 24 February. The crew were evacuated to the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Fareham|J89|2}} and [[corvette]] {{HMS|Salvia|K97|2}} prior to her sinking.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of [[Naval Gunfire Support|naval bombardment]].<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 1; Buxton 2008 c. 1</ref> Termed [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow [[Draft (hull)|draught]] and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The {{sclass-|Marshal Ney|monitor|4}} was the United Kingdom's first attempt at a monitor carrying {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 24</ref> Following construction of the first two of the ''Marshall Ney-class'', another four were ordered in May 1915, with the [[Harland and Wolff]] [[shipyard]] at [[Govan]] receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given [[yard number]]s 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the [[battleship]], {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}}, and the monitors before 1917.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.1</ref>\n\nBy August 1915, {{HMS|Marshal Ney||2}}, the first of its class, had revealed a very poor performance in its sea trials. Its engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling,<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 25</ref> making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 4.2, para. 3</ref> Disappointed by the failure, the [[Admiralty]] began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge's width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\">Brown 1999 p. 148</ref><ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe new design, which would later be named the ''Erebus''-class, was for a vessel {{convert|405|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} long, {{convert|88|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|1}} [[Beam (nautical)|wide]] with a draught of {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on|1}}. It would have {{convert|8,450|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Displacement (ship)#Loaded displacement|loaded displacement]],<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.3para2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.3 para. 2</ref>{{efn-lr|Official figures for displacement on completion were not recorded for either vessel of the ''Erebus''-class, leading to historians estimating the true displacement from the completed design and manifest.

Poor weather conditions continued for the rest of 1916 and the patrol made no further attempts that year to bombard the Belgian coast.

Reasons for postponement included snapped towlines and poor weather conditions. However, the operation eventually commenced on the evening of 11 May with ''Terror'' acting as flagship for Vice-Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]]. The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors {{HMS|Marshal Soult||2}} and ''Terror'' concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship ''Erebus'' concentrating on the north gate. Poor visibility and problems with [[Air Observation Post|spotting aircraft]] meant that the fall of shot couldn't be fully observed or their trajectories corrected. The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British [[smoke screen]]. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore.

The crew evacuated while a tug boat maintained a line to the ship. They were able to reboard ''Terror'' the next day and brought her back into Dover harbour. During the second attempt to reach Portsmouth on 27 October, Bruton again refused to sail the ship backwards but changed his mind after the salvage expert left the ship. She was then towed backwards to Portsmouth, where it took until early January to repair the damage.<ref>Dunn, Chapter 13, Section: \"New monitors\"</ref>  A [[Court-martial|Court of Inquiry]] was called into the 23 October abandonment.

The Germans immediately began an intense series of air raids against both Benghazi and Tobruk, which included the dropping of [[magnetic mines]] into the harbours.<ref>Raugh 2013 p. 123; Playfair 1956 p. 12</ref> \n\n[[File:Pictures For Illustrating Ritchie Ii Book.

As part of this work, a team from ''Peony'' safely detonated a mine close to ''Terror's'' mooring.<ref>Parker 2013 p. 215</ref> Despite the monitor's efforts to protect the harbour using her anti-aircraft guns, the convoy was unable to offload the majority of its cargo due to the frequent air attacks and sailed on to Tobruk on 20 February. ''Terror'' remained in port together with the minesweeper ''Fareham'' and corvette ''Salvia'' to protect the naval parties clearing the harbour.<ref>Bechthold 2017 pp. 128\u2013129; Playfair 1956 p. 12; Brown 2013 p. 64</ref> \n\n''Terror'' was subjected to continued bombing attacks while in harbour and a near miss early on 22 February caused significant damage and flooding of the decks. Haynes protested the lack of air support to Cunningham along with the dangers of remaining at anchor, stating that it was only a matter of time before ''Terror'' received a direct hit. Accepting this assessment, Cunningham ordered the ship to sail for Tobruk on the evening tide with ''Fareham'' and ''Salvia''.<ref>Brown 2013 p. 64</ref> As they were exiting the harbour the monitor triggered two magnetic mines in the previously cleared channel; although again not a direct hit, the explosions in close proximity caused further damage and flooding.<ref>Bechthold 2017 p. 129</ref> On the evening of 23 February she was attacked once more by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers from III/[[StG 2]] under the command of [[Helmut Mahlke]]. The ''gruppe'', which had been initially set up as an anti-shipping unit by the [[Kriegsmarine]], had been drafted in to attack shipping in the vicinity.<ref>Smith 2011, pp. 267\u2013268</ref> The attack occurred while the ship was {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Tobruk; the near misses of this final assault leaving the ship critically damaged. Further floodwater disabled the electric generators and pumps and extinguished the boiler furnaces. The majority of the crew were evacuated to ''Fareham'' and ''Salvia'' with a skeleton crew of officers and anti-aircraft gunners remaining on board to operate the ship. ''Terror'' was taken under tow by ''Fareham'' in an attempt to reach Tobruk and additional ships were scrambled from Alexandria and Tobruk. However, the monitor continued to take on water and it was accepted that she would never reach port. ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] through the opening of the [[seacock]]s and the use of [[depth charges]] on the morning of 24 February, {{convert|25|miles|km}} to the north west of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]].

Completed in 1916, she was assigned to the [[Dover Patrol]] where her primary duties involved bombarding German targets on the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgian coast]], particularly at the ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]]. In October 1917 ''Terror'' was hit by three torpedoes, taking severe damage to the bow and had to be towed into [[Portsmouth]] for repair. In April 1918 she participated in the [[Zeebrugge raid]] and provided gunnery support for the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] in September of the same year.\n\nAfter the war the monitor was attached to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school in Portsmouth and participated in gunnery trials in the 1920s. In January 1934 ''Terror'' became the base ship at [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] where she remained for the rest of the decade. From May 1939 to the end of the year she underwent an extensive refit in Singapore's dockyards.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War and the completion of her refit, ''Terror'' was ordered home to Europe in January 1940. From early March the monitor served in the Mediterranean where she defended [[Siege of Malta (1940)|Malta]] from Italian air raids before supporting the land-based assault of Italian positions in North Africa at the end of the year. In January 1941 the ship assisted with the capture of [[Bardia]] and [[Tobruk]] before she attempted to defend [[Benghazi]] from German air attacks in February. Suffering damage from two air attacks and two mines on 22 and 23 February, ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] in the early hours of 24 February. The crew were evacuated to the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Fareham|J89|2}} and [[corvette]] {{HMS|Salvia|K97|2}} prior to her sinking.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of [[Naval Gunfire Support|naval bombardment]].<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 1; Buxton 2008 c. 1</ref> Termed [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow [[Draft (hull)|draught]] and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The {{sclass-|Marshal Ney|monitor|4}} was the United Kingdom's first attempt at a monitor carrying {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 24</ref> Following construction of the first two of the ''Marshall Ney-class'', another four were ordered in May 1915, with the [[Harland and Wolff]] [[shipyard]] at [[Govan]] receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given [[yard number]]s 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the [[battleship]], {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}}, and the monitors before 1917.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.1</ref>\n\nBy August 1915, {{HMS|Marshal Ney||2}}, the first of its class, had revealed a very poor performance in its sea trials. Its engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling,<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 25</ref> making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 4.2, para. 3</ref> Disappointed by the failure, the [[Admiralty]] began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge's width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\">Brown 1999 p. 148</ref><ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe new design, which would later be named the ''Erebus''-class, was for a vessel {{convert|405|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} long, {{convert|88|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|1}} [[Beam (nautical)|wide]] with a draught of {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on|1}}.

However, the new monitor only fired a small number of shots, as it was felt wiser to conserve her guns for more important targets. On 24 September the ship made an attempt to bombard the port of [[Zeebrugge]] but this was soon aborted when the weather conditions prevented the accurate observation of [[Indirect fire|fall of shot]] and any subsequent correction of trajectory. Poor weather conditions continued for the rest of 1916 and the patrol made no further attempts that year to bombard the Belgian coast. During the winter of 1916 and 1917, ''Terror'' acted as a guard boat for ships anchored at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], following a spate of attacks by German destroyers.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\">Buxton 2008 Chapter 8.4</ref>\n\nIn early 1917, ''Terror'' and the rest of the patrol made several aborted attempts to bombard the [[lock gate]]s of the Bruges Canal at Zeebrugge but the operation had to be postponed each time. Reasons for postponement included snapped towlines and poor weather conditions. However, the operation eventually commenced on the evening of 11 May with ''Terror'' acting as flagship for Vice-Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]]. The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors {{HMS|Marshal Soult||2}} and ''Terror'' concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship ''Erebus'' concentrating on the north gate. Poor visibility and problems with [[Air Observation Post|spotting aircraft]] meant that the fall of shot couldn't be fully observed or their trajectories corrected. The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British [[smoke screen]]. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore. The flotilla withdrew to Dover, in the mistaken belief that their bombardment had been successful. Subsequent aerial reconnaissance revealed damage to the surrounding area but the lock gates, the primary targets, were untouched.<ref>Buxton 2008 Chapter 4.3</ref><ref>Dunn, Chapter 14, Section: \"The bombardment of Zeebrugge, 12 May 1917\"</ref>\n\nA bombardment of [[Ostend]] on 5 June by ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' was more successful, destroying or damaging several vessels and damaging the dockyard.<ref>Dunn 2017 chapter 17, section \"The bombardment of Ostend, 5 June 1957\"</ref>{{efn-lr|Crossley (2013) makes the claim that [[SM UC-70|U-boat UC.70]] was destroyed in the 5 June attack.

Captain Bruton was advised by a salvage expert to sail the ship stern-first to Portsmouth to reduce pressure on the bow but chose to disregard the advice. The ship sailed first to Dover on 21 October but on the next leg of the journey to Portsmouth two days later, in heavy seas, a major leak developed off [[Hastings]]. The crew evacuated while a tug boat maintained a line to the ship. They were able to reboard ''Terror'' the next day and brought her back into Dover harbour. During the second attempt to reach Portsmouth on 27 October, Bruton again refused to sail the ship backwards but changed his mind after the salvage expert left the ship. She was then towed backwards to Portsmouth, where it took until early January to repair the damage.<ref>Dunn, Chapter 13, Section: \"New monitors\"</ref>  A [[Court-martial|Court of Inquiry]] was called into the 23 October abandonment. Bacon supported Bruton's decision to leave the vessel and the salvage expert was not called to give evidence.
