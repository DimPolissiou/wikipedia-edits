In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

our immune response to pathogens in all organs, in particular at mucosal surfaces. <ref name=\"Colonna2018\"/> They are key in the innate immune response due to their ability to rapidly secrete immunoregulatory cytokines, however, they also play a role in the shaping of the adaptive response by interacting with other immune cells. The microenvironment of the tissue they reside in determines and fine- tunes the expression of the diverse ILC profiles, facilitating their interaction in multiple effector functions. \n\nThe strategic positioning and deep rooting of ILCs within tissues allow them to maintain homeostasis, and therefore healthy tissue functioning. However, the ILCs also have detrimental roles in different mucosal sites.<ref name=\"KotasLocksley2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Kotas|first1=Maya E.|last2=Locksley|first2=Richard M.|title=Why Innate Lymphoid Cells?|journal=Immunity|volume=48|issue=6|year=2018|pages=1081\u20131090|issn=10747613|doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2018.06.002}}</ref>\n\nSince the function of ILCs is linked to their specific tissue localization, determination of the signals involved in their localization and migration patterns will be important in the identification of new avenues for treatment of diseases. <ref name=\"PantaziPowell2019\"/> \n\n=== Helminth infection and tissue repair ===\n\nA fundamental property of type 2 immunity, and therefore ILC2 cells, is to deal with oversized organisms, that cannot be digested, such as the [[Parasitic worm|helminths]].<ref name=\"L\u00f6serSmith2019\">{{cite journal|last1=L\u00f6ser|first1=Stephan|last2=Smith|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Maizels|first3=Rick M.|title=Innate Lymphoid Cells in Helminth Infections\u2014Obligatory or Accessory?|journal=Frontiers in Immunology|volume=10|year=2019|issn=1664-3224|doi=10.3389/fimmu.2019.00620}}</ref> In the intestine, in response to a helminth infection, epithelial cells secrete high levels of IL-25, activating ILC2 cells.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means transportation of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, are therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Upon dysregulation of homeostasis in the adipose tissue, the decreased responses of ILC2s are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure, and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s. [[Basophil]]s and mast cells are also present in these skin lesions, producing IL-4, and [[Prostaglandin D2|PGD2]], further activating ILC2s. \n\n[[File:ILCs in psoriasis 10 PNG.png|thumb|300px|alt= A diagram of the skin epidermis, and the ILC3s, and other effector cells (T cells, neutrophils) present in the environment, and their effector cytokines involved in causing psoriasis.|The ILCs present in the epidermis of patients with psoriasis, and the effector cytokines and cells involved in causing inflammation/ epidermal thickening.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>]]\n\n[[File:ILCs in atopic dermatitis 9 PNG FINAL.png|thumb|250px|center|alt= A diagram of the skin epidermis, and the ILC2s, and other effector cells (basophils, and mast cells) present in the environment, and their effector cytokines involved in causing atopic dermatitis.|The ILCs present in the epidermis of patients with atopic dermatitis, and the effector cells and cytokines involved in causing the pathophysiology of the disease.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>]]\n\n[[Psoriasis]], another inflammatory skin disease, causes epidermal thickening, forming plaques which are mainly populated with T cells and dendritic cells. The T cells portray a type 1 immune response; however, the thickening and inflammation of the epidermis is thought to be caused by the production of IL-22, IL-17A, and IL-17F by other T cells such as Th17 or [[Gamma delta T cell|\u03b3\u03b4 T cells]].<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> However, more recent data suggests that ILC3s infact produce a large number of these cytokines, with an increase in the number of ILC3s in the peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>\n\n== Plasticity == \n\nOur classification of ILCs into subsets provides a simplified framework, however, despite the above [[#classification|classification]] system, several studies suggest their development and phenotypic maintenance is much more complex, with a high level of plasticity between the subsets.
