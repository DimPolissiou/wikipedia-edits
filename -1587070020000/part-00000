In 2026, a civil war erupts on Altis following a [[coup d'etat]] by the Altis Armed Forces (AAF). In 2030, a ceasefire is declared. A loyalist rebel group, the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), rejects the new military government and wages a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the AAF. NATO [[peacekeeping]] forces are deployed to Altis, establishing a US-led joint NATO-AAF peacekeeping force, Task Force Aegis (TF Aegis). Five years later, NATO investment in the Aegean dwindles, and CSAT begins to subsidize the AAF and mobilizes its own forces in the Pacific. With the peacekeeping mandate nearing its end, NATO begins to withdraw from Altis, and tensions rise between AAF and NATO.<ref>https://arma3.com/features/campaign</ref><ref>https://arma3.com/features/factions</ref>\n\nThe DLC campaign, ''Apex Protocol'', added in the ''ARMA 3: Apex'' expansion, is set on the Northern Division of a South Pacific island group nation known as the Horizon Islands Federation. The division is commonly known as Tanoa, the largest island in the division. The campaign takes place after the events of the base game campaign, following the regroup with NATO ending.\n\n''Remnants of War'' is a story-driven DLC campaign added in the ''Laws of War'' DLC. The story focuses on Nathan MacDade, an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] technician working for the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP for short), a humanitarian [[NGO]]. Other scenarios are explored as Nathan reminisces about past events. Some actions the player can take have moral consequences, which are reflected in the ending.\n\nThe main player character of the singleplayer campaign features [[Corporal]] Ben Kerry, a [[United States Army|US Army]] soldier assigned to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] deployed on Stratis. Players also play as [[Sergeant]] Conway during the prologue. Other major NATO characters include [[Staff Sergeant]] Adams, General Armstrong, as well as Combat Technology Research Group (a NATO spec ops group, CTRG for short) personnel Captain Scott Miller, and Miller's second in command Lieutenant James. Major FIA characters include Kostas Stavrou, leader of northern FIA forces, and Nikos Panagopoulos, an FIA head. Players play as CTRG Group 15 operators in ''Apex Protocol''.\n\n===''The East Wind''===\nIn 2034, a firing incident between the AAF and FIA leads to the breakdown of their ceasefire, and eventually escalates into open warfare. NATO-AAF relations deteriorate, and NATO peacekeepers are reduced to the smaller island of Stratis. By 2035, NATO prepares to fully withdraw from Stratis. On July 7, 2035, the AAF suddenly attacks the remaining NATO forces on Stratis, destroying their bases and killing their commander.{{#tag:ref|The exact cause of AAF attacking NATO is unclear, though it is implied to be a reaction to a NATO black operation.|group=N}} Corporal Ben Kerry and Staff Sergeant Adams attempt to regroup with NATO survivors, but Adams is killed by a [[landmine]]. Kerry and other NATO survivors eventually regroup under a group of [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British special forces]] led by Captain Scott Miller.\n\nMiller organizes a number of ineffective [[guerrilla]] missions against the AAF, while his own squad conducts clandestine operations independently. Over the course of a few days, under group Alpha, Kerry helps destroy a helicopter to hide the position of the NATO survivors, breaks an AAF siege around a small village, assassinates a high ranking AAF commander, and helps attack Mike Air Station-26 to try and contact NATO MEDCOM (which fails). After making contact with an FIA operative by the name of Nikos Panagopolous, Kerry's group follows them to a cache, only to have it destroyed by AAF forces, with Nikos seemingly escaping. With the cache lost, Miller orders an attack on AAF positions in the south, but after overunning a village, mortar fire hits Camp Maxwell where the NATO survivors are hiding. Despite Miller's orders, Kerry's team returns to camp to find it in ruins, with NATO survivors tending to the wounded. The next day, Miller manages to contact NATO command and arranges for a re-invasion of Stratis. To assist with the invasion, Miller leads the survivors to take control of a town on Stratis, called Agia Marina. However, CSAT reinforcements foil the operation, and Miller orders the survivors to head to Altis on two boats he prepared in a small cove. Miller states that the survivors will link up with the FIA upon arriving at Altis, but AAF [[Attack aircraft|attack jets]] attack and destroy the boats before they arrive at Altis.\n\nKerry wakes up on Altis and manages to reunite with Lieutenant James, Miller's second in command, who laid in on a mountain after an FIA attack on Kavala (the former capital of Altis) failed miserably. Kerry is taken to the FIA and given charge of an FIA squad to ambush a convoy. During this part, Kerry can accidentally destroy the ammo truck, though it does not effect the outcome of the mission as CSAT carries out a massive counterattack and nearly exterminates the FIA, forcing them to move to a different camp near Gori. More missions pass as Kerry helps take down an outpost and capture a fuel truck (he can either use the fuel truck to blow up a ranking commander from CSAT and lower CSAT's reserves in later missions, or bring the fuel back and get a head start on other missions). In the next mission, Kerry helps an officer named Orestes defect, and uses him to either take down a helicopter or raid a CSAT fuel dump. Eventually, the FIA learns that their main smuggler and figurehead, Nikos Panagopolous, has been spotted on the island of Stratis, and CTRG arranges a rescue operation to retrieve him. The operation is successful, and the FIA begins to become more emboldened in their strategy. Later on, the FIA learns that NATO main forces will be invading Altis, and plans their own operation to assist. During the operation, Kerry witnesses NATO [[gunship]]s firing on FIA forces. Kerry manages to call off the attack through a downed NATO pilot. The next day, NATO commander Colonel Armstrong meets with Kerry and tells him that they were unaware of the FIA's activities around the AAC airfield. When Kerry asks about Miller, Armstrong responds that he has no knowledge of Scott Miller, and that British forces left Stratis many months ago. Mentioning Miller drives Armstrong to believe Kerry may be hostile, on top of the fact that he is the only survivor from Task Force Aegis on Stratis.\n\nArmstrong, under the callsign \"Crossroads\", orders Kerry to lead an FIA squad and assist in NATO operations. NATO manages to repel AAF and CSAT forces and secure most of Altis. Crossroads confirms that Miller is not hostile, but he warns Kerry to avoid him and his team. During this time, tectonic activity on Altis increases sharply.\n\nWith the AAF on the verge of defeat, Crossroads orders all NATO forces to regroup for one final offensive, Kerry is suddenly contacted by a dying Lt. James who provides his location to find him. Kerry can either regroup with NATO or disobey orders and find James.\n\nIf Kerry regroups with NATO, Kerry is ordered to lead a reconnaissance squad to mark out enemy positions and spearhead the offensive. The AAF surrenders shortly after the offensive begins. An epilogue set six weeks later shows peace returning to Altis, while Kerry, now Sergeant, works with the continued NATO presence to maintain peace.\n\nIf Kerry looks for James, Kerry finds him at the site of a failed assault on a secret CSAT facility. James orders Kerry to find a truck loaded with a special device and take it to Miller, before dying. Kerry finds the truck in the facility and brings it to Miller. Kerry confronts Miller about his manipulations and the nature of the device, but Miller only hints that the device is responsible for the recent tremors. As they talk, CSAT suddenly launches a massive invasion against both NATO and the AAF, forcing NATO into withdrawal. Miller initially promises to return for Kerry after he takes the device off the island, but breaks the promise after he leaves, leaving Kerry alone to find a way off the island.\n\n===''Apex Protocol''===\n\nFollowing a major tsunami known as the Pacific disaster, the paramilitary crime syndicate, the Syndikat, rose to power in several regions on Tanoa. Finding the Syndikat's rapid expansion suspicious, NATO sends in CTRG Group 15 to investigate.\n\nCTRG Group 15, under callsign \"Raider\", deploys on Tanoa and conducts several operations against the Syndikat, destroying a Syndikat ammo depot and ambushing a Syndikat convoy. They discover evidence of CSAT support of the Syndikat. During an operation to capture the Syndikat's leader, Solomon Maru, Raider instead finds that they've been led into an ambush by the Chinese CSAT special forces Viper Team. Raider manages to escape from the ambush.\n\nFollowing the ambush, Raider conducts an operation to rescue CTRG asset \"Keystone\". Keystone turns out to be Captain Scott Miller, leader of CTRG Group 14, who had been tracking the special CSAT device since it left Altis, which is a [[tectonic weapon]] codenamed \"Eastwind\". Miller believes that Viper deployed Eastwind on Tanoa, causing the Pacific disaster, and supported the Syndikat, all to destabilize Tanoa.\n\nAfter rescuing Miller, CTRG raids a Viper black site on Tanoa to retrieve Eastwind. They find the black site already attacked and abandoned; Syndikat double-crossed CSAT before CTRG arrived, holding Eastwind ransom to blackmail against CSAT. CTRG did however recover files about CSAT's \"Apex Protocol,\" which involves using operatives to destabilize strategically important nations so CSAT can provide assistance and foster CSAT support.\n\nCTRG tracks Eastwind to a large port, where CSAT attempts to deal with Syndikat to recover Eastwind, while Maru arms Eastwind. CTRG quickly attacks, fighting against both Syndikat and Viper, and manages to kill Maru, disarm Eastwind, and secure the device. Following the operation, CSAT's Apex Protocol is exposed to the whole world, leading to international condemnation, while Eastwind is now in NATO's possession.\n\n===''Remnants of War''===\n\nDays after the end of the NATO invasion of Altis, a civilian mechanic from the Altis town of Oreokastro returns to the town, after hearing news that his missing brother had appeared at the town's church in a recent firefight. As he searches the church, he is killed by a landmine.\n\nSeveral days later, journalist Katherine Bishop conducts an online interview with Nathan MacDade as he works on the disposal of [[explosive remnants of war]] at Oreokastro. Oreokastro, formerly a major FIA garrison and the site of an IDAP camp, was completely destroyed during the war and is now a [[ghost town]]. Nathan reminisces about Oreokastro's past as he conducts his work, and tells five stories surrounding Oreokastro during the war.\n\n* In the first story, after the breakdown of the FIA-AAF ceasefire, NATO peacekeeper Staff Sergeant Adams led a TF Aegis squad to secure a NATO [[airdrop]] intended for the Oreokastro IDAP camp, and repelled an attack from FIA bandits.\n* In the second story, a FIA fighter from Oreokastro, Alexis Kouris, sets up defenses around Oreokastro after the AAF announced their plans to assault the town.\n* In the third story, Nathan recounts a rumor that a squad of supposed CSAT special forces parachuted in near Oreokastro and [[Laser designator|designated]] FIA positions in the town for an AAF [[cluster bomb]] air strike, destroying much of the town. Nathan notes that NATO casings were discovered on site, and it is implied that the special forces may have been Miller's CTRG team instead.\n* In the fourth story, Markos Kouris, Alexis' brother and a [[non-combatant]] at Oreokastro, was heavily injured by the AAF air strike. As the AAF assaults the town, Markos limps his way to the IDAP camp at the town church, and was eventually evacuated. The town is abandoned after the assault.\n* In the final story, set during the NATO invasion of Altis, AAF officers Lieutenant Antoniou Dimitriou and Major Gavras were overwhelmed by NATO-FIA forces and were pushed back to Oreokastro. The two defend themselves at the town's church, and deploy landmines for self defense. They withstand the attack and extract. Alexis is one of the casualties in the assault, leading Markos to search the church after the war, resulting in him being killed by leftover landmines.\n\nBack at present, Katherine asks Nathan about who he thinks is most responsible for the destruction of Oreokastro: NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA, or nobody. After Nathan responds, Katherine shows Nathan a draft of her report on the impacts the war had left on the life on Altis, the contents reflecting on the player's actions throughout the campaign. As Nathan completes the EOD operation, he bides Katherine farewell as he and his team pack up and leave Oreokastro, proceeding to their next cleanup site.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:James Crowe Bohemia Interactive.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jay Crowe was the game's creative director and provided some voice acting for the game.]]\nBohemia Interactive officially announced the development of ''ARMA 3'' on May 19, 2011.<ref name=\"arma3anounced\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/bohemia-interactive-oznamuje-arma-3-55791|title=ARMA 3 announced|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012 an [[Alpha release|alpha version]] of the game was demonstrated at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].<ref name=\"alpha-e3\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tv/arma-3-e3-2012-rozhovor-6419|title=Arma 3 shown during E3 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Bohemia Interactive announced that they will release three [[downloadable content]] episodes for free after the game's initial launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arma3.com/news/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-3-free-dlc-episodes|title=Free DLC|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> An alpha version of the game was released on March 5, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience.

NATO [[peacekeeping]] forces are deployed to Altis, establishing a US-led joint NATO-AAF peacekeeping force, Task Force Aegis (TF Aegis). Five years later, NATO investment in the Aegean dwindles, and CSAT begins to subsidize the AAF and mobilizes its own forces in the Pacific. With the peacekeeping mandate nearing its end, NATO begins to withdraw from Altis, and tensions rise between AAF and NATO.<ref>https://arma3.com/features/campaign</ref><ref>https://arma3.com/features/factions</ref>\n\nThe DLC campaign, ''Apex Protocol'', added in the ''ARMA 3: Apex'' expansion, is set on the Northern Division of a South Pacific island group nation known as the Horizon Islands Federation. The division is commonly known as Tanoa, the largest island in the division. The campaign takes place after the events of the base game campaign, following the regroup with NATO ending.\n\n''Remnants of War'' is a story-driven DLC campaign added in the ''Laws of War'' DLC. The story focuses on Nathan MacDade, an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] technician working for the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP for short), a humanitarian [[NGO]]. Other scenarios are explored as Nathan reminisces about past events. Some actions the player can take have moral consequences, which are reflected in the ending.\n\nThe main player character of the singleplayer campaign features [[Corporal]] Ben Kerry, a [[United States Army|US Army]] soldier assigned to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] deployed on Stratis. Players also play as [[Sergeant]] Conway during the prologue. Other major NATO characters include [[Staff Sergeant]] Adams, General Armstrong, as well as Combat Technology Research Group (a NATO spec ops group, CTRG for short) personnel Captain Scott Miller, and Miller's second in command Lieutenant James. Major FIA characters include Kostas Stavrou, leader of northern FIA forces, and Nikos Panagopoulos, an FIA head. Players play as CTRG Group 15 operators in ''Apex Protocol''.\n\n===''The East Wind''===\nIn 2034, a firing incident between the AAF and FIA leads to the breakdown of their ceasefire, and eventually escalates into open warfare. NATO-AAF relations deteriorate, and NATO peacekeepers are reduced to the smaller island of Stratis. By 2035, NATO prepares to fully withdraw from Stratis. On July 7, 2035, the AAF suddenly attacks the remaining NATO forces on Stratis, destroying their bases and killing their commander.{{#tag:ref|The exact cause of AAF attacking NATO is unclear, though it is implied to be a reaction to a NATO black operation.|group=N}} Corporal Ben Kerry and Staff Sergeant Adams attempt to regroup with NATO survivors, but Adams is killed by a [[landmine]]. Kerry and other NATO survivors eventually regroup under a group of [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British special forces]] led by Captain Scott Miller.\n\nMiller organizes a number of ineffective [[guerrilla]] missions against the AAF, while his own squad conducts clandestine operations independently. Over the course of a few days, under group Alpha, Kerry helps destroy a helicopter to hide the position of the NATO survivors, breaks an AAF siege around a small village, assassinates a high ranking AAF commander, and helps attack Mike Air Station-26 to try and contact NATO MEDCOM (which fails). After making contact with an FIA operative by the name of Nikos Panagopolous, Kerry's group follows them to a cache, only to have it destroyed by AAF forces, with Nikos seemingly escaping. With the cache lost, Miller orders an attack on AAF positions in the south, but after overunning a village, mortar fire hits Camp Maxwell where the NATO survivors are hiding. Despite Miller's orders, Kerry's team returns to camp to find it in ruins, with NATO survivors tending to the wounded. The next day, Miller manages to contact NATO command and arranges for a re-invasion of Stratis. To assist with the invasion, Miller leads the survivors to take control of a town on Stratis, called Agia Marina. However, CSAT reinforcements foil the operation, and Miller orders the survivors to head to Altis on two boats he prepared in a small cove. Miller states that the survivors will link up with the FIA upon arriving at Altis, but AAF [[Attack aircraft|attack jets]] attack and destroy the boats before they arrive at Altis.\n\nKerry wakes up on Altis and manages to reunite with Lieutenant James, Miller's second in command, who laid in on a mountain after an FIA attack on Kavala (the former capital of Altis) failed miserably. Kerry is taken to the FIA and given charge of an FIA squad to ambush a convoy. During this part, Kerry can accidentally destroy the ammo truck, though it does not effect the outcome of the mission as CSAT carries out a massive counterattack and nearly exterminates the FIA, forcing them to move to a different camp near Gori. More missions pass as Kerry helps take down an outpost and capture a fuel truck (he can either use the fuel truck to blow up a ranking commander from CSAT and lower CSAT's reserves in later missions, or bring the fuel back and get a head start on other missions). In the next mission, Kerry helps an officer named Orestes defect, and uses him to either take down a helicopter or raid a CSAT fuel dump. Eventually, the FIA learns that their main smuggler and figurehead, Nikos Panagopolous, has been spotted on the island of Stratis, and CTRG arranges a rescue operation to retrieve him. The operation is successful, and the FIA begins to become more emboldened in their strategy. Later on, the FIA learns that NATO main forces will be invading Altis, and plans their own operation to assist. During the operation, Kerry witnesses NATO [[gunship]]s firing on FIA forces. Kerry manages to call off the attack through a downed NATO pilot. The next day, NATO commander Colonel Armstrong meets with Kerry and tells him that they were unaware of the FIA's activities around the AAC airfield. When Kerry asks about Miller, Armstrong responds that he has no knowledge of Scott Miller, and that British forces left Stratis many months ago. Mentioning Miller drives Armstrong to believe Kerry may be hostile, on top of the fact that he is the only survivor from Task Force Aegis on Stratis.\n\nArmstrong, under the callsign \"Crossroads\", orders Kerry to lead an FIA squad and assist in NATO operations. NATO manages to repel AAF and CSAT forces and secure most of Altis. Crossroads confirms that Miller is not hostile, but he warns Kerry to avoid him and his team. During this time, tectonic activity on Altis increases sharply.\n\nWith the AAF on the verge of defeat, Crossroads orders all NATO forces to regroup for one final offensive, Kerry is suddenly contacted by a dying Lt. James who provides his location to find him. Kerry can either regroup with NATO or disobey orders and find James.\n\nIf Kerry regroups with NATO, Kerry is ordered to lead a reconnaissance squad to mark out enemy positions and spearhead the offensive. The AAF surrenders shortly after the offensive begins. An epilogue set six weeks later shows peace returning to Altis, while Kerry, now Sergeant, works with the continued NATO presence to maintain peace.\n\nIf Kerry looks for James, Kerry finds him at the site of a failed assault on a secret CSAT facility. James orders Kerry to find a truck loaded with a special device and take it to Miller, before dying. Kerry finds the truck in the facility and brings it to Miller. Kerry confronts Miller about his manipulations and the nature of the device, but Miller only hints that the device is responsible for the recent tremors. As they talk, CSAT suddenly launches a massive invasion against both NATO and the AAF, forcing NATO into withdrawal. Miller initially promises to return for Kerry after he takes the device off the island, but breaks the promise after he leaves, leaving Kerry alone to find a way off the island.\n\n===''Apex Protocol''===\n\nFollowing a major tsunami known as the Pacific disaster, the paramilitary crime syndicate, the Syndikat, rose to power in several regions on Tanoa. Finding the Syndikat's rapid expansion suspicious, NATO sends in CTRG Group 15 to investigate.\n\nCTRG Group 15, under callsign \"Raider\", deploys on Tanoa and conducts several operations against the Syndikat, destroying a Syndikat ammo depot and ambushing a Syndikat convoy. They discover evidence of CSAT support of the Syndikat. During an operation to capture the Syndikat's leader, Solomon Maru, Raider instead finds that they've been led into an ambush by the Chinese CSAT special forces Viper Team. Raider manages to escape from the ambush.\n\nFollowing the ambush, Raider conducts an operation to rescue CTRG asset \"Keystone\". Keystone turns out to be Captain Scott Miller, leader of CTRG Group 14, who had been tracking the special CSAT device since it left Altis, which is a [[tectonic weapon]] codenamed \"Eastwind\". Miller believes that Viper deployed Eastwind on Tanoa, causing the Pacific disaster, and supported the Syndikat, all to destabilize Tanoa.\n\nAfter rescuing Miller, CTRG raids a Viper black site on Tanoa to retrieve Eastwind. They find the black site already attacked and abandoned; Syndikat double-crossed CSAT before CTRG arrived, holding Eastwind ransom to blackmail against CSAT. CTRG did however recover files about CSAT's \"Apex Protocol,\" which involves using operatives to destabilize strategically important nations so CSAT can provide assistance and foster CSAT support.\n\nCTRG tracks Eastwind to a large port, where CSAT attempts to deal with Syndikat to recover Eastwind, while Maru arms Eastwind. CTRG quickly attacks, fighting against both Syndikat and Viper, and manages to kill Maru, disarm Eastwind, and secure the device. Following the operation, CSAT's Apex Protocol is exposed to the whole world, leading to international condemnation, while Eastwind is now in NATO's possession.\n\n===''Remnants of War''===\n\nDays after the end of the NATO invasion of Altis, a civilian mechanic from the Altis town of Oreokastro returns to the town, after hearing news that his missing brother had appeared at the town's church in a recent firefight. As he searches the church, he is killed by a landmine.\n\nSeveral days later, journalist Katherine Bishop conducts an online interview with Nathan MacDade as he works on the disposal of [[explosive remnants of war]] at Oreokastro. Oreokastro, formerly a major FIA garrison and the site of an IDAP camp, was completely destroyed during the war and is now a [[ghost town]]. Nathan reminisces about Oreokastro's past as he conducts his work, and tells five stories surrounding Oreokastro during the war.\n\n* In the first story, after the breakdown of the FIA-AAF ceasefire, NATO peacekeeper Staff Sergeant Adams led a TF Aegis squad to secure a NATO [[airdrop]] intended for the Oreokastro IDAP camp, and repelled an attack from FIA bandits.\n* In the second story, a FIA fighter from Oreokastro, Alexis Kouris, sets up defenses around Oreokastro after the AAF announced their plans to assault the town.\n* In the third story, Nathan recounts a rumor that a squad of supposed CSAT special forces parachuted in near Oreokastro and [[Laser designator|designated]] FIA positions in the town for an AAF [[cluster bomb]] air strike, destroying much of the town. Nathan notes that NATO casings were discovered on site, and it is implied that the special forces may have been Miller's CTRG team instead.\n* In the fourth story, Markos Kouris, Alexis' brother and a [[non-combatant]] at Oreokastro, was heavily injured by the AAF air strike. As the AAF assaults the town, Markos limps his way to the IDAP camp at the town church, and was eventually evacuated. The town is abandoned after the assault.\n* In the final story, set during the NATO invasion of Altis, AAF officers Lieutenant Antoniou Dimitriou and Major Gavras were overwhelmed by NATO-FIA forces and were pushed back to Oreokastro. The two defend themselves at the town's church, and deploy landmines for self defense. They withstand the attack and extract. Alexis is one of the casualties in the assault, leading Markos to search the church after the war, resulting in him being killed by leftover landmines.\n\nBack at present, Katherine asks Nathan about who he thinks is most responsible for the destruction of Oreokastro: NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA, or nobody. After Nathan responds, Katherine shows Nathan a draft of her report on the impacts the war had left on the life on Altis, the contents reflecting on the player's actions throughout the campaign. As Nathan completes the EOD operation, he bides Katherine farewell as he and his team pack up and leave Oreokastro, proceeding to their next cleanup site.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:James Crowe Bohemia Interactive.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jay Crowe was the game's creative director and provided some voice acting for the game.]]\nBohemia Interactive officially announced the development of ''ARMA 3'' on May 19, 2011.<ref name=\"arma3anounced\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/bohemia-interactive-oznamuje-arma-3-55791|title=ARMA 3 announced|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012 an [[Alpha release|alpha version]] of the game was demonstrated at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].<ref name=\"alpha-e3\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tv/arma-3-e3-2012-rozhovor-6419|title=Arma 3 shown during E3 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Bohemia Interactive announced that they will release three [[downloadable content]] episodes for free after the game's initial launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arma3.com/news/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-3-free-dlc-episodes|title=Free DLC|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> An alpha version of the game was released on March 5, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience.

In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black. In the South, white schools had only white pupils and teachers, while black schools had only black teachers and black students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools|title=Jim Crow's Schools|date=2014-08-08|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome [[streetcar]] companies did not segregate voluntarily.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods. To build a highway, tens of thousands of single-family homes were destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Because these properties were summarily declared to be \"in decline,\" families were given pittances for their properties, and were forced into federal housing called \"the projects\".

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963. It prohibited marriage between a white and anyone considered a [[Negro]] ([[Black American]]), [[mulatto]] (half black), [[quadroon]] (one-quarter black), octoroon (one-eighth black), \"[[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]]\" (East Asian), or member of the \"[[Malay race]]\" (a classification used to refer to [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]).

These forced measures promoted poverty levels to rise and belittle blacks.\n\nMassey and Denton proposed that the fundamental cause of [[poverty among African Americans]] is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create [[poverty trap]]s and keep blacks from being able to escape the underclass. It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation of the black community.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev.

In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid.

In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy.

U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree.

National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods.

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963.

These forced measures promoted poverty levels to rise and belittle blacks.\n\nMassey and Denton proposed that the fundamental cause of [[poverty among African Americans]] is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create [[poverty trap]]s and keep blacks from being able to escape the underclass. It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation of the black community.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev.

In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid.

In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy.

U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree.

National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots.

Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, \"There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.\"<ref>\"Acting White\". By Roland G. Fryer, Jr. Education Next. Winter 2006 (vol. 6, no. 1).</ref> Therefore, not only are there economic and prehistoric causes of racial educational segregation, but there are also social notions that continue to be obstacles to be overcome before minority groups can achieve success in education.\n\nMississippi is one of the US states where some public schools still remain highly segregated just like the 1960s when discrimination against black people was very rampant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/history-of-segregation-still-evident-in-mississippi-region-1.3181796|title=History of segregation still evident in Mississippi region|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In many communities where black kids represent the majority, white children are the only ones who enroll in small private schools.

The state was more segregated for black students compared to any other Southern state. There is a case of double segregation because students have become isolated both by race and household income. In New York City, 19 out of 32 school districts have fewer white students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/new-york-schools-segregated_n_5034455.html|title=The Nation's Most Segregated Schools Aren't Where You'd Think They'd Be|last=Resmovits|first=Joy|date=2014-03-26|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court tried to deal with school segregation more than six decades ago but impoverished and colored students still do not have equal access to opportunities in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment|title=History \u2013 Brown v.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nOne study finds that an area's residential racial segregation increases metropolitan rates of black poverty and overall black-white [[income inequality in the United States|income disparities]], while decreasing rates of white poverty and [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] within the white population.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Wrong Side(s) of the Tracks: The Causal Effects of Racial Segregation on Urban Poverty and Inequality|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1945-7782|pages = 34\u201366|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.3.2.34|first = Elizabeth Oltmans|last = Ananat|citeseerx = 10.1.1.637.8290}}</ref>\n\n===Single parenthood===\nOne study finds that African-Americans who live in segregated metro areas have a higher likelihood of single-parenthood than Blacks who live in more integrated places.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/3/827|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 827\u2013872|volume = 112|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|first = David M.|last = Cutler|first2 = Edward L.|last2 = Glaeser}}</ref>\n\n===Public spending===\nResearch shows that segregation along racial lines contributes to public goods inequalities. Whites and blacks are vastly more likely to support different candidates for mayor than whites and blacks in more integrated places, which makes them less able to build consensus. The lack of consensus leads to lower levels of public spending.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods|journal = American Journal of Political Science|volume = 60|issue = 3|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 709\u2013725|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12227|first = Jessica|last = Trounstine|url = https://zenodo.org/record/894792}}</ref>\n\n=== Costs ===\nIn April 2017, the Metropolitan Planning Council in Chicago and the Urban Institute, a think-tank located in Washington, DC, released a study estimating that racial and economic segregation is costing the United States billions of dollars every year.

The king, however, absolved the regiment from this duty, saying that their loyalty had always been beyond question, and gave the officers the privilege of never drinking the Loyal Toast in the officers' mess and of ignoring the national anthem (they remain seated) when it is played by the band after dinner. This privilege was reaffirmed by the Sovereign prior to the formation of the regiment in 1993.<ref name=traditions>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/armoured/regiments/32494.aspx|title=Regimental traditions|publisher=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Badges and Symbols\n'''The White Horse of Hanover''':  Ranking second, after the Crown, among the regiment's military badges, it was bestowed by the first three Georges to certain regiments for their part in suppressing the Jacobites. It was first granted, as a special head-dress badge, by King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to The 3rd The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons in 1715 for their part in defeating [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (The Old Pretender).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qohmuseum.org.uk/whitehorse.htm|title=The White Horse of Hanover|publisher=The Queen's Own Hussars Museum|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Crossbelts''':  At the [[Battle of Almenar]] in 1710 the 8th Dragoons pursued the Spanish Cavalry Corps and, equipping themselves with the crossbelts of the enemy, cut down the Spaniards with their own swords. The crossbelts were worn with distinction for many years, and the nickname 'St Georges Crossbelts' was given to the regiment. Although the crossbelt worn today is based on the original 4th Hussar pattern, the continuing tradition of titling the regimental journal ''The Crossbelts'' is in recognition of this famous action.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n[[Image:Grand CoA Warsaw.png|thumb|right|''The Maid of Warsaw'']]\n\n'''The Maid of Warsaw''':  Every member of the regiment wears [[the Maid of Warsaw]], the crest of the [[City of Warsaw]], on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. This honour was awarded to the [[7th Hussars]] by the [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders|Commander of the Second Polish Corps]] in recognition of their valour in support of the Polish forces during the Italian campaign in [[World War II]].  Traditionally the original crest presented to the regiment is placed in front of the commanding officer on Dinner Nights.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n'''The Fern Leaf''':  All vehicles in the regiment display the emblem of [[New Zealand]], the fern leaf, to commemorate the association of The [[3rd Hussars]] with the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] where the regiment lost all but five tanks breaching the German line. This honour was granted by [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|General Lord Freyberg VC]].<ref name=traditions/>\n\n'''Kettle Drums''':  By command of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] the silver kettle drums captured by The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons, later The [[3rd Hussars]], at Dettingen are borne by a drum horse ridden by a sergeant kettledrummer - both being additional to the regimental establishment. The drums are always carried at the head of the regiment on ceremonial parades and are, uniquely amongst cavalry regiments, never covered by drum banners, the battle honours being engraved directly onto the sides of the drums. In 1772 when [[Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton|Lord Southampton]] commanded the regiment, his wife gave a silver collar to be worn by the kettledrummer, which is still worn today when parading in full dress with the drums. The present drum horse is named Alamein and its nickname is Dudley.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n;Other traditions\n\n[[Image:Winston Churchill 1874 - 1965 ZZZ5426F.jpg|thumb|right|Winston Churchill 1895]]\n\n'''Winston Churchill''':  [[Winston Churchill]], who has been described as 'the greatest Hussar of them all', was commissioned into the [[4th Hussars]] in 1895, and later became the colonel of the regiment from 1941, until the 4th Queen's Own Hussars was amalgamated with the 8th Hussars in 1958, after which he became colonel of the new regiment, Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, remaining so until his death in 1965. In recognition of this, the Churchill Cup is awarded to the top-scoring troop in the regiment's annual gunnery competition. The commanding officer's tank is also named 'Churchill'.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n;Regimental Colours\nThe colours are as follows:<ref name=traditions/>\n*''Garter Blue'': The primary colour of the regiment is garter blue. This dates from when the Queen Consort's Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd Hussars, wore the queen's livery with garter blue feathered hats. It has been in continuous use ever since.\n*''Green'': The use of green dates from 1748 when it was the facing colour of Princess Anne of Denmark's Regiment of Dragoons, later the 4th Hussars. It has an association with Ireland, which remains a recruiting area for the regiment. Officers and senior ranks wear green jumpers and all ranks wear green berets. Officers can be distinguished by their distinctive tent hats (the only item of army headdress worn without a cap badge other than with combat uniforms).\n*''Yellow'':  The traditional [[Light Cavalry]] colour is yellow, which has been used by all of the regiment's predecessors.\n\n;Regimental song\nThe lyrics of the song go:<ref name=empire/><br />\nI'm a soldier in the Queen's Army.<br />\nI'm a galloping Queen's Hussar.<br />\nI've sailed the ocean wide and blue.<br />\nI'm a chap who knows a thing or two.<br />\nBeen in many a tight corner.<br />\nShown the enemy who we are.<br />\nI can ride a horse.<br />\nGo on a spree, or sing a comic song.<br />\nAnd that denotes a Queen's Hussar.\n\n[[File:Tpr Paul J Ashfield.jpg|thumb|Tpr Paul J Ashfield, 1999 Royal Tournament]]\n[[File:redoubt2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Eastbourne Redoubt]] South Seaward facade]]\n\n===The Regimental Pipes and Drums===\nThe Pipes and Drums were inherited from the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars.

The king, however, absolved the regiment from this duty, saying that their loyalty had always been beyond question, and gave the officers the privilege of never drinking the Loyal Toast in the officers' mess and of ignoring the national anthem (they remain seated) when it is played by the band after dinner. This privilege was reaffirmed by the Sovereign prior to the formation of the regiment in 1993.<ref name=traditions>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/armoured/regiments/32494.aspx|title=Regimental traditions|publisher=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Badges and Symbols\n'''The White Horse of Hanover''':  Ranking second, after the Crown, among the regiment's military badges, it was bestowed by the first three Georges to certain regiments for their part in suppressing the Jacobites. It was first granted, as a special head-dress badge, by King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to The 3rd The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons in 1715 for their part in defeating [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (The Old Pretender).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qohmuseum.org.uk/whitehorse.htm|title=The White Horse of Hanover|publisher=The Queen's Own Hussars Museum|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Crossbelts''':  At the [[Battle of Almenar]] in 1710 the 8th Dragoons pursued the Spanish Cavalry Corps and, equipping themselves with the crossbelts of the enemy, cut down the Spaniards with their own swords. The crossbelts were worn with distinction for many years, and the nickname 'St Georges Crossbelts' was given to the regiment. Although the crossbelt worn today is based on the original 4th Hussar pattern, the continuing tradition of titling the regimental journal ''The Crossbelts'' is in recognition of this famous action.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n[[Image:Grand CoA Warsaw.png|thumb|right|''The Maid of Warsaw'']]\n\n'''The Maid of Warsaw''':  Every member of the regiment wears [[the Maid of Warsaw]], the crest of the [[City of Warsaw]], on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. This honour was awarded to the [[7th Hussars]] by the [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders|Commander of the Second Polish Corps]] in recognition of their valour in support of the Polish forces during the Italian campaign in [[World War II]].  Traditionally the original crest presented to the regiment is placed in front of the commanding officer on Dinner Nights.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n'''The Fern Leaf''':  All vehicles in the regiment display the emblem of [[New Zealand]], the fern leaf, to commemorate the association of The [[3rd Hussars]] with the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] where the regiment lost all but five tanks breaching the German line. This honour was granted by [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|General Lord Freyberg VC]].<ref name=traditions/>\n\n'''Kettle Drums''':  By command of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] the silver kettle drums captured by The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons, later The [[3rd Hussars]], at Dettingen are borne by a drum horse ridden by a sergeant kettledrummer - both being additional to the regimental establishment. The drums are always carried at the head of the regiment on ceremonial parades and are, uniquely amongst cavalry regiments, never covered by drum banners, the battle honours being engraved directly onto the sides of the drums. In 1772 when [[Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton|Lord Southampton]] commanded the regiment, his wife gave a silver collar to be worn by the kettledrummer, which is still worn today when parading in full dress with the drums. The present drum horse is named Alamein and its nickname is Dudley.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n;Other traditions\n\n[[Image:Winston Churchill 1874 - 1965 ZZZ5426F.jpg|thumb|right|Winston Churchill 1895]]\n\n'''Winston Churchill''':  [[Winston Churchill]], who has been described as 'the greatest Hussar of them all', was commissioned into the [[4th Hussars]] in 1895, and later became the colonel of the regiment from 1941, until the 4th Queen's Own Hussars was amalgamated with the 8th Hussars in 1958, after which he became colonel of the new regiment, Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, remaining so until his death in 1965. In recognition of this, the Churchill Cup is awarded to the top-scoring troop in the regiment's annual gunnery competition. The commanding officer's tank is also named 'Churchill'.<ref name=traditions/>\n\n;Regimental Colours\nThe colours are as follows:<ref name=traditions/>\n*''Garter Blue'': The primary colour of the regiment is garter blue. This dates from when the Queen Consort's Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd Hussars, wore the queen's livery with garter blue feathered hats. It has been in continuous use ever since.\n*''Green'': The use of green dates from 1748 when it was the facing colour of Princess Anne of Denmark's Regiment of Dragoons, later the 4th Hussars. It has an association with Ireland, which remains a recruiting area for the regiment. Officers and senior ranks wear green jumpers and all ranks wear green berets. Officers can be distinguished by their distinctive tent hats (the only item of army headdress worn without a cap badge other than with combat uniforms).\n*''Yellow'':  The traditional [[Light Cavalry]] colour is yellow, which has been used by all of the regiment's predecessors.\n\n;Regimental song\nThe lyrics of the song go:<ref name=empire/><br />\nI'm a soldier in the Queen's Army.<br />\nI'm a galloping Queen's Hussar.<br />\nI've sailed the ocean wide and blue.<br />\nI'm a chap who knows a thing or two.<br />\nBeen in many a tight corner.<br />\nShown the enemy who we are.<br />\nI can ride a horse.<br />\nGo on a spree, or sing a comic song.<br />\nAnd that denotes a Queen's Hussar.\n\n[[File:Tpr Paul J Ashfield.jpg|thumb|Tpr Paul J Ashfield, 1999 Royal Tournament]]\n[[File:redoubt2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Eastbourne Redoubt]] South Seaward facade]]\n\n===The Regimental Pipes and Drums===\nThe Pipes and Drums were inherited from the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars.

From there they moved to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Roy studied at the [[University of Denver]].  In the 1950s, the Peratroviches moved to [[Oklahoma]], and then back to Alaska.\n\nElizabeth Peratrovich died of cancer on December 1, 1958. She is buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Juneau, Alaska alongside her husband Roy.\n\nSon [[Roy Peratrovich, Jr.]], became a noted civil engineer in Alaska.  He designed the [[Brotherhood Bridge]] in Juneau, which carries the [[Alaska Route 7|Glacier Highway]] over the [[Mendenhall River]].  In 1979, he co-founded the firm Peratrovich Nottingham & Drage, now known as PND Engineers.  After retiring from the engineering profession, he now works as an artist based on [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]].\n\n==Anti-Discrimination Act==\nIn 1941, while living in Juneau, the Peratroviches found more discrimination, having difficulty finding housing and seeing signs banning Native entry to public facilities. They petitioned the territorial governor, [[Ernest Gruening]], to ban the \"No Natives Allowed\" signs then common at public accommodations in that city and elsewhere.<!--Most accounts state that the common form of the sign read \"No Natives or dogs allowed,\" and/or the other way around.-->  The Anti-Discrimination Act was defeated by the territorial legislature in 1943.  As leaders of the [[Alaska Native Brotherhood/Sisterhood|Alaska Native Brotherhood and the Alaska Native Sisterhood]], the Peratroviches lobbied the territory's legislators and represented their organizations in their testimony.\n\nElizabeth Peratrovich was the last to testify before the territorial Senate voted on the bill in 1945, and her impassioned testimony was considered decisive.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&CISOPTR=2058&REC=22|title=Super race theory hit at hearing|last=Monsen|first=Helen Troy|newspaper=The Alaska Daily Empire|location=Juneau|page=8|publication-date=6 February 1945|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I would not have expected that I, who am barely out of savagery, would have to remind gentlemen with five thousand years of recorded civilization behind them, of our [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]].<ref name=\"Ulmer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/native_gov/recollections/peratrovich/Honoring_EPeratrovich.htm|title=Honoring Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich|first=Fran|last=Ulmer|authorlink=Fran Ulmer|date=May 1, 1992|work=[[Alaska House of Representatives]]|publisher=[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] Institute of Social and Economic Research|location=[[Anchorage]]|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nShe was responding to earlier comments by territorial senator Allen Shattuck of Juneau.

From there they moved to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Roy studied at the [[University of Denver]].  In the 1950s, the Peratroviches moved to [[Oklahoma]], and then back to Alaska.\n\nElizabeth Peratrovich died of cancer on December 1, 1958. She is buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Juneau, Alaska alongside her husband Roy.\n\nSon [[Roy Peratrovich, Jr.]], became a noted civil engineer in Alaska.  He designed the [[Brotherhood Bridge]] in Juneau, which carries the [[Alaska Route 7|Glacier Highway]] over the [[Mendenhall River]].  In 1979, he co-founded the firm Peratrovich Nottingham & Drage, now known as PND Engineers.  After retiring from the engineering profession, he now works as an artist based on [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]].\n\n==Anti-Discrimination Act==\nIn 1941, while living in Juneau, the Peratroviches found more discrimination, having difficulty finding housing and seeing signs banning Native entry to public facilities. They petitioned the territorial governor, [[Ernest Gruening]], to ban the \"No Natives Allowed\" signs then common at public accommodations in that city and elsewhere.<!--Most accounts state that the common form of the sign read \"No Natives or dogs allowed,\" and/or the other way around.-->  The Anti-Discrimination Act was defeated by the territorial legislature in 1943.  As leaders of the [[Alaska Native Brotherhood/Sisterhood|Alaska Native Brotherhood and the Alaska Native Sisterhood]], the Peratroviches lobbied the territory's legislators and represented their organizations in their testimony.\n\nElizabeth Peratrovich was the last to testify before the territorial Senate voted on the bill in 1945, and her impassioned testimony was considered decisive.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&CISOPTR=2058&REC=22|title=Super race theory hit at hearing|last=Monsen|first=Helen Troy|newspaper=The Alaska Daily Empire|location=Juneau|page=8|publication-date=6 February 1945|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I would not have expected that I, who am barely out of savagery, would have to remind gentlemen with five thousand years of recorded civilization behind them, of our [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]].<ref name=\"Ulmer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/native_gov/recollections/peratrovich/Honoring_EPeratrovich.htm|title=Honoring Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich|first=Fran|last=Ulmer|authorlink=Fran Ulmer|date=May 1, 1992|work=[[Alaska House of Representatives]]|publisher=[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] Institute of Social and Economic Research|location=[[Anchorage]]|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nShe was responding to earlier comments by territorial senator Allen Shattuck of Juneau.

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist. Meats and fish were [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], dried, or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to [[pickling|pickle]] items such as [[herring]], and to cure [[pork]]. [[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency.<ref>Capatti, 158\u2013159.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]]. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a \"Treatise on the Potato\" after the French [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]]'s successful promotion of the tuber.<ref>De Conte, 17</ref> In 1790, [[Francesco Leonardi (Chef)|Francesco Leonardi]] in his book ''L'Apicio moderno'' (\"Modern [[Apicius]]\") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato-based sauce.<ref>Faccioli, 753</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]], wrote ''A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie'' with recipes \"suitable for a modest household\". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as ''Genoese Cappon Magro''. In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.<ref>De Conte, 18\u201319</ref>\n\n''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (''The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well''), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes predominantly originate from [[Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]], where he lived.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:BasilkumPesto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pesto]], a Ligurian sauce made out of basil, olive oil and pine nuts, and which can be eaten with pasta or other dishes such as soup.]]\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or [[baccal\u00e0]]), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | authorlink=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Manuali | last2=Tania | title=Lidia Cooks from the Heart of Italy: A Feast of 175 Regional Recipes | edition=1st}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | authorlink=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Mariani | last2=John | title=How Italian Food Conquered the World | edition=1st}}</ref> Italians like their ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/16/ten-commandments-of-italian-cooking|title=Ten commandments of Italian cooking|last=Conte|first=Anna Del|date=16 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Northern Italy]] though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/regionalcuisines1/ss/northeastern.htm|title=Northern Regional Cuisines|author=Kyle Phillips|work=About}}</ref> Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes.

In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham ([[prosciutto]]), sausage ([[cotechino Modena|cotechino]]), different sorts of [[salami]], truffles, [[Grana (cheese)|grana]], [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]], and [[tomato]]es ([[Bolognese sauce]] or [[rag\u00f9]]).\n[[File:Italian olive oil 2007.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.35|[[Olive oil]] is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Italian cooking, and as the basis for sauces, often replaces animal fats of butter or lard.<ref name=\"May2005\">{{cite book|last=May|first=Tony|title=Italian Cuisine: The New Essential Reference to the Riches of the Italian Table|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tAafwz2YcQC&pg=PA7|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-30280-1|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>]]\n\nTraditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

The [[S\u00fcdtirol]] cuisine has strong [[Alps|alpine]] regional and [[Austria]]n influence]]\nBefore the [[Council of Trent]] in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] came in.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\">Piras, 67.</ref>\n\nThe [[Trentino]] subregion produces various types of sausages, polenta, yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake, and freshwater fish. In the [[S\u00fcdtirol]] (Alto Adige) subregion, due to the German-speaking majority population, strong Austrian and Slavic influences prevail. The most renowned local product is traditional ''[[speck]]'' juniper-flavored ham which, as [[Speck Alto Adige PGI|Speck Alto Adige]], is regulated by the [[European Union]] under the [[protected geographical indication]] (PGI) status. [[Goulash]], ''[[kn\u00f6del]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[kaiserschmarrn]]'', ''[[krapfen]]'', ''[[r\u00f6sti]]'', ''[[sp\u00e4tzle]]'', and [[rye bread]] are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade [[sauerkraut]], and lard.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\" /> The territory of [[Bolzano]] is also reputed for its [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] white wines.\n\n=== Tuscany ===\n[[File:Finocchiona from Tuscany.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Finocchiona]]'', a classic southern Tuscan Salami]]\n\nSimplicity is central to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes. Regional desserts include ''[[panforte]]'' (prepared with honey, fruits, and nuts), ''[[ricciarelli]]'' (biscuits made using an almond base with sugar, honey, and egg white), and ''[[cavallucci]]'' (cookies made with almonds, candied fruits, coriander, flour, and honey).

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

The ''primo'' (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist. Meats and fish were [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], dried, or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to [[pickling|pickle]] items such as [[herring]], and to cure [[pork]]. [[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables.

It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]].

In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.<ref>De Conte, 18\u201319</ref>\n\n''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (''The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well''), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes predominantly originate from [[Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]], where he lived.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:BasilkumPesto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pesto]], a Ligurian sauce made out of basil, olive oil and pine nuts, and which can be eaten with pasta or other dishes such as soup.]]\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or [[baccal\u00e0]]), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients.

In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

Regional desserts include ''[[zuppa inglese]]'' (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and [[Alchermes]] liqueur) and ''[[panpepato]]'' (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds).\n\n=== Friuli-Venezia Giulia ===\n[[File:Jota 02.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Istrian stew|Jota]]'' is a traditional stew in the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Venezia Giulia]] region]]\n\n[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] conserved, in its cuisine, the historical links with [[Austria-Hungary]]. [[Province of Udine|Udine]] and [[Province of Pordenone|Pordenone]], in the western part of Friuli, are known for their traditional [[San Daniele del Friuli]] [[ham]], [[Montasio]] cheese, and [[Frico]] cheese. Other typical dishes are ''[[pitina]]'' (meatballs made of smoked meats), game, and various types of ''[[gnocchi]]'' and ''[[polenta]]''.\n\nThe majority of the eastern regional dishes are heavily influenced by Austrian, Hungarian, Slovene and Croatian cuisines: typical dishes include [[Istrian Stew]] (soup of beans, sauerkraut, potatoes, bacon, and spare ribs), [[Vienna sausages]], ''[[goulash]]'', ''[[\u0107evapi]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[gugelhupf]]''. Pork can be spicy and is often prepared over an open hearth called a ''fogolar''. [[Collio Goriziano]], [[Friuli Isonzo]], [[Colli Orientali del Friuli]], and [[Ramandolo]] are well-known [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] regional wines.\n\n=== Liguria ===\n[[File:Rosemary Focaccia.jpg|thumb|''[[Focaccia]]'' with rosemary. Focaccia is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine]]\n\n[[Liguria]] is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. [[Umami|Savory]] pies are popular, mixing greens and [[artichoke]]s along with cheeses, milk curds, and eggs. [[Onion]]s and [[olive oil]] are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use [[chickpea]]s in ''[[farinata]]'' and polenta-like ''[[panissa]]''. The former is served plain or topped with onions, [[artichoke]]s, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\">Piras, 167, 177.</ref>\n\nHilly districts use [[chestnut]]s as a source of carbohydrates. Ligurian pastas include ''corzetti'' from the [[Val Polcevera|Polcevera valley]]; ''pansoti'', a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables; ''piccagge'', pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and served with artichoke sauce or ''[[pesto]]'' sauce; ''[[trenette]]'', made from [[whole wheat flour]] cut into long strips and served with pesto; boiled beans and potatoes; and ''trofie'', a Ligurian ''[[gnocchi]]'' made from whole grain flour and boiled potatoes, made into a spiral shape and often tossed in ''pesto''.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\" /> Many Ligurians emigrated to [[Argentina]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing the cuisine of the country (which was otherwise dominated by meat and dairy products that the narrow Ligurian hinterland would have not allowed).\n\n=== Lazio ===\n{{Main|Roman cuisine}}\n[[File:Spaghetti carbonara.jpg|right|thumb|Spaghetti ''[[carbonara|alla carbonara]]'']]\n\nPasta dishes based on the use of ''[[guanciale]]'' (unsmoked bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks) are often found in [[Lazio]], such as pasta [[carbonara|''alla carbonara'']] and pasta ''[[Sugo all'amatriciana|all'amatriciana]]''. Another pasta dish of the region is ''[[arrabbiata]]'', with spicy tomato sauce.

Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as ''[[risotto]]''. The best-known version is ''risotto alla milanese'', flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as ''[[ossobuco]] alla milanese'' (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and ''[[cotoletta]] alla milanese'' (a fried cutlet similar to [[Wiener schnitzel]], but cooked \"bone-in\").<ref name=\"Piras, 87\">Piras, 87.</ref>\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[cassoeula]]'' (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), [[Cremona]]'s [[Mostarda]] (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), [[Valtellina]]'s [[bresaola]] (air-dried salted beef) and [[pizzoccheri]] (a flat ribbon pasta made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes, and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese), and [[Mantua]]'s ''tortelli di zucca'' (''[[ravioli]]'' with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.<ref name=\"Piras, 87\" />\n\nRegional cheeses include [[Robiola]], [[Crescenza]], [[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]], [[Gorgonzola cheese|Gorgonzola]], and [[Grana Padano]] (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle farming). ''[[Polenta]]'' is common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous ''[[panettone]]'' Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked).\n\n=== Marche ===\nOn the coast of [[Marche]], fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and [[ham]]s. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. [[Suckling pig]], [[chicken]], and [[fish]] are often stuffed with [[rosemary]] or [[fennel]] fronds and [[garlic]] before being roasted or placed on the spit.<ref>Piras, 273</ref>\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for ''olive all'ascolana'', (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).<ref name=\"GURI\">[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/10061dl.htm] Provvedimento 15 febbraio 2006: Iscrizione della denominazione \u00abOliva Ascolana del Piceno\u00bb nel registro delle denominazioni di origine protette e delle indicazioni geografiche protette, ''GURI n. 46''</ref> Another well-known Marche product are the ''[[:it:Maccheroncini di Campofilone|Maccheroncini di Campofilone]]'', from little town of [[Campofilone]], a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth.\n\n=== Piedmont ===\n[[File:Agnolotti.JPG|thumb|left|Traditional Piedmontese ''[[agnolotti]]'']]\n\nBetween the Alps and the [[Po valley]], featuring a large number of different ecosystems, the Piedmont region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. As a point of union between traditional Italian and French cuisine, [[Piedmont]] is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses with [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical status]] and wines under [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]].

Wines from the [[Nebbiolo]] grape such as [[Barolo]] and [[Barbaresco]] are produced as well as wines from the [[Barbera]] grape, fine [[sparkling wine]]s, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, [[Moscato d'Asti]]. The region is also famous for its [[Vermouth]] and [[Ratafia]] production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Castelmagno (cheese)|Castelmagno]] is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its [[Carr\u00f9]] beef (particularly ''bue grasso'', \"fat ox\"), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon, and salt; [[carpaccio]]; Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef; and boiled beef served with various sauces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are the traditional ''[[agnolotti]]'' (pasta folded over with roast beef and vegetable stuffing), ''paniscia'' (a typical dish of [[Novara]], a kind of [[risotto]] with [[Arborio rice]] or [[Maratelli]] rice, the typical kind of [[Saluggia]] beans, onion, [[Barbera]] wine, lard, salami, season vegetables, salt and pepper), ''[[taglierini]]'' (thinner version of tagliatelle), ''[[bagna cauda]]'' (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil, and butter), and ''[[bicerin]]'' (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate, and whole milk).

Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes.

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. [[Limoncello]], a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy ([[Sorrento]], [[Amalfi]] and the [[Gulf of Naples]]) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.luxuryretreats.com/everything-need-know-drinking-limoncello-italy/|title=Drinking Limoncello in Italy|date=8 December 2017|website=Luxury Retreats Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Amaro Averna|Amaro Sicilianos]] are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. [[Mirto (liqueur)|Mirto]], an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in [[Sardinia]] and other regions. Another well-known digestif is [[Amaro Lucano]] from [[Basilicata]].<ref>Piras, 383.</ref>\n\n[[Grappa]] is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the [[Alps]] and of the [[Po Valley]]. The most famous grappas are distilled in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Veneto]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Trentino]]. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are [[Martini & Rossi|Martini]], [[Vermouth]], and [[Campari]]. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for [[Champagne (wine)|French champagne]] is [[prosecco]], from the Veneto region.<ref name=\"Atkin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/11/foodanddrink1|title=The fizz that's the bizz|last=Atkin|first=Tim, ''The Observer'' |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2008|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name=\"Dane\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10272259.html|title=Pop the Cork on Prosecco|last=Dane|first=Ana, ''TheStreet.com'' |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Desserts ==\n{{Main|List of Italian desserts}}\n{{See also|List of Italian dishes#Desserts and pastry|l1=List of Italian dishes\u2014Desserts and pastry}}\n{{See also|Sicilian cuisine#Desserts and sweets|l1=Sicilian cuisine\u2014Desserts and sweets}}\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and [[candy]] belong to the same category of sweets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 364\u2013365] |url=https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 }}</ref> Traditional candies include [[candied fruit]]s, [[torrone]], and [[nut brittle]]s, all of which are still popular in the modern era.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

However, they lend their voices to the Wonderland characters, and the staging of the scenes in England vs. the scenes in Wonderland is reminiscent of the Kansas scenes vs. the Oz scenes in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in that several of the live-action characters seem to have counterparts (of sorts) in Wonderland. Among the other live actors are [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]] as the Queen and as the voice of the Queen of Hearts. [[Stephen Murray (actor)|Stephen Murray]] is seen as Lewis Carroll and provides the voice of the Knave of Hearts, and [[Felix Aylmer]], who played Polonius in [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', plays Dr. Liddell, father of Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Alice; he also provides the voice of the Cheshire Cat.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042189/</ref>\n\n[[Carol Marsh]] was 20 years old when she played the part of Alice - conceived by the novel's author as 7 years old.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Victorian England]], Charles Dodgson is a scholar and teacher at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] who enjoys photography, theatre, and spending time with the young daughters of Dr. Liddell, the [[Dean of Christ Church|Dean]]. The stuffy Vice Chancellor thinks little of Dodgson and is appalled at the subject of his latest poem (written under the [[pen name]] Lewis Carroll), suggesting that Oxford's famous bell [[Tom Tower|Great Tom]] be removed as its ringing is a nuisance to many. He fears Dodgson will read it to [[Queen Victoria|the Queen]], who is soon to be visiting Oxford. On the suggestion of the Vice Chancellor, [[Alice Liddell]] and her sisters are not allowed to be present when the Queen arrives as he believes they will make things disorderly. Dodgson feels bad for the disappointed Alice and slips one of the Queen's tarts to her while no one is looking. When he meets the Queen, Dodgson cannot find the courage to tell her his true opinion of Great Tom.\n\nDodgson takes the Dean's daughters on a boat ride. He begins to tell a story about a little girl named Alice who sees a [[White Rabbit]] in a waistcoat looking at a pocket watch. Curious, Alice follows him down a large rabbit hole. Landing in a room with many doors, Alice discovers a key she uses to open a tiny door through which she spies the Rabbit. In her attempt to get inside the door, Alice uses magical objects that mysteriously appear in the room to change her size. She grows enormously tall and cries at her predicament, then shrinks until she is small enough to enter the door but finds herself floating in a sea of her own tears. Alice meets [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|a mouse]], to whom she relates her feelings of delight at the fantastic world she has found herself in.\n\nUpon washing ashore, Alice sees animals having a Caucus Race and debating on the best way to get dry. Blaming Alice for the flood, the animals begin to chase her. Alice encounters the Rabbit again, who mistakes her for his maidservant and tells her to fetch a fan and gloves from his house. Alice takes a bottle from a table in the Rabbit's house and drinks from it. She grows so much that she becomes stuck in the house. The Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb down the chimney to take care of the problem. When that doesn't work, he throws a pebble and it turns into a cake that makes Alice shrink. She escapes the house, which then collapses. The horrified Rabbit and his gardeners join the Caucus Race animals in pursuit of Alice. The card army of the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King]] and [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] inform the animals that the Queen's tarts have been stolen. The Rabbit frames Alice for the theft and everyone agrees that she is responsible. Wandering in the woods, Alice encounters a giant puppy with a bell around its neck and a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]]. She then sees fish footmen carrying an invitation from the Queen to [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the Duchess]] to play [[croquet]].\n\nThe [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] sneaks through the woods carrying the Queen's tarts which he stole. When the Rabbit discovers him, he begs him not to tell the Queen what he did. The Rabbit acts as if he saw nothing as he takes one of the tarts for himself. Alice gains entrance into the house of the Duchess and gives her the Queen's invitation. The amount of pepper the Duchess's cook is using in her soup causes everyone to sneeze, making the house explode. The Duchess's baby flies through the air and is caught by Alice. It begins grunting and she discovers it has turned into a pig. She leaves it to wander away. The [[Cheshire Cat]] appears and directs Alice to the [[Mad Hatter]], [[March Hare]], and [[The Dormouse|the Dormouse]], who are having a tea party. The Hatter leaps onto the table and recites a song he sang at a concert given by the Queen. Alice sees the animals coming and takes off, ending up in the room of doors once again.

Directed by [[Dallas Bower]], the film stars [[Carol Marsh]] as Alice, [[Stephen Murray (actor)|Stephen Murray]] as [[Lewis Carroll]], and [[Raymond Bussi\u00e8res]] as The Tailor. Most of the Wonderland characters are portrayed by [[stop motion|stop-motion]] animated puppets created by [[Lou Bunin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/alice-in-wonderland-133363/cast|work=Allmovie|title=Alice in Wonderland: Cast|accessdate=29 September 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630103440/http://allmovie.com/work/alice-in-wonderland-133363/cast|archive-date=30 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/alice-in-wonderland-133363|author=Erickson, Hal|title=Alice in Wonderland:Overview|accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nAll of the other live actors in the film are seen only in the live action scenes. However, they lend their voices to the Wonderland characters, and the staging of the scenes in England vs. the scenes in Wonderland is reminiscent of the Kansas scenes vs. the Oz scenes in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in that several of the live-action characters seem to have counterparts (of sorts) in Wonderland. Among the other live actors are [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]] as the Queen and as the voice of the Queen of Hearts. [[Stephen Murray (actor)|Stephen Murray]] is seen as Lewis Carroll and provides the voice of the Knave of Hearts, and [[Felix Aylmer]], who played Polonius in [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', plays Dr. Liddell, father of Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Alice; he also provides the voice of the Cheshire Cat.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042189/</ref>\n\n[[Carol Marsh]] was 20 years old when she played the part of Alice - conceived by the novel's author as 7 years old.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Victorian England]], Charles Dodgson is a scholar and teacher at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] who enjoys photography, theatre, and spending time with the young daughters of Dr. Liddell, the [[Dean of Christ Church|Dean]]. The stuffy Vice Chancellor thinks little of Dodgson and is appalled at the subject of his latest poem (written under the pen name Lewis Carroll), suggesting that Oxford's famous bell [[Tom Tower|Great Tom]] be removed as its ringing is a nuisance to many. He fears Dodgson will read it to [[Queen Victoria|the Queen]], who is soon to be visiting Oxford. On the suggestion of the Vice Chancellor, [[Alice Liddell]] and her sisters are not allowed to be present when the Queen arrives as he believes they will make things disorderly. Dodgson feels bad for the disappointed Alice and slips one of the Queen's tarts to her while no one is looking. When he meets the Queen, Dodgson cannot find the courage to tell her his true opinion of Great Tom.\n\nDodgson takes the Dean's daughters on a boat ride. He begins to tell a story about a little girl named Alice who sees a [[White Rabbit]] in a waistcoat looking at a pocket watch. Curious, Alice follows him down a large rabbit hole. Landing in a room with many doors, Alice discovers a key she uses to open a tiny door through which she spies the Rabbit. In her attempt to get inside the door, Alice uses magical objects that mysteriously appear in the room to change her size. She grows enormously tall and cries at her predicament, then shrinks until she is small enough to enter the door but finds herself floating in a sea of her own tears. Alice meets [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|a mouse]], to whom she relates her feelings of delight at the fantastic world she has found herself in.\n\nUpon washing ashore, Alice sees animals having a Caucus Race and debating on the best way to get dry. Blaming Alice for the flood, the animals begin to chase her. Alice encounters the Rabbit again, who mistakes her for his maidservant and tells her to fetch a fan and gloves from his house. Alice takes a bottle from a table in the Rabbit's house and drinks from it. She grows so much that she becomes stuck in the house. The Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb down the chimney to take care of the problem. When that doesn't work, he throws a pebble and it turns into a cake that makes Alice shrink. She escapes the house, which then collapses. The horrified Rabbit and his gardeners join the Caucus Race animals in pursuit of Alice. The card army of the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King]] and [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] inform the animals that the Queen's tarts have been stolen. The Rabbit frames Alice for the theft and everyone agrees that she is responsible. Wandering in the woods, Alice encounters a giant puppy with a bell around its neck and a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]]. She then sees fish footmen carrying an invitation from the Queen to [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the Duchess]] to play [[croquet]].\n\nThe [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] sneaks through the woods carrying the Queen's tarts which he stole. When the Rabbit discovers him, he begs him not to tell the Queen what he did. The Rabbit acts as if he saw nothing as he takes one of the tarts for himself. Alice gains entrance into the house of the Duchess and gives her the Queen's invitation. The amount of pepper the Duchess's cook is using in her soup causes everyone to sneeze, making the house explode. The Duchess's baby flies through the air and is caught by Alice. It begins grunting and she discovers it has turned into a pig. She leaves it to wander away. The [[Cheshire Cat]] appears and directs Alice to the [[Mad Hatter]], [[March Hare]], and [[The Dormouse|the Dormouse]], who are having a tea party. The Hatter leaps onto the table and recites a song he sang at a concert given by the Queen. Alice sees the animals coming and takes off, ending up in the room of doors once again. Entering one, she is at the bottom of the sea where she watches a [[The Mock Turtle's Song|Lobster Quadrille]].\n\nThe Rabbit sees three of the Queen's gardeners painting white roses red to cover up their mistake of planting the wrong coloured rose tree. The gardeners plead with the Rabbit not to tell the Queen, saying that he was once in their position. The Rabbit smugly responds that, unlike them, he was clever enough to rise through the ranks and gain favour with the Queen. The King and Queen of Hearts arrive at the croquet court with their entourage. The Rabbit tells the Queen what the gardeners did and they are sent away to be beheaded. The Queen asks Alice to play croquet and then offers her a tart, but finds they are gone. The Rabbit accuses Alice of the crime and the Queen is ready to have her head chopped off, but the King says she needs a trial. In the meantime, the Queen orders Alice to be taken to prison by the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who introduces her to the [[Mock Turtle]].
