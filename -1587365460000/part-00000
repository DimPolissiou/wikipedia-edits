Goodyear refused to serve the penalty, claiming that the green light was on, and stayed out on the track. Officials disqualified him on lap 195 effectively making him classified 5 laps down, which handed [[Jacques Villeneuve]] the lead of the race, and ultimately, a controversial victory.<ref name=\"Remembering 1995\" /> Examination of video evidence after the race proved that Goodyear passed the pace car while the yellow light was on,<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\">{{cite AV media|type=TV broadcast|title=1995 Miller Genuine Draft 200 |publisher=[[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]|date=1995-06-04}}</ref> and his team declined to protest the ruling.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> Villeneuve's winning car was powered by the [[Cosworth|Ford Cosworth XB]] engine, the powerplant's first Indy victory in its fourth attempt. The win broke a seven-year winning streak by [[Ilmor]]-constructed engines. With Goodyear's disqualification, [[Honda]] was effectively denied their first Indy victory, and would not manage to win at Indianapolis until [[2004 Indianapolis 500|2004]].\n\nRace winner Jacques Villeneuve's day was not without incident, as he was penalized two laps for inadvertently passing the pace car during a caution period in the early segment of the race. Through both strategy and luck, the young driver made up the deficit during the course of the race, earning the \"Indy 505\" sobriquet. In addition to the race controversies, the day was marred by a multi-car crash on the opening lap involving [[Stan Fox]], [[Eddie Cheever]], and others. Fox suffered career-ending [[Closed head injury|head injuries]].\n\nThe race was held under a growing cloud of uncertainty about the future of the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]]. Since the early 1980s, the sport had operated in relative harmony, with an arrangement such that [[Champ Car|CART]] sanctioned the season-long Indycar national championship, and [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] sanctioned the Indy 500 singly. The Speedway's management, led by [[Tony George]], had already announced the formation of the rival [[Indy Racing League]] for 1996, and the Indy 500 was to be its centerpiece. Competitors, fans, and media alike, were apprehensive about the event's future beyond 1995. It ultimately would be the final Indy 500 which featured a field of [[Champ Car|CART]]-based drivers and teams.<ref name=\"Remembering 1995\">{{cite news |url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20080525/SPORTS0107/805250347/Remembering-1995-Indy-500|title=Remembering the 1995 Indy 500|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|first=Matt|last=Baker|date=2008-05-24|accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref>\n\nDue to injuries, retirements, and the open wheel split months later, the race was the final Indy 500 for several drivers, including [[Bobby Rahal]],<ref name=\"Remembering 1995\" /> [[Danny Sullivan]] (career ending injury in Michigan in 1995), [[Teo Fabi]], [[Scott Pruett]], and [[Stefan Johansson]].

Fearing an unfair advantage, and the possibility of escalating costs, both [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] and [[Champ Car|CART]] separately evaluated the situation. Two weeks after the 1994 race, USAC announced that for 1995, the 209 cid purpose-built pushrod engines would be allowed 52 [[Inch of mercury|inHG]] of \"boost\" (down from 55 [[Inch of mercury|inHG]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-895954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103065453/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-895954.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-03|title=Auto Racing|work=The Washington Post|date=1994-06-14|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref> The traditional \"stock block\" production-based engines (e.g., [[Buick]] & [[Team Menard|Menard]]) would still be allowed 55 [[Inch of mercury|inHG]].

Despite the outward appearance that the team was still at the top of their game entering Indianapolis, insiders at the team were growing apprehensive, and were concerned that they were ill-prepared. A private test yielded poor results related to the chassis handling, and it was becoming increasingly apparent that the team had lost considerable ground after losing the use of the Mercedes-Benz 500I.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> However, a test in mid-April yielded speeds of 228&nbsp;mph, which would have been enough to make the race, though not put either car on the front row.\n\nOther changes for 1995 included the heralded return of [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires, which had last competed in 1974, and an updated [[Honda]] V-8 engine.\n\n===Team and driver changes===\n[[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|Rahal-Hogan Racing]] dropped the Honda program, and instead, [[Tasman Motorsports]] became the prominent team involved.<ref name=\"NYT-Parity\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/sports/at-indy-500-parity-forges-way-into-driver-s-seat.html?pagewanted=1 |title=At Indy 500, Parity Forges Way Into Driver's Seat |work=New York Times |date=1995-05-28 |first=Joseph |last=Siano |accessdate=15 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Honda introduced a new engine for the 1995 race, the aluminum alloy block HRH V-8, replacing the older iron block HRX V-8.

The fastest non-qualified car was [[\u00c9ric Bachelart]] at 227.261&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt Team Penske, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] wheeled out a year-old Penske chassis and practiced for 59 laps, with a top lap of 220.745&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Tuesday May 16===\nRain kept the track closed until 2:11&nbsp;p.m. Team Penske borrowed a Reynard chassis from [[Roberto Guerrero]]'s team, and [[Al Unser, Jr.]] took his first laps in the car. In 44 laps, Unser posted a top lap of 218.050&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt 4:45&nbsp;p.m., [[Bryan Herta]] spun and crashed hard in turn 2. The car became slightly airborne, and Herta momentarily lost consciousness. Herta was diagnosed with a minor concussion, and was sidelined for several days.\n\n[[Teo Fabi]] (226.998&nbsp;mph) posted the fastest lap of the day.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Wednesday May 17===\nRain closed the track for the day.\n\nOff the track, [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal-Hogan Racing]] announced that they would supply [[Penske Racing|Marlboro Team Penske]] with back-up [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis, in a goodwill effort to help Penske's drivers get up to speed. A year earlier, Penske had loaned chassis to Rahal's team, when they were struggling to qualify the 1994 Honda-powered machines.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Thursday May 18===\nDriving the newly acquired [[Lola Cars|Lola]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] was quickly up to 223.775&nbsp;mph. [[Al Unser, Jr.]], however, remained in the Penske chassis, and was mired back at only 218.510&nbsp;mph.\n\nThe practice session was brief, as rain kept the track closed until 2 p.m. Green flag conditions only lasted 53 minutes, and the track closed for rain at 3:21&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Friday May 19===\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy action. [[Adrian Fernandez]] (228.397&nbsp;mph) led the speed chart for the non-qualified cars. The attention of the afternoon was focused again on Team Penske, as they were making their final efforts to get their cars up to speed.\n\n[[Emerson Fittipaldi]] driving the [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] back-up car, quickly began to find speed, and within 10 minutes, was over 226&nbsp;mph. At 11:26&nbsp;a.m., Fittipaldi turned a lap of 227.814&nbsp;mph, his fastest lap of the month, and the fastest lap by that car all month.\n\n[[Al Unser, Jr.]], however, was still trying to salvage speed out of the Penske car. After several inconsistent times throughout the day, his best lap of 219.085&nbsp;mph was completed with five minutes left in the session. That night, [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] offered a second chassis to Penske for Unser, Jr. to drive.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n==Time trials \u2013 weekend 2==\n\n===Third Day \u2013 Saturday May 20===\nAt 5 p.m., [[Al Unser, Jr.]] made his first attempt to qualify in a [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] back-up car. Unser had practiced just minutes earlier at over 227&nbsp;mph. After two laps in the 224&nbsp;mph range, the run was waved off.\n\n[[Scott Sharp]], in a Foyt backup also waved off his first attempt. At 5:14&nbsp;p.m., [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] made his first attempt in a [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] backup car. His third lap was up to 226.097&nbsp;mph, but the crew waved off the run. The move angered Fittipaldi, and proved unwise, as the speed would have been fast enough to qualify.\n\nMost cars failed to complete their attempts, as conditions were unfavorable for speeds. [[Al Unser, Jr.]] returned to the track for his second attempt at 5:46&nbsp;p.m. This run, however, slower, and even more inconsistent, and the team waved it off as well.\n\n[[Franck Fr\u00e9on]] completed a slow run of 224.432&nbsp;mph, and tentatively placed himself as slowest in the field. [[Scott Sharp]] made one last attempt as time expired, but the crew again waved off the run.\n\nThe day ended with the field filled to 30 cars. Both [[Penske Racing|Penske]] cars, along with Sharp, were still not qualified.\n\n===Bump Day \u2013 Sunday May 21===\nWith only three positions remaining, bump day began with both Penske drivers struggling to get their cars up to speed. At noon, [[Carlos Guerrero]] completed a run of 225.831&nbsp;mph, and filled the field to 31 cars. [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] waved off a run, and the early qualifiers were through.\n\nOver the next four hours, the Penske team practiced, in a futile search for speed. Fittipaldi completed one lap at 228.017&nbsp;mph, while Unser, Jr. managed only 222.206 all afternoon.\n\nAt 5:07&nbsp;p.m., qualifying resumed. [[Scott Sharp]] completed a run of 225.711&nbsp;mph, slightly faster than his waved off run a day before. With only one position open, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] took to the track. It was his second attempt to qualify. His four-lap run of 224.907&nbsp;mph put him 32nd-fastest, and filled the field to 33 cars. Minutes later, [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] completed a run of 225.135&nbsp;mph, and bumped out [[Franck Fr\u00e9on]]. The move put Fittipaldi on the bubble.\n\nAfter surviving two attempts, Fittipaldi still clung to the 33rd starting position at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. His teammate [[Al Unser, Jr.]] then took to the track in his third and final attempt. He faced the grim possibility of missing the field, or bumping out his teammate to make the field. Unser's first lap of 221.992&nbsp;mph drastically pulled down his average, and his speed was too slow to bump out Fittipaldi.\n\nFittipaldi survived three more attempts, and with 12 minutes left in the day, [[Stefan Johansson]] took to the track. Johannsson's speed of 225.547&nbsp;mph bumped out Fittipaldi.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The Penske team had three cars left in the qualifying line, but none had a realistic chance of bumping their way in, or even making it to the front of the line. As the 6 o'clock gun sounded, Fittipaldi and Unser, Jr., the winners of the previous three Indy 500s, were out of time, and had failed to qualify. It was the first time since 1968 that Penske Racing had failed to qualify a single car in the Indianapolis 500. \n\nPost-race Roger Penske quoted, ''\"I've got to take the responsibility for not getting into the race, but a lot of my fellow team owners came up to me and offered me help and I want to thank them for that from the bottom of my heart. We are not going to buy our way into this race. We had an opportunity to compete on a level playing field and we did not get the job done.\"''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/05/21/Penske-fails-to-qualify-for-Indy-500/2413801028800/|title=Penske fails to qualify for Indy 500|last=Martin|first=Bruce|date=May 21, 1995|access-date=August 26, 2019|agency=[[United Press International]]}}</ref>\n\n==Starting Grid==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!Row\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Inside\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Middle\n!colspan=2 width=\"195\"|Outside\n|-\n!1\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''60''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Brayton]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''40''' \n|{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Arie Luyendyk]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''24''' \n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Scott Goodyear]]\n|-\n!2\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''6''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Michael Andretti]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''27''' \n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Jacques Villeneuve]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''18''' \n|{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]]\n|-\n!3\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''5''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Robby Gordon]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''20''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Pruett]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''12''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jimmy Vasser]]\n|-\n!4\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''25''' \n|{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Hiro Matsushita]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''91''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Stan Fox]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''31''' \n|{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|-\n!5\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''21''' \n|{{flagicon|COL}} [[Roberto Guerrero]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''14''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Eddie Cheever]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''33''' \n|{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Teo Fabi]]\n|-\n!6\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''3''' \n|{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Paul Tracy]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''34''' \n|{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Alessandro Zampedri]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''17''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Danny Sullivan]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|-\n!7\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''8''' \n|{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Gil de Ferran]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''54''' \n|{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Hideshi Matsuda]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''9''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bobby Rahal]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|-\n!8\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''11''' \n|{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Raul Boesel]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''80''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Lazier]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''7''' \n|{{flagicon|CHI}} [[Eliseo Salazar]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|-\n!9\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''10''' \n|{{flagicon|MEX}} [[Adrian Fern\u00e1ndez]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''19''' \n|{{flagicon|BEL}} [[\u00c9ric Bachelart]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''15''' \n|{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Christian Fittipaldi]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|-\n!10\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''90''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lyn St. James]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''22''' \n|{{flagicon|MEX}} [[Carlos Guerrero]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''41''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Sharp]]\n|-\n!11\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''16''' \n|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Stefan Johansson]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''77''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20\"| '''4''' \n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bryan Herta]]\n|}\n\n*Note: [[Bryan Herta]] crashed his already-qualified primary car during practice.

The rain stopped, however, and the track was dried. The start of the race was delayed by only about five minutes.\n\nAt the start, [[Scott Goodyear]] swept into the lead from the outside of the front row. Seconds later, [[Stan Fox]] dipped low to the inside, hit the rumble strips, became loose and spun a half turn. The car shot directly into the outside wall in turn one.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> The car was demolished, the front nose was ripped off, and Fox's legs and body were exposed as the car crashed up into the catch fence.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> [[Eddie Cheever]], [[Lyn St. James]], and [[Carlos Guerrero]] were caught up in the accident. [[Gil de Ferran]] ran over a piece of debris, breaking the front suspension. He limped back to the pits, but dropped out when it was determined the damage was too much to repair. A long caution was needed for cleanup, and Fox was critically injured with a [[closed head injury]] due to [[g-force]]s. Despite his exposed [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]], however, he suffered no major injuries to his arms or legs. Fox was transported to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]], and after several months, he recovered, but would never race again.\n\nOn lap 10, the race finally got restarted. [[Arie Luyendyk]] got the jump on the green flag, and took the lead.\n\n===Jacques Villeneuve penalty===\nOn lap 37, [[Arie Luyendyk]] was trying to get by the car of [[Scott Sharp]]. Luyendyk felt that Sharp was blocking him, and as they went into turn 1, Luyendyk gave him [[the finger]]. In the process, he knocked off his helmet headrest cushion. It flew out of the cockpit and landed on the racing surface. It brought out the yellow flag for debris. The yellow came out during a sequence of green-flag pit stops, the field was hectically shuffling in and out of the pit area.\n\nBy rule, the pits were immediately closed at the onset of yellow, and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] became scored as the leader on lap 38. A few cars, including Villeneuve, [[Scott Pruett]] and others, had not made their scheduled pit stop yet, and were getting precariously close to running out of fuel. Villeneuve was not aware he was actually leading the pack. The pace car came out to pick up the field, and by rule, was supposed to get directly in front of Villeneuve as the leader. But Villeneuve went by the pace car twice, not knowing they were trying to pick him up. Finally, the officials sorted out the field, the pit area was opened, and Villeneuve immediately went to the pits for service. He suffered a slow stop with several errors. He nearly pulled away with the fuel hose attached, then subsequently stalled as he pulled away.\n\nA few minutes after the race went back to green, [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] assessed [[Jacques Villeneuve]] a two-lap penalty for passing the pace car twice as they were trying to pick him up. The penalty dropped him from 3rd place to 27th. The two laps were effectively deleted from his scoring serial.\n\n===First half===\n[[Michael Andretti]] led 45 laps in the first half but on lap 77, he was abruptly knocked out of the race. [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] was leading in turn four, and [[Michael Andretti|Andretti]] was behind him in second place. Andretti caught him in turn four, as [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin|Gugelmin]] was slowing down to make a pit stop. Andretti tried to go around him on the outside, but got up into the \"marbles\" and brushed the wall exiting turn four, damaging the suspension. He veered across the track to enter the pits, to have the crew look over the car. The rear wishbone suspension was bent, and [[Michael Andretti|Andretti]] climbed out of the car, out of the race.\n\nAs Andretti was climbing from his car, [[Scott Sharp]] spun and wrecked in turn four.\n\nBy the time the field went back to green on lap 84, [[Jacques Villeneuve]] had made up one of his laps. He was running 20th, one lap down.\n\n===Second half===\nOn lap 124, [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andre Ribeiro]] stalled on the track with an electrical problem. By that time, [[Jacques Villeneuve]] had gotten his lap back, and was now on the lead lap in 12th place. Villeneuve caught another break when [[Paul Tracy]] slowed on the backstretch with electrical problems, bringing out another caution. \n\n[[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] led the most laps (59) but did not manage to lead again after lap 138. The leaders were now [[Jimmy Vasser]], [[Scott Pruett]], and [[Scott Goodyear]]. [[Jacques Villeneuve]] was now up to 6th place. After Vasser pitted while leading on lap 157, Villeneuve retook the lead for the first time since his penalty. \n\nOn lap 162, [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] crashed in turn 2 as Villeneuve was preparing to pit. The race restarted on lap 169. Vasser led following pit stops by most of the drivers during the caution. A lap later, [[Scott Pruett]] passed him going down the backstretch for the lead. Vasser got high and hit the outside wall in the north chute. Pruett held point until shortly after the restart on lap 176 when Goodyear passed him. \n\nBy this stage of the race, the winds began to gust over 30 mph. On lap 184, with Goodyear still in front by almost a second, Pruett got high in turn 2 and bounced off the outside wall. Pruett\u2019s car spun across the backstretch, got airborne and backed into the catchfence, demolishing the rear end.\n\n===Finish===\nWith eleven laps to go, [[Scott Goodyear]] led [[Jacques Villeneuve]], [[Eliseo Salazar]] and [[Christian Fittipaldi]] under caution. The field prepared to go back to green on lap 190. Down the backstretch, Goodyear held back a little bit and allowed the pace car to clear ahead. [[United States Auto Club]] (USAC) official Don Bailey was driving the Corvette pace car, which was entering turn four. At the entrance of turn three, Goodyear and Villeneuve both accelerated, leaving a trail of tire marks behind. Villeneuve was right on his tail. Entering turn four, Goodyear continued to accelerate, but Villeneuve suddenly backed off to avoid passing the pace car. The two cars had caught up to the pace car in the middle of turn four, and it had not yet entered the pits. Scott Goodyear did not lift, blew by the pace car and proceeded to race down the front stretch. The rest of the field checked up and a gaggle of six cars nearly collided to avoid the pace car as it pulled into the pits.\n\nUSAC flagman Duane Sweeney put out the green flag, with Goodyear now well ahead of the rest of the cars. Villeneuve emerged from the incident still in second, and the rest of the field diced down the front stretch and funneled into turn one without incident.\n\nA few moments later, USAC race control announced that Scott Goodyear was being assessed a stop-and-go penalty for passing the pace car on the restart. Goodyear was in disbelief on his radio, insisting that he did not do anything wrong. He claimed that the green light was on, and many felt the pace car was going too slow. The black-flag was waved at Goodyear but he kept racing and chose not to acknowledge it. Goodyear's boss/team owner Steve Horne told Goodyear to keep going to the end believing they could protest the penalty eventually.\n\nSince he failed to heed the penalty, USAC ceased scoring Goodyear after lap 195. Therefore, when Jacques Villeneuve came around to complete 196 laps he was scored officially in the lead, with Christian Fittipaldi second and [[Bobby Rahal]] now third. Villeneuve led the rest of the way to win the race. On the last lap, [[Arie Luyendyk]] passed Villeneuve at the stripe to un-lap himself, and finished 7th on the lead lap. With his lap total stopped at 195 for ignoring the penalty, Goodyear sank through the standings to 15th place, 5 laps down.\n\nPole-sitter [[Scott Brayton]]'s day ended ten laps down in 17th place. His car was down on turbocharger boost, and after the race he quipped that he was so slow he felt he \"was in the way.\" Years later, it would be revealed that Brayton (and his teammate [[Arie Luyendyk]]), were secretly being penalized by USAC for illegally over-boosting their turbocharger plenums and tampering with the pop-off valves during practice and qualifying.<ref name=\"1995Rough\">{{cite news|url=http://8w.forix.com/indy95.html|title=The 1995 Indianapolis 500 controversy: Rough justice, but justice nonetheless|publisher=8W|first=Henri|last=Greuter|date=2012-01-11|accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trackforum.com/forums/showthread.php?36541-straight-line-speeds-at-indy&p=465754&viewfull=1#post465754|title=1995 menard boost|publisher=TrackForum.com|date=2004-01-02|accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref>\n\nScott Goodyear was visibly upset in an interview as he said to reporters: ''\"Disbelief is the best word to describe how I feel. I feel like I won this race. The pace-car was going too slow. ... I almost hit it. Scott Pruett almost hit it, Villeneuve almost hit it. He wasn't on the gas and I saw the green lights turn on and that meant go. That's all I can say. I stayed out because in my eyes it was perfect ... and if I came in and later found I didn't make a mistake then what are you going to do? It would have been too late and you won't get it back.\"''\n\n===Aftermath and legacy===\nThe finish was highly controversial, with [[Scott Goodyear]] passing the pace car emerging as the story of the race. [[Scott Goodyear|Goodyear]] claimed that he saw the green light on when he blew by the pace car, and the team threatened to protest. Video footage, however, was found that showed the yellow light was still on when it happened.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" />\n\nIn addition, scoring transponders in the pace car and the race cars showed the following:<ref>USAC Timing and Scoring Data \u2013 1995 Indianapolis 500</ref>\n*At the end of the backstretch, the pace car, turning its lights off, was clocked at 77&nbsp;mph. Goodyear was slightly slower at 68&nbsp;mph.\n*At the entry of turn three, where the pace car had been clocked at 83&nbsp;mph, Goodyear and Villeneuve flew by at 117&nbsp;mph and 118&nbsp;mph respectively.\n*Through the north chute, Goodyear increased his speed to about 166&nbsp;mph. The pace car was in the middle of turn 4.\n*By the exit of turn four, Goodyear blew by the pace car going about 193&nbsp;mph. The pace car was speeding up from about 98&nbsp;mph to over 117&nbsp;mph as it entered the pits. Villeneuve, anticipating the situation, quickly slowed back down to about 142&nbsp;mph.\n\nAfter video and timing and scoring evidence came out that was not supportive of Goodyear's case, the team ([[Tasman Motorsports]]) decided not to file a protest.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> Goodyear stated that he stayed out (and did not serve the stop-and-go penalty) because if he was in the right, and stayed out, he could still be scored as the winner. If he came in, he would have lost the theoretical lead, and would have had no chance of claiming victory.\n\nLargely overlooked was [[Bobby Rahal]]'s charge from 21st starting position to 3rd \u2013 the second year in a row he greatly improved on his starting position (in 1994, he started 28th and finished 3rd). It was also the first time in an odd year that Rahal finished the race. From 1982\u20131994, Rahal had a notable \"odd-even/good-bad\" streak at Indy. In even years, he had good finishes, and in odd years, his results were poor. Rahal's result was also accomplished in spite of a pit lane speeding penalty assessed during the race, a penalty that Rahal disputed in his post race television interview, as his car's on board speedometer had said that he was traveling 91&nbsp;mph, safely under the 100&nbsp;mph speed limit; Rahal called the penalty 'balderdash'. This would end up being his final Indy 500 as a driver. He returned to Indy seven years later as an owner in 2002.\n\n[[Arie Luyendyk|Arie Luyendyk's]] pass of [[Jacques Villeneuve]] at the start-finish line was noteworthy as it allowed him to complete the full 500 miles, becoming the second and final driver to complete 500 miles in a [[Buick]]/[[Team Menard|Menard]] powered car.  Luyendyk's 7th-place finish was the second-highest for the Buick/Menard V6, surpassed only by the third-place finish of [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]] in [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]].\n\n[[Jacques Villeneuve]] went on to win the [[1995 IndyCar season|1995 CART championship]], and subsequently signed with [[Williams F1|Williams]] in the offseason. With a growing cloud of controversy and uncertainty over a potential and looming open wheel \"split,\" the 1995 Indianapolis 500 marked a turning point in the sport. Within months, and by the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 race]], the landscape and organizational harmony of Indy car racing would change drastically. Villeneuve is the first, and so far, as of 2019, the only Canadian person to win the Indy 500.\n\n[[Al Unser, Jr.]], who notably failed to qualify, would like others, not be able to return to the 500 for several years, due mostly to the upcoming open wheel \"split.\" The devastating result helped exacerbate an existing downward spiral that was involving his personal life.<ref name=\"ABC news 5-25\">{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=4507309&page=1#.T2oM_XlLqzk|title=Al Unser Jr. Is Putting the Brakes on Alcoholism|work=[[ABC News]]|first=Alan|last=Mozes|date=2007-05-25|accessdate=2012-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"morning call 5-22-03\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2003-05-22/sports/3470436_1_rock-bottom-drink-or-two-al-coholic|title=Al Unser Jr.lives day-to-day as an alcoholic|work=[[The Morning Call]]|first=Paul|last=Reinhard|date=2003-05-22|accessdate=2012-03-21}}</ref> Unser, Jr. returned to the Speedway for the first time in August of [[IROC XXII|1998]], and competed in the inaugural [[IROC at Indy]], finishing a close second to [[Mark Martin]].

Goodyear refused to serve the penalty, claiming that the green light was on, and stayed out on the track. Officials disqualified him on lap 195 effectively making him classified 5 laps down, which handed [[Jacques Villeneuve]] the lead of the race, and ultimately, a controversial victory.<ref name=\"Remembering 1995\" /> Examination of video evidence after the race proved that Goodyear passed the pace car while the yellow light was on,<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\">{{cite AV media|type=TV broadcast|title=1995 Miller Genuine Draft 200 |publisher=[[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]|airdate=1995-06-04}}</ref> and his team declined to protest the ruling.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> Villeneuve's winning car was powered by the [[Cosworth|Ford Cosworth XB]] engine, the powerplant's first Indy victory in its fourth attempt. The win broke a seven-year winning streak by [[Ilmor]]-constructed engines. With Goodyear's disqualification, [[Honda]] was effectively denied their first Indy victory, and would not manage to win at Indianapolis until [[2004 Indianapolis 500|2004]].\n\nRace winner Jacques Villeneuve's day was not without incident, as he was penalized two laps for inadvertently passing the pace car during a caution period in the early segment of the race. Through both strategy and luck, the young driver made up the deficit during the course of the race, earning the \"Indy 505\" sobriquet. In addition to the race controversies, the day was marred by a multi-car crash on the opening lap involving [[Stan Fox]], [[Eddie Cheever]], and others. Fox suffered career-ending [[Closed head injury|head injuries]].\n\nThe race was held under a growing cloud of uncertainty about the future of the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]]. Since the early 1980s, the sport had operated in relative harmony, with an arrangement such that [[Champ Car|CART]] sanctioned the season-long Indycar national championship, and [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] sanctioned the Indy 500 singly. The Speedway's management, led by [[Tony George]], had already announced the formation of the rival [[Indy Racing League]] for 1996, and the Indy 500 was to be its centerpiece.

Fearing an unfair advantage, and the possibility of escalating costs, both [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] and [[Champ Car|CART]] separately evaluated the situation. Two weeks after the 1994 race, USAC announced that for 1995, the 209 cid purpose-built pushrod engines would be allowed 52 [[Inch of mercury|inHG]] of \"boost\" (down from 55 [[Inch of mercury|inHG]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-895954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103065453/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-895954.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-03|title=Auto Racing|work=The Washington Post|date=1994-06-14|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref> The traditional \"stock block\" production-based engines (e.g., [[Buick]] & [[Team Menard|Menard]]) would still be allowed 55 [[Inch of mercury|inHG]].

On August 11, 1994, USAC changed its decision, and scaled back the boost for the purpose-built pushrod engines further to 48&nbsp;inches; and outlawing it outright for [[1996 Indy Racing League season|1996]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=708&FS=INDYCAR|title=Indy Racing League announces engine specs|publisher=Motorsport.com|date=1994-08-11|accessdate=2009-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608002355/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=708&FS=INDYCAR|archive-date=2011-06-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> The move was considered by [[Roger Penske]] as \"politically motivated,\" and ultimately set back the [[Penske Racing|Penske Team]] going into 1995.\n\nMarlboro Team Penske won 12 (of 16) races in 1994, including five 1-2-3 finishes, and swept the top 3 in the final 1994 CART championship points standings. As the 1995 season started, Penske drivers [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi|Fittipaldi]] each won a race prior to Indy. Despite the outward appearance that the team was still at the top of their game entering Indianapolis, insiders at the team were growing apprehensive, and were concerned that they were ill-prepared. A private test yielded poor results related to the chassis handling, and it was becoming increasingly apparent that the team had lost considerable ground after losing the use of the Mercedes-Benz 500I.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> However, a test in mid-April yielded speeds of 228&nbsp;mph, which would have been enough to make the race, though not put either car on the front row.\n\nOther changes for 1995 included the heralded return of [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires, which had last competed in 1974, and an updated [[Honda]] V-8 engine.\n\n===Team and driver changes===\n[[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|Rahal-Hogan Racing]] dropped the Honda program, and instead, [[Tasman Motorsports]] became the prominent team involved.<ref name=\"NYT-Parity\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/sports/at-indy-500-parity-forges-way-into-driver-s-seat.html?pagewanted=1 |title=At Indy 500, Parity Forges Way Into Driver's Seat |work=New York Times |date=1995-05-28 |first=Joseph |last=Siano |accessdate=15 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Honda introduced a new engine for the 1995 race, the aluminum alloy block HRH V-8, replacing the older iron block HRX V-8.

Penske drivers [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and defending Indy 500 winner [[Al Unser, Jr.]] took their first practice laps of the month, but neither were among the top ten.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Monday May 8===\n[[Arie Luyendyk]] posted the fastest practice lap in Indy history, 234.107&nbsp;mph.

The brief practice session was ended around 4 p.m. due to rain.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Thursday May 11===\n[[Arie Luyendyk]] upped the fastest practice lap in Indy history to 234.322&nbsp;mph. Scott Brayton later bettered the time with a lap of 234.656&nbsp;mph. Eight drivers were over 230&nbsp;mph for the day.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Friday, May 12===\nAt 5:12&nbsp;p.m., [[Jacques Villeneuve]] went high in turn 2 and crashed into the outside wall. The car was heavily damaged, but Villeneuve was not seriously injured.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n[[Arie Luyendyk]] set yet another unofficial track record, with a practice lap of 234.913&nbsp;mph. The top nine drivers were all over 231&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n==Time trials \u2013 weekend 1==\n\n===Pole day \u2013 Saturday May 13===\nRain delayed the start of time trials until late in the afternoon. At 4:45&nbsp;p.m., pole day qualifying began. [[Arie Luyendyk]] in a [[Team Menard|Menard]] entry, took the provisional pole at 231.031&nbsp;mph. A tight schedule saw several cars take runs, including [[Eddie Cheever]] (226.314&nbsp;mph) and [[Paul Tracy]] (225.795&nbsp;mph)\n\nAt 5:16&nbsp;p.m., [[Scott Brayton]], also driving for Menard, secured the pole position with a run of 231.604&nbsp;mph. Before the close of the day, [[Michael Andretti]] (229.294&nbsp;mph) tentatively squeezed his way onto the front row.\n\nWhen the 6 o'clock gun sounded, 11 cars were in the field, and several drivers were still in the qualifying line. Pole day qualifying would be extended into the next day.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Second day \u2013 Sunday May 14===\nA windy but warm day was observed for the second day of time trials. Pole qualifying continued from the previous day. Several cars qualified, with [[Jacques Villeneuve]] leading the early cars at 228.397&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt 1:07&nbsp;p.m., [[Scott Goodyear]] (230.759&nbsp;mph) qualified his Honda-powered machine for the third starting position, bumping Michael Andretti to the second row. At 1:12&nbsp;p.m., the original pole day qualifying order was exhausted, and [[Scott Brayton]] was officially awarded the pole position. Among the cars who had not qualified included [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal-Hogan]] drivers [[Bobby Rahal]] & [[Raul Boesel]]. Neither [[Penske Racing|Penske]] entry ([[Emerson Fittipaldi]] & [[Al Unser, Jr.]]) made an attempt in the pole round.\n\nSecond day qualifying started at just before 1:30&nbsp;p.m. Among the quicker runs were [[Hideshi Matsuda]], [[Bobby Rahal]] and [[Raul Boesel]]. [[Buddy Lazier]] joined the two previous Menard entries and put a third team car in the field. At the close of the second day of time trials, the field was filled to 25 cars (8 vacant). After continuing problems getting up to speed, neither Penske entry attempted to qualify all weekend.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n==Practice \u2013 week 2==\n\n===Monday May 15===\nTeam Menard cars took their first day off since the Speedway opened for the month. [[Paul Tracy]] (228.339&nbsp;mph) led the speed chart for the day. The fastest non-qualified car was [[\u00c9ric Bachelart]] at 227.261&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt Team Penske, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] wheeled out a year-old Penske chassis and practiced for 59 laps, with a top lap of 220.745&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Tuesday May 16===\nRain kept the track closed until 2:11&nbsp;p.m. Team Penske borrowed a Reynard chassis from [[Roberto Guerrero]]'s team, and [[Al Unser, Jr.]] took his first laps in the car. In 44 laps, Unser posted a top lap of 218.050&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt 4:45&nbsp;p.m., [[Bryan Herta]] spun and crashed hard in turn 2. The car became slightly airborne, and Herta momentarily lost consciousness. Herta was diagnosed with a minor concussion, and was sidelined for several days.\n\n[[Teo Fabi]] (226.998&nbsp;mph) posted the fastest lap of the day.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Wednesday May 17===\nRain closed the track for the day.\n\nOff the track, [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal-Hogan Racing]] announced that they would supply [[Penske Racing|Marlboro Team Penske]] with back-up [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis, in a goodwill effort to help Penske's drivers get up to speed. A year earlier, Penske had loaned chassis to Rahal's team, when they were struggling to qualify the 1994 Honda-powered machines.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Thursday May 18===\nDriving the newly acquired [[Lola Cars|Lola]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] was quickly up to 223.775&nbsp;mph. [[Al Unser, Jr.]], however, remained in the Penske chassis, and was mired back at only 218.510&nbsp;mph.\n\nThe practice session was brief, as rain kept the track closed until 2 p.m. Green flag conditions only lasted 53 minutes, and the track closed for rain at 3:21&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n===Friday May 19===\nThe final full day of practice saw heavy action. [[Adrian Fernandez]] (228.397&nbsp;mph) led the speed chart for the non-qualified cars. The attention of the afternoon was focused again on Team Penske, as they were making their final efforts to get their cars up to speed.\n\n[[Emerson Fittipaldi]] driving the [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] back-up car, quickly began to find speed, and within 10 minutes, was over 226&nbsp;mph. At 11:26&nbsp;a.m., Fittipaldi turned a lap of 227.814&nbsp;mph, his fastest lap of the month, and the fastest lap by that car all month.\n\n[[Al Unser, Jr.]], however, was still trying to salvage speed out of the Penske car. After several inconsistent times throughout the day, his best lap of 219.085&nbsp;mph was completed with five minutes left in the session. That night, [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] offered a second chassis to Penske for Unser, Jr. to drive.<ref name=\"1995 DTR\" />\n\n==Time trials \u2013 weekend 2==\n\n===Third Day \u2013 Saturday May 20===\nAt 5 p.m., [[Al Unser, Jr.]] made his first attempt to qualify in a [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] back-up car. Unser had practiced just minutes earlier at over 227&nbsp;mph. After two laps in the 224&nbsp;mph range, the run was waved off.\n\n[[Scott Sharp]], in a Foyt backup also waved off his first attempt. At 5:14&nbsp;p.m., [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] made his first attempt in a [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] backup car. His third lap was up to 226.097&nbsp;mph, but the crew waved off the run. The move angered Fittipaldi, and proved unwise, as the speed would have been fast enough to qualify.\n\nMost cars failed to complete their attempts, as conditions were unfavorable for speeds. [[Al Unser, Jr.]] returned to the track for his second attempt at 5:46&nbsp;p.m. This run, however, slower, and even more inconsistent, and the team waved it off as well.\n\n[[Franck Fr\u00e9on]] completed a slow run of 224.432&nbsp;mph, and tentatively placed himself as slowest in the field. [[Scott Sharp]] made one last attempt as time expired, but the crew again waved off the run.\n\nThe day ended with the field filled to 30 cars. Both [[Penske Racing|Penske]] cars, along with Sharp, were still not qualified.\n\n===Bump Day \u2013 Sunday May 21===\nWith only three positions remaining, bump day began with both Penske drivers struggling to get their cars up to speed. At noon, [[Carlos Guerrero]] completed a run of 225.831&nbsp;mph, and filled the field to 31 cars. [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] waved off a run, and the early qualifiers were through.\n\nOver the next four hours, the Penske team practiced, in a futile search for speed. Fittipaldi completed one lap at 228.017&nbsp;mph, while Unser, Jr. managed only 222.206 all afternoon.\n\nAt 5:07&nbsp;p.m., qualifying resumed. [[Scott Sharp]] completed a run of 225.711&nbsp;mph, slightly faster than his waved off run a day before. With only one position open, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] took to the track. It was his second attempt to qualify. His four-lap run of 224.907&nbsp;mph put him 32nd-fastest, and filled the field to 33 cars. Minutes later, [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] completed a run of 225.135&nbsp;mph, and bumped out [[Franck Fr\u00e9on]]. The move put Fittipaldi on the bubble.\n\nAfter surviving two attempts, Fittipaldi still clung to the 33rd starting position at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. His teammate [[Al Unser, Jr.]] then took to the track in his third and final attempt. He faced the grim possibility of missing the field, or bumping out his teammate to make the field. Unser's first lap of 221.992&nbsp;mph drastically pulled down his average, and his speed was too slow to bump out Fittipaldi.\n\nFittipaldi survived three more attempts, and with 12 minutes left in the day, [[Stefan Johansson]] took to the track. Johannsson's speed of 225.547&nbsp;mph bumped out Fittipaldi.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The Penske team had three cars left in the qualifying line, but none had a realistic chance of bumping their way in, or even making it to the front of the line. As the 6 o'clock gun sounded, Fittipaldi and Unser, Jr., the winners of the previous three Indy 500s, were out of time, and had failed to qualify. It was the first time since 1968 that Penske Racing had failed to qualify a single car in the Indianapolis 500. \n\nPost-race Roger Penske quoted, ''\"I've got to take the responsibility for not getting into the race, but a lot of my fellow team owners came up to me and offered me help and I want to thank them for that from the bottom of my heart.

The rain stopped, however, and the track was dried. The start of the race was delayed by only about five minutes.\n\nAt the start, [[Scott Goodyear]] swept into the lead from the outside of the front row. Seconds later, [[Stan Fox]] dipped low to the inside, hit the rumble strips, became loose and spun a half turn. The car shot directly into the outside wall in turn one.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> The car was demolished, the front nose was ripped off, and Fox's legs and body were exposed as the car crashed up into the catch fence.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> [[Eddie Cheever]], [[Lyn St. James]], and [[Carlos Guerrero]] were caught up in the accident. [[Gil de Ferran]] ran over a piece of debris, breaking the front suspension. He limped back to the pits, but dropped out when it was determined the damage was too much to repair. A long caution was needed for cleanup, and Fox was critically injured with a [[closed head injury]] due to [[g-force]]s. Despite his exposed [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]], however, he suffered no major injuries to his arms or legs. Fox was transported to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]], and after several months, he recovered, but would never race again.\n\nOn lap 10, the race finally got restarted. [[Arie Luyendyk]] got the jump on the green flag, and took the lead.\n\n===Jacques Villeneuve penalty===\nOn lap 37, [[Arie Luyendyk]] was trying to get by the car of [[Scott Sharp]]. Luyendyk felt that Sharp was blocking him, and as they went into turn 1, Luyendyk gave him [[the finger]]. In the process, he knocked off his helmet headrest cushion. It flew out of the cockpit and landed on the racing surface. It brought out the yellow flag for debris. The yellow came out during a sequence of green-flag pit stops, the field was hectically shuffling in and out of the pit area.\n\nBy rule, the pits were immediately closed at the onset of yellow, and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] became scored as the leader on lap 38. A few cars, including Villeneuve, [[Scott Pruett]] and others, had not made their scheduled pit stop yet, and were getting precariously close to running out of fuel. Villeneuve was not aware he was actually leading the pack. The pace car came out to pick up the field, and by rule, was supposed to get directly in front of Villeneuve as the leader. But Villeneuve went by the pace car twice, not knowing they were trying to pick him up. Finally, the officials sorted out the field, the pit area was opened, and Villeneuve immediately went to the pits for service. He suffered a slow stop with several errors. He nearly pulled away with the fuel hose attached, then subsequently stalled as he pulled away.\n\nA few minutes after the race went back to green, [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] assessed [[Jacques Villeneuve]] a two-lap penalty for passing the pace car twice as they were trying to pick him up. The penalty dropped him from 3rd place to 27th. The two laps were effectively deleted from his scoring serial.\n\n===First half===\n[[Michael Andretti]] led 45 laps in the first half but on lap 77, he was abruptly knocked out of the race. [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] was leading in turn four, and [[Michael Andretti|Andretti]] was behind him in second place. Andretti caught him in turn four, as [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin|Gugelmin]] was slowing down to make a pit stop. Andretti tried to go around him on the outside, but got up into the \"marbles\" and brushed the wall exiting turn four, damaging the suspension. He veered across the track to enter the pits, to have the crew look over the car. The rear wishbone suspension was bent, and [[Michael Andretti|Andretti]] climbed out of the car, out of the race.\n\nAs Andretti was climbing from his car, [[Scott Sharp]] spun and wrecked in turn four.\n\nBy the time the field went back to green on lap 84, [[Jacques Villeneuve]] had made up one of his laps. He was running 20th, one lap down.\n\n===Second half===\nOn lap 124, [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andre Ribeiro]] stalled on the track with an electrical problem. By that time, [[Jacques Villeneuve]] had gotten his lap back, and was now on the lead lap in 12th place. Villeneuve caught another break when [[Paul Tracy]] slowed on the backstretch with electrical problems, bringing out another caution. \n\n[[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]] led the most laps (59) but did not manage to lead again after lap 138. The leaders were now [[Jimmy Vasser]], [[Scott Pruett]], and [[Scott Goodyear]]. [[Jacques Villeneuve]] was now up to 6th place. After Vasser pitted while leading on lap 157, Villeneuve retook the lead for the first time since his penalty. \n\nOn lap 162, [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] crashed in turn 2 as Villeneuve was preparing to pit. The race restarted on lap 169. Vasser led following pit stops by most of the drivers during the caution. A lap later, [[Scott Pruett]] passed him going down the backstretch for the lead. Vasser got high and hit the outside wall in the north chute. Pruett held point until shortly after the restart on lap 176 when Goodyear passed him. \n\nBy this stage of the race, the winds began to gust over 30 mph. On lap 184, with Goodyear still in front by almost a second, Pruett got high in turn 2 and bounced off the outside wall. Pruett\u2019s car spun across the backstretch, got airborne and backed into the catchfence, demolishing the rear end.\n\n===Finish===\nWith eleven laps to go, [[Scott Goodyear]] led [[Jacques Villeneuve]], [[Eliseo Salazar]] and [[Christian Fittipaldi]] under caution. The field prepared to go back to green on lap 190. Down the backstretch, Goodyear held back a little bit and allowed the pace car to clear ahead. [[United States Auto Club]] (USAC) official Don Bailey was driving the Corvette pace car, which was entering turn four. At the entrance of turn three, Goodyear and Villeneuve both accelerated, leaving a trail of tire marks behind. Villeneuve was right on his tail. Entering turn four, Goodyear continued to accelerate, but Villeneuve suddenly backed off to avoid passing the pace car. The two cars had caught up to the pace car in the middle of turn four, and it had not yet entered the pits. Scott Goodyear did not lift, blew by the pace car and proceeded to race down the front stretch. The rest of the field checked up and a gaggle of six cars nearly collided to avoid the pace car as it pulled into the pits.\n\nUSAC flagman Duane Sweeney put out the green flag, with Goodyear now well ahead of the rest of the cars. Villeneuve emerged from the incident still in second, and the rest of the field diced down the front stretch and funneled into turn one without incident.\n\nA few moments later, USAC race control announced that Scott Goodyear was being assessed a stop-and-go penalty for passing the pace car on the restart. Goodyear was in disbelief on his radio, insisting that he did not do anything wrong. He claimed that the green light was on, and many felt the pace car was going too slow. The black-flag was waved at Goodyear but he kept racing and chose not to acknowledge it. Goodyear's boss/team owner Steve Horne told Goodyear to keep going to the end believing they could protest the penalty eventually.\n\nSince he failed to heed the penalty, USAC ceased scoring Goodyear after lap 195. Therefore, when Jacques Villeneuve came around to complete 196 laps he was scored officially in the lead, with Christian Fittipaldi second and [[Bobby Rahal]] now third. Villeneuve led the rest of the way to win the race. On the last lap, [[Arie Luyendyk]] passed Villeneuve at the stripe to un-lap himself, and finished 7th on the lead lap. With his lap total stopped at 195 for ignoring the penalty, Goodyear sank through the standings to 15th place, 5 laps down.\n\nPole-sitter [[Scott Brayton]]'s day ended ten laps down in 17th place. His car was down on turbocharger boost, and after the race he quipped that he was so slow he felt he \"was in the way.\" Years later, it would be revealed that Brayton (and his teammate [[Arie Luyendyk]]), were secretly being penalized by USAC for illegally over-boosting their turbocharger plenums and tampering with the pop-off valves during practice and qualifying.<ref name=\"1995Rough\">{{cite news|url=http://8w.forix.com/indy95.html|title=The 1995 Indianapolis 500 controversy: Rough justice, but justice nonetheless|publisher=8W|first=Henri|last=Greuter|date=2012-01-11|accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trackforum.com/forums/showthread.php?36541-straight-line-speeds-at-indy&p=465754&viewfull=1#post465754|title=1995 menard boost|publisher=TrackForum.com|date=2004-01-02|accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref>\n\nScott Goodyear was visibly upset in an interview as he said to reporters: ''\"Disbelief is the best word to describe how I feel. I feel like I won this race. The pace-car was going too slow. ... I almost hit it. Scott Pruett almost hit it, Villeneuve almost hit it. He wasn't on the gas and I saw the green lights turn on and that meant go. That's all I can say. I stayed out because in my eyes it was perfect ... and if I came in and later found I didn't make a mistake then what are you going to do? It would have been too late and you won't get it back.\"''\n\n===Aftermath and legacy===\nThe finish was highly controversial, with [[Scott Goodyear]] passing the pace car emerging as the story of the race. [[Scott Goodyear|Goodyear]] claimed that he saw the green light on when he blew by the pace car, and the team threatened to protest. Video footage, however, was found that showed the yellow light was still on when it happened.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" />\n\nIn addition, scoring transponders in the pace car and the race cars showed the following:<ref>USAC Timing and Scoring Data \u2013 1995 Indianapolis 500</ref>\n*At the end of the backstretch, the pace car, turning its lights off, was clocked at 77&nbsp;mph. Goodyear was slightly slower at 68&nbsp;mph.\n*At the entry of turn three, where the pace car had been clocked at 83&nbsp;mph, Goodyear and Villeneuve flew by at 117&nbsp;mph and 118&nbsp;mph respectively.\n*Through the north chute, Goodyear increased his speed to about 166&nbsp;mph. The pace car was in the middle of turn 4.\n*By the exit of turn four, Goodyear blew by the pace car going about 193&nbsp;mph. The pace car was speeding up from about 98&nbsp;mph to over 117&nbsp;mph as it entered the pits. Villeneuve, anticipating the situation, quickly slowed back down to about 142&nbsp;mph.\n\nAfter video and timing and scoring evidence came out that was not supportive of Goodyear's case, the team ([[Tasman Motorsports]]) decided not to file a protest.<ref name=\"ABC-Milwaukee 1995\" /> Goodyear stated that he stayed out (and did not serve the stop-and-go penalty) because if he was in the right, and stayed out, he could still be scored as the winner. If he came in, he would have lost the theoretical lead, and would have had no chance of claiming victory.\n\nLargely overlooked was [[Bobby Rahal]]'s charge from 21st starting position to 3rd \u2013 the second year in a row he greatly improved on his starting position (in 1994, he started 28th and finished 3rd). It was also the first time in an odd year that Rahal finished the race. From 1982\u20131994, Rahal had a notable \"odd-even/good-bad\" streak at Indy. In even years, he had good finishes, and in odd years, his results were poor. Rahal's result was also accomplished in spite of a pit lane speeding penalty assessed during the race, a penalty that Rahal disputed in his post race television interview, as his car's on board speedometer had said that he was traveling 91&nbsp;mph, safely under the 100&nbsp;mph speed limit; Rahal called the penalty 'balderdash'. This would end up being his final Indy 500 as a driver. He returned to Indy seven years later as an owner in 2002.\n\n[[Arie Luyendyk|Arie Luyendyk's]] pass of [[Jacques Villeneuve]] at the start-finish line was noteworthy as it allowed him to complete the full 500 miles, becoming the second and final driver to complete 500 miles in a [[Buick]]/[[Team Menard|Menard]] powered car.  Luyendyk's 7th-place finish was the second-highest for the Buick/Menard V6, surpassed only by the third-place finish of [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]] in [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]].\n\n[[Jacques Villeneuve]] went on to win the [[1995 IndyCar season|1995 CART championship]], and subsequently signed with [[Williams F1|Williams]] in the offseason. With a growing cloud of controversy and uncertainty over a potential and looming open wheel \"split,\" the 1995 Indianapolis 500 marked a turning point in the sport. Within months, and by the [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 race]], the landscape and organizational harmony of Indy car racing would change drastically.

Since 1975, the awards have been given annually, usually in June.  The current name was adopted effective in 1991.\n\nThe awards offer prizes in four categories: alternative ([[experimental film]]), animation, documentary, and [[Fictional film|narrative]].  Gold, silver, and bronze awards may be given in each category, with accompanying cash grants of $5,000, $3,000, and $2,000, respectively, as of 2005.  Since 1981, a separate award has been given annually to a student filmmaker from outside the United States.\n\nSeveral award winners have gone on to significant achievement as filmmakers, including [[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Bob Saget]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Trey Parker]], [[Pete Docter]] and [[John Lasseter]].  Some of the award-winning student films have themselves been nominated for and/or won the [[Academy Award]] in the short film categories, including  ''[[Chicks in White Satin]]'', ''The Janitor'', ''[[Karl Hess: Toward Liberty]]'', ''[[The Lunch Date]]'', ''[[9 (2005 film)|9]]'', ''[[Quiero ser (I want to be...)]]'', ''The Red Jacket'', ''On the Line (Auf der Strecke)'', ''[[God of Love (film)|God of Love]]'', ''The Confession'' and ''[[4.1 Miles]]''.\n\nTo extend the impact and honor beyond the competition, a compilation presentation of the gold medal award-winning films is circulated each year free of charge to educational and non-profit organizations nationwide.\n\nCopies (and some elements) for over 90% of films honored with Student Academy Awards, along with recordings of many of the awards ceremonies, are held by the [[Academy Film Archive]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Academy Awards Collection|url=https://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/student-academy-awards-collection|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n== List of winners ==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====1st Annual Student Film Awards{{spaced ndash}} December 20, 1973====\n* '''Animation''':  ''Anti-matter'', Lewis Hall, Carlos Guiterrez-Mena{{spaced ndash}} [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (Los Angeles)\n* '''Documentary''':  ''You See, I've Had a Life'', Ben Levin, Mort Jordan{{spaced ndash}} [[Temple University]] ([[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania)\n* '''Dramatic''':  ''Manhattan Melody'', Reuben Trane, [[Ken Wiederhorn]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Columbia University]] (New York City)\n* '''Special Jury (Dramatic)''':  ''Norman Nurdelpick's Suspension: A Tribute to Alfred Hitchcock'', Bob Dahlin{{spaced ndash}}[[Northwestern University]] ([[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], Illinois)\n\n====2nd Annual Student Film Awards{{spaced ndash}} July 1, 1975====\n* '''Animation''': ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1q6JL8JbI Euphoria]'', Vincent Collins{{spaced ndash}} [[San Francisco Art Institute]] (San Francisco)\n* '''Documentary''':  ''Men's Lives'', Josh Hanig, Will Roberts{{spaced ndash}} [[Antioch College]] ([[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]], Ohio)\n* '''Dramatic''': ''Swag'', Bruce Postman{{spaced ndash}} [[Tisch School of the Arts|New York University School of the Arts]] (New York City)\n* '''Experimental''': ''Architecture of the Petroleum Age'', Scott Thomas{{spaced ndash}} [[Rice University]] ([[Houston]], Texas)\n* '''Special Jury (Dramatic)''': ''A Field of Honor'', [[Robert Zemeckis]] <ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/29000-i-wanna-hold-your-hand I Wanna Hold Your Hold (1978)|The Criterion Collection]</ref>{{spaced ndash}} [[University of Southern California]] (Los Angeles)\n\n====3rd Annual Student Film Awards{{spaced ndash}} June 23, 1976====\n* '''Animation''':  ''[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]'',<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aQr9H3lb27A]</ref> [[Mark Kirkland]], [[Richard Jefferies (screenwriter)|Richard Jefferies]]{{spaced ndash}} [[California Institute of the Arts]] ([[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California)\n* '''Documentary''':  ''What the Notes Say Karen Grossman'', Richard O'Neill{{spaced ndash}} [[Adelphi University]] ([[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], New York)\n* '''Dramatic''':  ''The Preparatory'', Terence Cahalan{{spaced ndash}} [[University of Southern California]] (Los Angeles)\n* '''Experimental''':  ''After Lumiere'', Joan Laine{{spaced ndash}} [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (Los Angeles)\n* '''Special Jury (Documentary)''':  ''The American Love Affair'', Lee M.

by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] in an annual competition for college and university filmmakers.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/07/us/ap-us-student-academy-awards.html?_r=0 The New York

named the '''Student Film Awards''' and were first presented in 1973. Since 1975, the awards have been given annually, usually in June.  The current name was adopted effective in 1991.\n\nThe awards offer prizes in four categories: alternative ([[experimental film]]), animation, documentary, and [[Fictional film|narrative]].  Gold, silver, and bronze awards may be given in each category, with accompanying cash grants of $5,000, $3,000, and $2,000, respectively, as of 2005.  Since 1981, a separate award has been given annually to a student filmmaker from outside the United States.\n\nSeveral award winners have gone on to significant achievement as filmmakers, including [[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Bob Saget]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Trey Parker]], [[Pete Docter]] and [[John Lasseter]].  Some of the award-winning student films have themselves been nominated for and/or won the [[Academy Award]] in the short film categories, including  ''[[Chicks in White Satin]]'', ''The Janitor'', ''[[Karl Hess: Toward Liberty]]'', ''[[The Lunch Date]]'', ''[[9 (2005 film)|9]]'', ''[[Quiero ser (I want to be...)]]'', ''The Red Jacket'', ''On the Line (Auf der Strecke)'', ''[[God of Love (film)|God of Love]]'', ''The Confession'' and ''[[4.1 Miles]]''.\n\nTo extend the impact and honor beyond the competition, a compilation presentation of the gold medal award-winning films is circulated each year free of charge to educational and non-profit organizations nationwide.\n\nCopies (and some elements) for over 90% of films honored with Student Academy Awards, along with recordings of many of the awards ceremonies, are held by the [[Academy Film Archive]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Academy Awards Collection|url=https://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/student-academy-awards-collection|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n== List of winners ==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====1st Annual Student Film Awards{{spaced ndash}} December 20, 1973====\n* '''Animation''':  ''Anti-matter'', Lewis Hall, Carlos Guiterrez-Mena{{spaced ndash}} [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (Los Angeles)\n* '''Documentary''':  ''You See, I've Had a Life'', Ben Levin, Mort Jordan{{spaced ndash}} [[Temple University]] ([[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania)\n* '''Dramatic''':  ''Manhattan Melody'', Reuben Trane, [[Ken Wiederhorn]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Columbia University]] (New York City)\n* '''Special Jury (Dramatic)''':  ''Norman Nurdelpick's Suspension: A Tribute to Alfred Hitchcock'', Bob Dahlin{{spaced ndash}}[[Northwestern University]] ([[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], Illinois)\n\n====2nd Annual Student Film Awards{{spaced ndash}} July 1, 1975====\n* '''Animation''': ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1q6JL8JbI Euphoria]'', Vincent Collins{{spaced ndash}} [[San Francisco Art Institute]] (San Francisco)\n* '''Documentary''':  ''Men's Lives'', Josh Hanig, Will Roberts{{spaced ndash}} [[Antioch College]] ([[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]], Ohio)\n* '''Dramatic''': ''Swag'', Bruce Postman{{spaced ndash}} [[Tisch School of the Arts|New York University School of the Arts]] (New York City)\n* '''Experimental''': ''Architecture of the Petroleum Age'', Scott Thomas{{spaced ndash}} [[Rice University]] ([[Houston]], Texas)\n* '''Special Jury (Dramatic)''': ''A Field of Honor'', [[Robert Zemeckis]] <ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/29000-i-wanna-hold-your-hand I Wanna Hold Your Hold (1978)|The Criterion Collection]</ref>{{spaced ndash}} [[University of Southern California]] (Los Angeles)\n\n====3rd Annual Student Film Awards{{spaced ndash}} June 23, 1976====\n* '''Animation''':  ''[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]'',<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aQr9H3lb27A]</ref> [[Mark Kirkland]], [[Richard Jefferies (screenwriter)|Richard Jefferies]]{{spaced ndash}} [[California Institute of the Arts]] ([[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California)\n* '''Documentary''':  ''What the Notes Say Karen Grossman'', Richard O'Neill{{spaced ndash}} [[Adelphi University]] ([[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], New York)\n* '''Dramatic''':  ''The Preparatory'', Terence Cahalan{{spaced ndash}} [[University of Southern California]] (Los Angeles)\n* '''Experimental''':  ''After Lumiere'', Joan Laine{{spaced ndash}} [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (Los Angeles)\n* '''Special Jury (Documentary)''':  ''The American Love Affair'', Lee M.

{"title_page": "Inr\u014d", "text_new": "{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}\n[[File:Inro exploded.jpg|thumb|right|''Inr\u014d'' components]]\nAn {{nihongo|'''''inr\u014d'''''|[[wiktionary:\u5370\u7c60|\u5370\u7c60]]}} is a traditional Japanese case for holding small objects, suspended from the [[obi (sash)|obi]] (sash) worn around the waist. They are often highly decorated, in a variety of materials and techniques, in particular often using [[Japanese lacquerware|lacquer]].\n\nBecause traditional Japanese robes lacked pockets, objects were often carried by hanging them from the obi in containers known as ''sagemono'' (a Japanese generic term for a hanging object attached to a sash).  Most ''sagemono'' were created for specialized contents, such as tobacco, pipes, writing brush and ink, but the type known as ''inr\u014d'' was suitable for carrying anything small.\n\n[[Image:Ikkei - Inro with Cranes Soaring by Mount Fuji, and Netsuke of a Turtle - Walters 67388.jpg|thumb|''Inro with Cranes Soaring by Mount Fuji'', and Netsuke of a Turtle. 19th century (Edo; Meiji)<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/11557\n |title= Inro with Cranes Soaring by Mount Fuji, and Netsuke of a Turtle}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]\n\nThe term ''inr\u014d'' derives from the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] roots ''in'' (from [[Middle Chinese]] ''jin'' {{lang|zh|\u5370}} \"[[Seal (East Asia)|seal]]\") and ''r\u014d'' (MC ''luwng'' {{lang|zh|\u7c60}} \"cage\").\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Netsuke-p1030001.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a man wearing an ''inr\u014d'' suspended with the help of a netsuke and held together with an ''ojime'']]\nConsisting of a stack of tiny, nested boxes, ''inr\u014d'' were most commonly used to carry [[Hanko (stamp)|identity seals]] and medicine.

They are often highly decorated, in a variety of materials and techniques, in particular often using [[Japanese lacquerware|lacquer]].\n\nBecause traditional Japanese robes lacked pockets, objects were often carried by hanging them from the obi in containers known as ''sagemono'' (a Japanese generic term for a hanging object attached to a sash).  Most ''sagemono'' were created for specialized contents, such as tobacco, pipes, writing brush and ink, but the type known as ''inr\u014d'' was suitable for carrying anything small.\n\n[[Image:Ikkei - Inro with Cranes Soaring by Mount Fuji, and Netsuke of a Turtle - Walters 67388.jpg|thumb|''Inro with Cranes Soaring by Mount Fuji'', and Netsuke of a Turtle. 19th century (Edo; Meiji)<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/11557\n |title= Inro with Cranes Soaring by Mount Fuji, and Netsuke of a Turtle}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]\n\nThe term ''inr\u014d'' derives from the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] roots ''in'' (from [[Middle Chinese]] ''jin'' {{lang|zh|\u5370}} \"[[Seal (East Asia)|seal]]\") and ''r\u014d'' (MC ''luwng'' {{lang|zh|\u7c60}} \"cage\").\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Netsuke-p1030001.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a man wearing an ''inr\u014d'' suspended with the help of a netsuke and held together with an ''ojime'']]\n Consisting of a stack of tiny nested boxes, ''inr\u014d'' were most commonly used to carry [[Hanko (stamp)|identity seals]] and medicine.
