The [[cornea]]l surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A [[Temporal bone|temporal]] (ear side) concentration of [[retinal ganglion cell]]s, important for binocular vision, indicates a role in [[predation]], while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Furthermore, this limited acuity is matched by a low [[cortical magnification]], a small [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and a large [[optic tectum]], suggesting that the [[Midbrain tectum|visual midbrain]] plays a more important role than the [[visual cortex]], as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system; an evolutionary process paralleled by the small number of electroreceptors in the [[short-beaked echidna]], which dwells in dry environments, whilst the [[long-beaked echidna]], which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes.<ref name=\"sensory_platypus\" />\n\n==Ecology and behaviour==\n[[File:Animaldentition ornithoryncusanatinus.png|thumb|left|Dentition, as illustrated in Knight's ''Sketches in Natural History'']]\n[[File:Platipus-on-the-surface.jpg|thumb|The platypus is very difficult to spot even on the surface of a river.]]\n[[File:Platypus.jpg|thumb|Platypus swimming]]\n[[File:Ornithorhynchus anatinus -Sydney Aquarium, Sydney, Australia -swimming-6a.ogv|thumbtime=50|right|thumb|Swimming underwater at [[Sydney Aquarium]], Australia]]\nThe platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Alps]] to the [[tropical rainforest]]s of coastal [[Queensland]] as far north as the base of the [[Cape York Peninsula]].<ref name=\"DPIW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/BHAN-53573T?open |title=Platypus |publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Water, Tasmania |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009211345/http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/BHAN-53573T?open |archivedate= 9 October 2006 |df= }}</ref> Inland, its distribution is not well known; it is extinct in [[South Australia]] (apart from an introduced population on [[Kangaroo Island]])<ref name=\"RKI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.adelaide.edu.au/research/fbp/ki_res/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706181309/http://www.ees.adelaide.edu.au/research/fbp/ki_res/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2004|title=Research on Kangaroo Island|publisher=University of Adelaide|date=4 July 2006| accessdate = 23 October 2006}}</ref> and is no longer found in the main part of the [[Murray-Darling Basin]], possibly due to the declining [[water quality]] brought about by extensive land clearing and [[irrigation]] schemes.<ref name=\"CSIRO\">{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.clw.csiro.au/publications/technical97/tr23-97.pdf\n|title=Impacts of water management in the Murray-Darling Basin on the platypus (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'') and the water rat (''Hydromus chrysogaster'')|author1=Scott, Anthony |author2=Grant, Tom |publisher=CSIRO Australia|date=November 1997| accessdate = 23 October 2006}}</ref> Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable; it appears to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers, and yet maintains a presence in others, for example, the lower [[Maribyrnong River|Maribyrnong]], that are quite degraded.<ref name=\"APC2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.platypus.asn.au/platypus_in_country_areas.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917002720/http://www.platypus.asn.au/platypus_in_country_areas.html |archive-date=17 September 2016 |title=Platypus in Country Areas |publisher=Australian Platypus Conservancy |accessdate=23 October 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn captivity, platypuses have survived to 17 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 11 years old.

The [[cornea]]l surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A [[Temporal bone|temporal]] (ear side) concentration of [[retinal ganglion cell]]s, important for binocular vision, indicates a role in [[predation]], while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Furthermore, this limited acuity is matched by a low [[cortical magnification]], a small [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and a large [[optic tectum]], suggesting that the [[Midbrain tectum|visual midbrain]] plays a more important role than the [[visual cortex]], as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system; an evolutionary process paralleled by the small number of electroreceptors in the [[short-beaked echidna]], which dwells in dry environments, whilst the [[long-beaked echidna]], which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes.<ref name=\"sensory_platypus\" />\n\n==Ecology and behaviour==\n[[File:Animaldentition ornithoryncusanatinus.png|thumb|left|Dentition, as illustrated in Knight's ''Sketches in Natural History'']]\n[[File:Platipus-on-the-surface.jpg|thumb|The platypus is very difficult to spot even on the surface of a river.]]\n[[File:Platypus.jpg|thumb|Platypus swimming]]\n[[File:Ornithorhynchus anatinus -Sydney Aquarium, Sydney, Australia -swimming-6a.ogv|thumbtime=50|right|thumb|Swimming underwater at [[Sydney Aquarium]], Australia]]\nThe platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Alps]] to the [[tropical rainforest]]s of coastal [[Queensland]] as far north as the base of the [[Cape York Peninsula]].<ref name=\"DPIW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/BHAN-53573T?open |title=Platypus |publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Water, Tasmania |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009211345/http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/BHAN-53573T?open |archivedate= 9 October 2006 |df= }}</ref> Inland, its distribution is not well known; it is extinct in [[South Australia]] (apart from an introduced population on [[Kangaroo Island]])<ref name=\"RKI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.adelaide.edu.au/research/fbp/ki_res/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706181309/http://www.ees.adelaide.edu.au/research/fbp/ki_res/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2004|title=Research on Kangaroo Island|publisher=University of Adelaide|date=4 July 2006| accessdate = 23 October 2006}}</ref> and is no longer found in the main part of the [[Murray-Darling Basin]], possibly due to the declining [[water quality]] brought about by extensive land clearing and [[irrigation]] schemes.<ref name=\"CSIRO\">{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.clw.csiro.au/publications/technical97/tr23-97.pdf\n|title=Impacts of water management in the Murray-Darling Basin on the platypus (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'') and the water rat (''Hydromus chrysogaster'')|author1=Scott, Anthony |author2=Grant, Tom |publisher=CSIRO Australia|date=November 1997| accessdate = 23 October 2006}}</ref> Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable; it appears to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers, and yet maintains a presence in others, for example, the lower [[Maribyrnong River|Maribyrnong]], that are quite degraded.<ref name=\"APC2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.platypus.asn.au/platypus_in_country_areas.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917002720/http://www.platypus.asn.au/platypus_in_country_areas.html |archive-date=17 September 2016 |title=Platypus in Country Areas |publisher=Australian Platypus Conservancy |accessdate=23 October 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn captivity, platypuses have survived to 17 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 11 years old.

He prefers playing games and being mischievous, but can be rather hasty and uncoordinated. He would rather look cool than follow directions, but cares about Valentino above anything else. Additionally, he is really bad at spelling, prefers being dirty and is easily duped into committing certain acts.\n* Valentino \"Val\" (voiced by [[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]] [pilot]; Sean-Ryan Petersen [series]): Victor's older half-brother who is more cautious and likes taking in the smaller things in life. He has better coordination than Victor and is smarter, but still looks out for him and cares for his well-being. He is overweight, but seems pretty nimble at times, and is very knowledgeable about ancient Mexican culture and its history.\n* Chata (voiced by Carla Tassara [pilot]; Laura Patalano [series]): the boys' grandmother, with whom they stay in Monte Macabre for the summer. She appears to be blind, is stern, yet kind. The pilot depicts her as an undead spirit that can take on a human form, while the series only implies her supernatural connections.\n* Maria Teresa (voiced by Frankie Qui\u00f1ones): Charlene and Pinapple's mean-spirited grandmother and Chata's rival. She owns her own taco establishment.\n** Charlene (voiced by Cristina Milizia): A strange and macabre little girl who picks on/hangs out with Vic and Val. She has connections to the supernatural and likes using them on the brothers. She has a crush on Victor and takes every chance to be involved with whatever he is doing.\n** Pineapple (voiced by Diego Molano): A large, lumbering, monosyllabic boy who is Charlene's brother. He acts as a stooge for her and, despite his intimidating appearance, is shown to like dancing and be sympathetic.\n* Julio \"Don\" Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by Jason Hightower): The local [[mini-mart]] owner who gets caught up in Vic and Val's antics, and is well-versed in Mexican and Latin-american folklore and cryptids. He seems to be attracted to Grandma Chata and sweats a lot in her presence.\n* Xochi Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by [[Cristina Vee]]): Don Jalape\u00f1o's teenage daughter who tends to the supernatural plants in the back of the store.

Located {{convert|1|NM|km mi}} northeast<ref name=\"aip_ekbi\"/> of [[Billund, Denmark|Billund]], it serves as one of the country's busiest [[Cargo airline|air cargo]] centres, as well as a [[charter airline]] destination. Most major european airports are connected to Billund via multiple daily scheduled flights. Nearby [[Legoland Billund]] park is the largest tourist attraction in Denmark outside Copenhagen.\n\n==History==\nBillund Airport had its beginning in 1961 when the son of the founder of [[the Lego Group]], [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen]], established a private 800-meter long runway and hangar north of his factory in Billund. With Christiansen as a key driver, more of the neighbouring municipalities were included in the group of owners, and it was planned that the airport should be expanded to a regular public airport.\n\nThe construction of the new airport was carried out during 1964 and the airport opened on 1 November, with one runway at 1660 meters in length and 45 meters width, a small platform where aircraft could be served, and a control tower to the controller. Hans Erik Christensen, the former chief pilot at LEGO became director, and the passengers were handled in LEGO's hangar until the first terminal building was opened in the spring of 1966. The airport was continuously expanded the following years, with new facilities, terminal buildings, lounge, tax-free area and hangars where LC Johansen's studio often participated as an architect (today called the Johannsen Architects), while other work was carried out by the airport's own studio.\n\nIn 1997 they had an architectural competition for a new 430,000&nbsp;ft\u00b2 (40,000 m\u00b2) passenger terminal, designed to serve 3.5 million passengers a year, north of the original airport. KHR Architects won the assignment and completed the construction in co-operation with COWI, and at the end of May 2002 the new passenger terminal was put to use, as the first phase of the future expansion, which is scheduled to take place north of the start and runway, while air cargo services, business and private aviation will continue to be served from the existing buildings south of the runway. In connection with this expansion, the largest since the beginning of the airport, it was with effect from 1 January 1997 turned into a Joint-stock company, Billund Airport A/S, with the former members [[Vejle County]] and municipalities [[Vejle Municipality (1970\u20132006)|Vejle]], [[Kolding Municipality|Kolding]], [[Grindsted Municipality|Grindsted]], [[Billund Municipality|Billund]], and [[Give Municipality|Give]] as shareholders.\n\nIn 2008, the entire runway was renovated and paved, and a new taxiway was built, nicknamed \"Mike\". This major task only took 14 hours. The runway was closed over night between the hours 23:00 and 06:00. This did not prevent a [[Boeing 737-800]] from [[Ryanair]] landing at one end of the runway, while they worked at the other end. The same year was also a record year for the airport. 2,546,856 passengers passed through the terminals, an increase of 12.7 percent compared with 2007.\n\nFrom mid-2009, the airport was served by 9 airlines flying regular flight service, of which [[KLM]] had the busiest route with over 200,000 annual passengers to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam Schiphol]]. In 2011, Ryanair announced that Billund Airport with effect from 25 March 2012 would be the base for two Boeing 737 aircraft. At the same time Ryanair published 5 new routes, so that, from the summer of 2012, they would fly to 19 destinations.\n\nFrom 1 January 2007 the owners are: Vejle Municipality (34.3%), Kolding Municipality (25.9%), Billund Municipality (15%), Horsens Municipality (10.7%), Fredericia Municipality (6.9%), Hedensted Municipality (6.1%), Brande Municipality (1.0%) and Skanderborg Municipality (0.1%).\n\nIn 2014, LEGO produced a special [[Lego Architecture]] kit, which could only be bought in the departure hall of the airport.\n\nA new terminal is slated for opening in the fall of 2019.<ref>https://jyllands-posten.dk/#ia11551519;finans</ref> It cost more than 100 million Danish kroner.\n\n==Capabilities==\nThe airport handles an average of more than three million passengers a year, and millions of pounds of cargo. The airport's main runway can handle airliners as large as the Boeing 747, although most passengers arrive on smaller aeroplanes, such as [[ATR-72]]s, [[Boeing 737]]s and [[Airbus 320 family|Airbus A320s]].
