The awards are organized and awarded by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA), a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit association]] of professional science fiction and fantasy writers. They were first given in 1966 at a ceremony created for the awards, and are given in four categories for different lengths of literary works. A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974\u201378 and 2000\u201309, and a sixth category for game writing was begun in 2018. The rules governing the Nebula Awards have changed several times during the awards' history, most recently in 2010. The [[SFWA Nebula Conference]], at which the awards are announced and presented, is held each spring in the United States. Locations vary from year to year.\n\nThe Nebula Awards are one of the best known and most prestigious science fiction and fantasy awards<ref name=\"BOTSSF\"/> and together with the [[Hugo Awards]] have been called \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\".<ref name=\"Guardianquote\"/> Winning works have been published in special collections, and winners and nominees are often noted as such on the books' cover. SFWA identifies the awards by the year of publication, that is, the year prior to the year in which the award is given.\n\nFor lists of winners and nominees for each Nebula category, see the [[#Categories|list of categories]] below.\n\n==Award==\n\nThe Nebula Awards are given annually by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] fiction published during the previous year. To be eligible for consideration works must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The awards are not limited to American citizens or members of SFWA. Works translated into English are also eligible.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/>\n\nThere are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the nominators and voters, rather than to SFWA.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe winner receives a trophy but no cash prize; the trophy is a transparent block with an embedded glitter spiral [[nebula]] and gemstones cut to resemble planets.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The trophy itself was designed for the first awards by J. A. Lawrence, based on a sketch by [[Kate Wilhelm]], and has remained the same ever since.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/>\n\nNebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA. Works are nominated each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, with the six works that receive the most nominations forming the final ballot. Additional nominees are possible in the case of ties. Members then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, though they can decline nominations. Ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nebula Trophy.jpg|thumb|alt=Nebula Award|upright|Nebula Award for Best Novella for ''[[The Green Leopard Plague]]'', by [[Walter Jon Williams]]]]\n\nThe first Nebulas were given in 1966, for works published in 1965. The idea for such an award, funded by the sales of anthologies collecting the winning works, was proposed by SFWA secretary-treasurer [[Lloyd Biggle, Jr.]] in 1965.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/> The idea was based on the [[Edgar Award]]s, presented by the [[Mystery Writers of America]], and the idea to have a ceremony at which to present them was prompted by the Edgar and [[Hugo Award]]s.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The initial ceremony consisted of four literary awards, for [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Novels]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novella|Novellas]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|Novelettes]], and [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story|Short Stories]], which have been presented every year since. A Script award was also presented from 1974 to 1978 under the names Best Dramatic Presentation and Best Dramatic Writing and again from 2000 through 2009 as Best Script, but after 2009 it was again removed and replaced by SFWA with the [[Ray Bradbury Award]].<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/><ref name=\"LOCUSbrad\"/> In 2018, a new [[Nebula Award for Best Game Writing|Game Writing]] category was added, for writing in video and tabletop games.<ref name=\"LOCUSgames\"/>\n\nPrior to 2009, the Nebula Awards employed a rolling eligibility system. Each work was eligible to qualify for the ballot for one year following its date of publication. As a consequence of rolling eligibility, there was the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create the final ballot.<ref name=\"Locusrules\"/> In 1970, the option was added for voters to select \"no award\" if they felt that no nominated work was worthy of winning; this happened in 1971 in the Short Story category and in 1977 in the Script category.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nBeginning in 1980 the eligibility year for nominations was set to the calendar year, rather than December\u2013November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books as the beginning of their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/>\n\n==Categories==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"75%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"30%\" scope=\"col\"|Categories\n! width=\"10%\" scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|Years\n! width=\"60%\" scope=\"col\"|Description\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" | [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of 40,000 words or more\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of between 17,500 and 40,000 words\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|Best Novelette]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of between 7,500 and 17,500 words\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story|Best Short Story]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of less than 7,500 words\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Script|Best Script]]\n| 1974\u20131978, 2000\u20132009 || Movie or television episode scripts\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Game Writing|Best Game Writing]]\n| 2018\u2013present || Writing in video and tabletop games\n|}\n\nBeside the Nebulas, several other awards and honors are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony, though not necessarily every year. Two of them are annual literary awards voted by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot:<ref name=\"2012awards\"/> the [[Andre Norton Award|Andre Norton Award for Outstanding Young Adult Science Fiction or Fantasy Book]], inaugurated 2006, and the [[Ray Bradbury Award|Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation]], which replaced the Best Script award in 2010.<ref name=SFEneb/><ref name=SFWAnorton/><ref name=\"LOCUSbrad\"/> The others are the [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award]] since 1975 for \"lifetime achievement in science fiction and/or fantasy\", the [[Author Emeritus]] since 1995 for contributions to the field, the Kevin O'Donnell, Jr. Award for service to SFWA, and the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award since 2009 for significant impact on speculative fiction.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/><ref name=\"SFWAservice\"/> All four are discretionary but a Grand Master, selected by the officers and past presidents, has been named every year for more than a decade.<ref name=LOCUSgm/> The Solstice Award may be presented posthumously (where only living writers may be named Grand Master or Author Emeritus); in all, twelve have been awarded in five years to 2013.<ref name=\"SFWAsolstice\"/>\n\n==Recognition==\n\nThe Nebula Awards have been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name=\"Guardianquote\"/><ref name=\"TechRepquote\"/> Along with the [[Hugo Award]], the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' terming it \"science fiction's most prestigious award\", and [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referring to it and the Hugo Award as \"the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards\".<ref name=\"SALONnebula\"/><ref name=\"BOTSSF\"/> [[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Nebula Award provided \"more literary judgment\" while the Hugo was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit, though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.<ref name=\"TYS\"/> [[David Langford]] and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] stated in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (2012) that the two awards were often given to the same works, and noted that some critics felt that the Nebula selection reflected \"political as much as literary ability\" as it did not seem to focus as much on literary talent over popularity as expected.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/>\n\nSeveral people within the publishing industry have said that winning or being nominated for a Nebula Award has effects on the author's career and the sales of that work. [[Spider Robinson]] in 1992, as quoted in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that publishers \"pay careful attention\" to who wins a Nebula Award.<ref name=\"SFC\"/> Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Nebula Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a \"powerful inducement\" to science fiction fans to buy a novel, and [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Nebula Award on the cover \"demonstrably\" increased sales for that novel.<ref name=\"MBW\"/><ref name=\"FWFA\"/>\n\nThere have been several anthologies collecting Nebula-winning short fiction. The series ''Nebula Winners'', published yearly by SFWA and edited by a variety of SFWA members and renamed as the ''Nebula Awards Showcase'' series since 1999, was started in 1966 as a collection of short story winners and nominees for that year.<ref name=\"SFEanth\"/> The sales of these anthologies were intended to pay for presenting the awards themselves.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/> The anthology ''The Best of the Nebulas'' (1989), edited by [[Ben Bova]], collected winners of Nebula awards from 1966 through 1986 officially selected by SFWA members.<ref name=\"HWSFF\"/> The unofficial anthology ''Nebula Award Winning Novellas'' (1994), edited by [[Martin H. Greenberg]], contained ten stories which had won the novella award between 1970 and 1989.<ref name=\"SFEanth\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Speculative fiction}}\n* [[Outline of science

Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/>\n\n==Categories==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"75%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"30%\" scope=\"col\"|Categories\n! width=\"10%\" scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|Years\n! width=\"60%\" scope=\"col\"|Description\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" | [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of 40,000 words or more\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of between 17,500 and 40,000 words\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|Best Novelette]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of between 7,500 and 17,500 words\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story|Best Short Story]]\n| 1966\u2013present || Stories of less than 7,500 words\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Script|Best Script]]\n| 1974\u20131978, 2000\u20132009 || Movie or television episode scripts\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"| [[Nebula Award for Best Game Writing|Best Game Writing]]\n| 2018\u2013present || Writing in video and tabletop games\n|}\n\nBeside the Nebulas, several other awards and honors are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony, though not necessarily every year. Two of them are annual literary awards voted by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot:<ref name=\"2012awards\"/> the [[Andre Norton Award|Andre Norton Award for Outstanding Young Adult Science Fiction or Fantasy Book]], inaugurated 2006, and the [[Ray Bradbury Award|Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation]], which replaced the Best Script award in 2010.<ref name=SFEneb/><ref name=SFWAnorton/><ref name=\"LOCUSbrad\"/> The others are the [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award]] since 1975 for \"lifetime achievement in science fiction and/or fantasy\", the [[Author Emeritus]] since 1995 for contributions to the field, the Kevin O'Donnell, Jr. Award for service to SFWA, and the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award since 2009 for significant impact on speculative fiction.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/><ref name=\"SFWAservice\"/> All four are discretionary but a Grand Master, selected by the officers and past presidents, has been named every year for more than a decade.<ref name=LOCUSgm/> The Solstice Award may be presented posthumously (where only living writers may be named Grand Master or Author Emeritus); in all, twelve have been awarded in five years to 2013.<ref name=\"SFWAsolstice\"/>\n\n==Recognition==\n\nThe Nebula Awards have been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name=\"Guardianquote\"/><ref name=\"TechRepquote\"/> Along with the [[Hugo Award]], the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' terming it \"science fiction's most prestigious award\", and [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referring to it and the Hugo Award as \"the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards\".<ref name=\"SALONnebula\"/><ref name=\"BOTSSF\"/> [[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Nebula Award provided \"more literary judgment\" while the Hugo was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit, though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.<ref name=\"TYS\"/> [[David Langford]] and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] stated in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (2012) that the two awards were often given to the same works, and noted that some critics felt that the Nebula selection reflected \"political as much as literary ability\" as it did not seem to focus as much on literary talent over popularity as expected.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/>\n\nSeveral people within the publishing industry have said that winning or being nominated for a Nebula Award has effects on the author's career and the sales of that work. [[Spider Robinson]] in 1992, as quoted in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that publishers \"pay careful attention\" to who wins a Nebula Award.<ref name=\"SFC\"/> Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Nebula Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a \"powerful inducement\" to science fiction fans to buy a novel, and [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Nebula Award on the cover \"demonstrably\" increased sales for that novel.<ref name=\"MBW\"/><ref name=\"FWFA\"/>\n\nThere have been several anthologies collecting Nebula-winning short fiction. The series ''Nebula Winners'', published yearly by SFWA and edited by a variety of SFWA members and renamed as the ''Nebula Awards Showcase'' series since 1999, was started in 1966 as a collection of short story winners and nominees for that year.<ref name=\"SFEanth\"/> The sales of these anthologies were intended to pay for presenting the awards themselves.<ref name=\"SFEneb\"/> The anthology ''The Best of the Nebulas'' (1989), edited by [[Ben Bova]], collected winners of Nebula awards from 1966 through 1986 officially selected by SFWA members.<ref name=\"HWSFF\"/> The unofficial anthology ''Nebula Award Winning Novellas'' (1994), edited by [[Martin H. Greenberg]], contained ten stories which had won the novella award between 1970 and 1989.<ref name=\"SFEanth\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Speculative fiction}}\n* [[Outline of science

However, all of the songs that had been previously released were altered, most notably \"Do You Right\", where nearly all of the lyrics were changed. SA also changed his main verses in \"Freak Out\", \"Feels So Good\" and \"Fuck The Bullshit\". The breakdown in \"Plain\" was completely changed musically, and the lyrics were re-arranged. The first pressing was originally manufactured and distributed by \"Warner Bros. Records Inc.\" and thus bears the \"WB\" logo in the bottom right corner. Later issues were manufactured and distributed by \"RED\" in 1994, \"Mercury Records\" in 1996 and most recently \"Volcano\".

However, all of the songs that had been previously released were altered, most notably \"Do You Right\", where nearly all of the lyrics were changed. SA also changed his main verses in \"Freak Out\", \"Feels So Good\" and \"Fuck The Bullshit\". The breakdown in \"Plain\" was completely changed musically, and the lyrics were re-arranged. The first pressing was originally manufactured and distributed by \"Warner Bros. Records Inc.\" and thus bears the \"WB\" logo in the bottom right corner. Later issues were manufactured and distributed by \"RED\" in 1994, \"Mercury Records\" in 1996 and most recently \"Volcano\".

A classically trained musician, Ronson was known for his melodic approach to guitar playing.

He was the first son of George and Minnie Ronson and had two younger siblings, Maggi and David.<ref name=\"About Mick\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maggironson.com/about-mick |title=About Mick |publisher=Maggi Ronson |date= |accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> As a child he was trained classically to play piano, [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], violin, and (later) the [[Pump organ|harmonium]]. He initially wanted to be a cellist, but moved to guitar upon discovering the music of [[Duane Eddy]], whose sound on the bass notes of his guitar sounded to Ronson similar to that of the cello.<ref name=\"Hunter/Ronson1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8raYr-48h0|title=Mick Ronson Ian Hunter and David Bowie|last=Ronson|first=Mick|work=Performance and interview after|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref> He joined his first band, The Mariners, in November 1963, when he was 17. His stage debut with The Mariners was in support of the Keith Herd Band at [[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]] Village Hall, a gig for which the band travelled 35 miles and got paid 10 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] (50p). While Ronson was working with The Mariners, another local Hull group \u2013 The Crestas \u2013 recruited him on the advice of The Mariners' bassist John Griffiths. With Ronson on board the Crestas gained a solid reputation, making regular appearances at local halls: Mondays at the Halfway House in Hull, Thursdays at the Ferryboat Hotel, Fridays at the Regal Ballroom in [[Beverley]], and Sundays at the Duke of Cumberland in [[North Ferriby]].\n\nIn 1965, Ronson left The Crestas, moving to London to seek work. He took a part-time job as a mechanic, and joined a band called The Voice, replacing Miller Anderson. Soon afterwards, Crestas' drummer Dave Bradfield travelled to London, replacing the Voice's previous drummer. After playing a few dates with the group, Ronson and Bradfield returned from a weekend in Hull to find their gear piled at their flat and a note explaining that the rest of the group had gone to The Bahamas. Ronson stayed in London and teamed up briefly with a soul band called The Wanted, before eventually returning to Hull. In 1966, he joined Hull's top local band, [[The Rats (British band)|The Rats]], joining singer Benny Marshall, bassist Geoff Appleby, and drummer Jim Simpson (who was subsequently replaced by Clive Taylor and then John Cambridge). The group played the local circuit, and made a few unsuccessful trips to London and Paris.<ref>[http://www.justabuzz.com/ga-0-bio.shtml\"Geoff Appleby - Biography\"], \"Just a Buzz\".</ref>\n\nIn 1967 The Rats recorded the one-off [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] track, \"The Rise and Fall of Bernie Gripplestone\"<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book|first=Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher= Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh, UK|pages=825\u201326|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> at [[Fairview Studios]] in [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] and can be heard on the 2008 release, ''Front Room Masters \u2013 Fairview Studios 1966\u20131973''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontroommasters.org|title=About the Project|publisher=Frontroom Masters|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> 1968 saw the band change their name briefly to Treacle and book another recording session at Fairview Studios in 1969, before reverting to their original name. Around this time, Ronson was recommended by [[Rick Kemp]] to play guitar on [[Michael Chapman (singer)|Michael Chapman]]'s ''Fully Qualified Survivor'' album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Keith 'Ched' Cheesman joined The Rats replacing Geoff Appleby on bass and the line up of Ronson, Marshall, Cheesman and Cambridge entered Fairview studio to record \"Guitar Boogie\", \"Stop and Get A Hold of Myself\" and \"Morning Dew\".\n \nWhen John Cambridge left The Rats to join his former [[The Hullaballoos|Hullaballoos]] bandmate Mick Wayne in Junior's Eyes, he was replaced by [[Mick Woodmansey|Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey]]. In November 1969, the band recorded a final session at Fairview, taping \"Telephone Blues\" and \"Early in Spring\".\n\nIn March 1970, during the recording sessions for [[Elton John]]'s album ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'', Ronson played guitar on the track \"[[Madman Across the Water]]\". This song, however, was not included in the original release. The recording featuring Ronson was released on the 1992 [[compilation album]], ''Rare Masters'', as well as the 1995 reissue and 2008 deluxe edition of ''Tumbleweed Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tumbleweed-connection-bonus-tracks-mw0000650322 |title=Tumbleweed Connection \u2013 Elton John : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=30 October 1970 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bowie era==\nEarly in 1970, John Cambridge came back to Hull in search of Ronson, intent upon recruiting him for a new [[David Bowie]] backing band called [[The Hype (David Bowie band)|The Hype]]. He found Ronson marking out a rugby pitch, one of his duties as a Parks Department gardener for [[Hull City Council]]. Having failed in his earlier attempts in London, Ronson was reluctant, but eventually agreed to accompany Cambridge to a meeting with Bowie. Two days later, on 5 February, Ronson made his debut with Bowie on [[John Peel]]'s national [[BBC Radio 1]] show.\n\nThe Hype played their first gig at [[The Roundhouse]] on 22 February with a line-up that included Bowie, Ronson, Cambridge, and producer/bassist [[Tony Visconti]]. The group dressed up in [[superhero]] costumes, with Bowie as Rainbowman, Visconti as Hypeman, Ronson as Gangsterman, and Cambridge as Cowboyman. Also on the bill that day were [[Bachdenkel]], [[The Groundhogs]] and [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]]. The following day they performed at the Streatham Arms in London under the pseudonym of 'Harry The Butcher'. They also performed on 28 February at the Basildon [[Arts Lab]] experimental music club at the [[Basildon]] Arts Centre in [[Essex]], billed as 'David Bowie's New Electric Band'. Also on the bill were [[High Tide (band)|High Tide]], Overson and [[Iron Butterfly]]. [[Strawbs]] were due to perform but were replaced by Bowie's New Electric Band. John Cambridge left in March, again replaced by [[Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Weird|Gilly|2009|p=55}} In April 1970, Ronson, Woodmansey, and Visconti started recording Bowie's ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' album.{{sfn|Weird|Gilly|2009|p=57}}\n\nDuring the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', the trio of Ronson, Visconti, and Woodmansey \u2013 still under The Hype moniker \u2013 signed to [[Vertigo Records]]. The group recruited Benny Marshall from The Rats as vocalist, and entered the studio to record an album. By the time a single appeared, The Hype had been renamed Ronno. \"4th Hour of My Sleep\" was released on Vertigo to an indifferent reception in January 1971.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song was written by Tucker Zimmerman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuckerzimmerman.org/discography |title=Discography |publisher=Tucker Zimmerman |accessdate=14 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021182828/http://www.tuckerzimmerman.org/discography |archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] was a Ronson/Marshall composition called \"Powers of Darkness\". The Ronno album was never completed.\n\nBowie's backing ensemble, which now included [[Trevor Bolder]], who had replaced Visconti on bass guitar, and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], were used in the recording of ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. The departure of Visconti also meant that Ronson, with Bowie, took over the arrangements, while [[Ken Scott]] co-produced with Bowie. ''Hunky Dory'' featured Ronson's string arrangements on several tracks, including \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life On Mars?]]\".{{sfn|Weird|Gilly|2009|p=68}}\n\nIt was this band, minus Wakeman, that became known as [[The Spiders from Mars]] from the title of the next Bowie album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Again, Ronson was a key part of ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', providing string arrangements and various instrumentation, as well as playing lead guitar. Ronson and Bowie achieved some notoriety over the concerts promoting this album, when Bowie would simulate [[Oral sex|fellatio]] on Ronson's guitar as he played. Ronson's guitar and arranging during the Spiders from Mars era provided much of the underpinning for later [[punk rock]] musicians.<ref>{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Taylor|year=2004|title=The A to X of Alternative Music|edition= 1st|publisher=Xfm|location= London, UK|isbn=0-8264-8217-1|page=45}}</ref> In 1972 Ronson provided a strings-and-brass arrangement for the song \"Sea Diver\" on the Bowie-produced ''[[All the Young Dudes (album)|All the Young Dudes]]'' album for [[Mott the Hoople]]. Ronson co-produced [[Lou Reed]]'s album ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' with Bowie, playing lead guitar and piano on the songs \"[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]\" and \"[[Satellite of Love]]\". Again with Bowie, he re-recorded and produced the track \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold the World]]\" for [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]],<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia 3\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=1998|title=Guinness Rockopedia|edition=1st|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd.|location=London, UK|page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/248 248]|isbn=0-85112-072-5|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/248}}</ref> released as a single in the UK, and played on a few tracks on the [[Dana Gillespie]] album ''Weren't Born a Man''. Ronson appeared on the 1972 [[country rock]] album ''[[Bustin' Out]]'' by [[Pure Prairie League]], where he undertook string ensemble arrangements and contributed guitar and vocals on several tracks, most notably \"Angel #9\", (which Ronson recorded for his second solo LP Play Don't Worry), string arrangements on \"Boulder Skies\" and \"Call Me, Tell Me\", and helped write and arrange \"Amie\".''\n\nHis guitar work was next heard on Bowie's ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and 1973 [[cover version|covers]] album ''[[Pin Ups (album)|Pin Ups]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pin-ups-mw0000034411/credits|title=Pin Ups \u2013 David Bowie: Credits|publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=1998|title=Guinness Rockopedia|edition=1st|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd.|location=London, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/57 57\u201358]|isbn=0-85112-072-5|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/57}}</ref> However, he was absent from the subsequent ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' album. In September 1983 he was a special guest at the Toronto leg of the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]], playing lead guitar during the performance of \"[[The Jean Genie]]\". He had only been asked to play the day before, and later recalled:\n{{quote|I was playing [[Earl Slick|[Earl] Slick]]'s guitar ... I had heard Slick play solos all night so I decided not to play solos and I just went out and thrashed the guitar. I ''really'' thrashed the guitar, I was waving the guitar above my head and all sorts of things. It was funny afterwards because David said, 'You should have seen [Earl Slick's] face...' meaning he looked petrified. I had his prize guitar and I was swinging it around my head and Slick's going 'Waaaa... watch my guitar', you know. I was banging into it and it was going round my head. Poor Slick. I mean, I didn't know it was his ''special'' guitar, I just thought it was a guitar, a lump of wood with six strings.<ref name=SIDC>{{citation|title=David Bowie: The Starzone Interviews|editor=David Currie|isbn= 0711906858|year=1985|publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref>}}\n\nBowie said in a 1994 interview that \"Mick was the perfect foil for the Ziggy character. He was very much a salt-of-the-earth type, the blunt northerner with a defiantly masculine personality, so that what you got was the old-fashioned Yin and Yang thing. As a rock duo, I thought we were every bit as good as Mick and Keith or Axl and Slash.

His solo debut ''[[Slaughter on 10th Avenue (Mick Ronson album)|Slaughter on 10th Avenue]]'', featured a version of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", as well as Ronson's most famous solo track, \"Only After Dark\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In addition, his sister, Margaret (Maggi) Ronson, provided the backing vocals for the set. Between this and the 1975 follow-up, Ronson had a short-lived stint with [[Mott the Hoople]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nHe then became a long-time collaborator with Mott's former leader [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]], commencing with the album ''[[Ian Hunter (album)|Ian Hunter]]''<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location= London, UK|page=271|id=CN 5585}}</ref> (UK No. 21) and featuring the [[UK Singles Chart]] No. 14 hit \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\",<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums 2\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title= British Hit Singles & Albums|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=263}}</ref> including a spell touring as the Hunter Ronson Band.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1980, the live album ''[[Welcome to the Club (Ian Hunter album)|Welcome to the Club]]'' was released, including a couple of Ronson contributions, although it also contained a few studio-based tracks \u2013 one of which was a Hunter/Ronson composition. In 1974, Ronson secured the No. 2 spot from a reader's poll in ''[[Creem]]'' magazine as the best guitarist that year (with [[Jimmy Page]] taking first place), and [[Eric Clapton]] in third place after Ronson.<ref name=\"''Creem'' magazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/creem_lists.htm|title=CREEM MAGAZINE 1974 READER POLL RESULTS|date=1995\u20132010|publisher=Concept Copyright Julian White|accessdate=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nRonson contributed guitar to the title track of the 1976 [[David Cassidy]] release ''[[Getting It in the Street]]''. On 11 February 1977 the single \"Billy Porter\" (b/w \"Seven Days\") was released on RCA Victor Records, but did not chart. [[Roger Daltrey]] employed Ronson's guitar on his 1977 solo release ''[[One of the Boys (Roger Daltrey album)|One of the Boys]]''. In 1979, Ronson and Hunter produced and played on the [[Ellen Foley]] debut album, ''[[Night Out (album)|Night Out]]'', with \"We Belong to the Night\" and the hit single \"What's a Matter Baby\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 1982, Ronson worked with [[John Mellencamp]] on his ''[[American Fool]]'' album, and in particular the song \"[[Jack & Diane]]\": <blockquote>\"I owe Mick Ronson the hit song 'Jack & Diane'. Mick was very instrumental in helping me arrange that song, as I'd thrown it on the junk heap. Ronson came down and played on three or four tracks and worked on the American Fool record for four or five weeks. All of a sudden, for 'Jack & Diane', Mick said 'Johnny, you should put baby rattles on there.' I thought, 'What the fuck does put baby rattles on the record mean? So he put the percussion on there and then he sang the part 'let it rock, let it roll' as a choir-ish-type thing, which had never occurred to me. And that is the part everybody remembers on the song. It was Ronson's idea.\" (John Mellencamp, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, January 2008, p.61)</blockquote> Both \"Jack & Diane\" and ''American Fool'' topped their respective US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[record chart|charts]].\n\nRonson was recruited to Midge Ure's band for Ure's Gift tour in 1985. After weeks of rehearsal, Ronson left the band due to financial disagreements and was replaced by Zal Cleminson.\n\nIn 1990, Ronson again collaborated with Hunter on the album ''[[YUI Orta]]'', this time getting joint credit, as \"Hunter/Ronson\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> One of the backing singers on the album was Carola Westerlund. While in Sweden Ronson wrote and produced three new songs with Estelle Millburne and Westerlund as EC2: \"I'm So Sorry\"/\"Kiss Me\" (1990), then a second single as ECII: \"Passion\" with a B-side cover of J. Kilette and K. Brown's \"[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]\".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 1993, he again appeared on a Bowie album, ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]'',<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> playing on the track \"[[I Feel Free]]\", originally recorded by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. Ronson and Bowie had already covered this track live 20 years earlier, whilst touring as Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. He also played lead guitar on the Morrissey-penned \"I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday\".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nHis second and third solo albums were ''[[Play Don't Worry]]'' in 1975, and ''[[Heaven and Hull]]'' in 1994.

His stage debut with The Mariners was in support of the Keith Herd Band at [[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]] Village Hall, a gig for which the band travelled 35 miles and got paid 10 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] (50p). While Ronson was working with The Mariners, another local Hull group \u2013 The Crestas \u2013 recruited him on the advice of The Mariners' bassist John Griffiths. With Ronson on board the Crestas gained a solid reputation, making regular appearances at local halls: Mondays at the Halfway House in Hull, Thursdays at the Ferryboat Hotel, Fridays at the Regal Ballroom in [[Beverley]], and Sundays at the Duke of Cumberland in [[North Ferriby]].\n\nIn 1965, Ronson left The Crestas, moving to London to seek work. He took a part-time job as a mechanic, and joined a band called The Voice, replacing Miller Anderson. Soon afterwards, Crestas' drummer Dave Bradfield travelled to London, replacing the Voice's previous drummer. After playing a few dates with the group, Ronson and Bradfield returned from a weekend in Hull to find their gear piled at their flat and a note explaining that the rest of the group had gone to The Bahamas. Ronson stayed in London and teamed up briefly with a soul band called The Wanted, before eventually returning to Hull. In 1966, he joined Hull's top local band, [[The Rats (British band)|The Rats]], joining singer Benny Marshall, bassist Geoff Appleby, and drummer Jim Simpson (who was subsequently replaced by Clive Taylor and then John Cambridge). The group played the local circuit, and made a few unsuccessful trips to London and Paris.<ref>[http://www.justabuzz.com/ga-0-bio.shtml\"Geoff Appleby - Biography\"], \"Just a Buzz\".</ref>\n\nIn 1967 The Rats recorded the one-off [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] track, \"The Rise and Fall of Bernie Gripplestone\"<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book|first=Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher= Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh, UK|pages=825\u201326|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> at [[Fairview Studios]] in [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] and can be heard on the 2008 release, ''Front Room Masters \u2013 Fairview Studios 1966\u20131973''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontroommasters.org|title=About the Project|publisher=Frontroom Masters|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> 1968 saw the band change their name briefly to Treacle and book another recording session at Fairview Studios in 1969, before reverting to their original name. Around this time, Ronson was recommended by [[Rick Kemp]] to play guitar on [[Michael Chapman (singer)|Michael Chapman]]'s ''Fully Qualified Survivor'' album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Keith 'Ched' Cheesman joined The Rats replacing Geoff Appleby on bass and the line up of Ronson, Marshall, Cheesman and Cambridge entered Fairview studio to record \"Guitar Boogie\", \"Stop and Get A Hold of Myself\" and \"Morning Dew\".\n \nWhen John Cambridge left The Rats to join his former [[The Hullaballoos|Hullaballoos]] bandmate Mick Wayne in Junior's Eyes, he was replaced by [[Mick Woodmansey|Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey]]. In November 1969, the band recorded a final session at Fairview, taping \"Telephone Blues\" and \"Early in Spring\".\n\nIn March 1970, during the recording sessions for [[Elton John]]'s album ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'', Ronson played guitar on the track \"[[Madman Across the Water]]\". This song, however, was not included in the original release. The recording featuring Ronson was released on the 1992 [[compilation album]], ''Rare Masters'', as well as the 1995 reissue and 2008 deluxe edition of ''Tumbleweed Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tumbleweed-connection-bonus-tracks-mw0000650322 |title=Tumbleweed Connection \u2013 Elton John : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=30 October 1970 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bowie era==\nEarly in 1970, John Cambridge came back to Hull in search of Ronson, intent upon recruiting him for a new [[David Bowie]] backing band called [[The Hype (David Bowie band)|The Hype]]. He found Ronson marking out a rugby pitch, one of his duties as a Parks Department gardener for [[Hull City Council]]. Having failed in his earlier attempts in London, Ronson was reluctant, but eventually agreed to accompany Cambridge to a meeting with Bowie. Two days later, on 5 February, Ronson made his debut with Bowie on [[John Peel]]'s national [[BBC Radio 1]] show.\n\nThe Hype played their first gig at [[The Roundhouse]] on 22 February with a line-up that included Bowie, Ronson, Cambridge, and producer/bassist [[Tony Visconti]]. The group dressed up in [[superhero]] costumes, with Bowie as Rainbowman, Visconti as Hypeman, Ronson as Gangsterman, and Cambridge as Cowboyman. Also on the bill that day were [[Bachdenkel]], [[The Groundhogs]] and [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]]. The following day they performed at the Streatham Arms in London under the pseudonym of 'Harry The Butcher'. They also performed on 28 February at the Basildon [[Arts Lab]] experimental music club at the [[Basildon]] Arts Centre in [[Essex]], billed as 'David Bowie's New Electric Band'. Also on the bill were [[High Tide (band)|High Tide]], Overson and [[Iron Butterfly]]. [[Strawbs]] were due to perform but were replaced by Bowie's New Electric Band. John Cambridge left in March, again replaced by [[Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Weird|Gilly|2009|p=55}} In April 1970, Ronson, Woodmansey, and Visconti started recording Bowie's ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' album.{{sfn|Weird|Gilly|2009|p=57}}\n\nDuring the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', the trio of Ronson, Visconti, and Woodmansey \u2013 still under The Hype moniker \u2013 signed to [[Vertigo Records]]. The group recruited Benny Marshall from The Rats as vocalist, and entered the studio to record an album. By the time a single appeared, The Hype had been renamed Ronno. \"4th Hour of My Sleep\" was released on Vertigo to an indifferent reception in January 1971.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song was written by Tucker Zimmerman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuckerzimmerman.org/discography |title=Discography |publisher=Tucker Zimmerman |accessdate=14 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021182828/http://www.tuckerzimmerman.org/discography |archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] was a Ronson/Marshall composition called \"Powers of Darkness\". The Ronno album was never completed.\n\nBowie's backing ensemble, which now included [[Trevor Bolder]], who had replaced Visconti on bass guitar, and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], were used in the recording of ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. The departure of Visconti also meant that Ronson, with Bowie, took over the arrangements, while [[Ken Scott]] co-produced with Bowie. ''Hunky Dory'' featured Ronson's string arrangements on several tracks, including \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life On Mars?]]\".{{sfn|Weird|Gilly|2009|p=68}}\n\nIt was this band, minus Wakeman, that became known as [[The Spiders from Mars]] from the title of the next Bowie album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Again, Ronson was a key part of ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', providing string arrangements and various instrumentation, as well as playing lead guitar. Ronson and Bowie achieved some notoriety over the concerts promoting this album, when Bowie would simulate [[Oral sex|fellatio]] on Ronson's guitar as he played. Ronson's guitar and arranging during the Spiders from Mars era provided much of the underpinning for later [[punk rock]] musicians.<ref>{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Taylor|year=2004|title=The A to X of Alternative Music|edition= 1st|publisher=Xfm|location= London, UK|isbn=0-8264-8217-1|page=45}}</ref> In 1972 Ronson provided a strings-and-brass arrangement for the song \"Sea Diver\" on the Bowie-produced ''[[All the Young Dudes (album)|All the Young Dudes]]'' album for [[Mott the Hoople]]. Ronson co-produced [[Lou Reed]]'s album ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' with Bowie, playing lead guitar and piano on the songs \"[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]\" and \"[[Satellite of Love]]\".

Ronson appeared on the 1972 [[country rock]] album ''[[Bustin' Out]]'' by [[Pure Prairie League]], where he undertook string ensemble arrangements and contributed guitar and vocals on several tracks, most notably \"Angel #9\", (which Ronson recorded for his second solo LP Play Don't Worry), string arrangements on \"Boulder Skies\" and \"Call Me, Tell Me\", and helped write and arrange \"Amie\".''\n\nHis guitar work was next heard on Bowie's ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and 1973 [[cover version|covers]] album ''[[Pin Ups (album)|Pin Ups]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pin-ups-mw0000034411/credits|title=Pin Ups \u2013 David Bowie: Credits|publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=1998|title=Guinness Rockopedia|edition=1st|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd.|location=London, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/57 57\u201358]|isbn=0-85112-072-5|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/57}}</ref> However, he was absent from the subsequent ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' album. In September 1983 he was a special guest at the Toronto leg of the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]], playing lead guitar during the performance of \"[[The Jean Genie]]\". He had only been asked to play the day before, and later recalled:\n{{quote|I was playing [[Earl Slick|[Earl] Slick]]'s guitar ... I had heard Slick play solos all night so I decided not to play solos and I just went out and thrashed the guitar. I ''really'' thrashed the guitar, I was waving the guitar above my head and all sorts of things. It was funny afterwards because David said, 'You should have seen [Earl Slick's] face...' meaning he looked petrified. I had his prize guitar and I was swinging it around my head and Slick's going 'Waaaa... watch my guitar', you know. I was banging into it and it was going round my head. Poor Slick.

In 1974, Ronson secured the No. 2 spot from a reader's poll in ''[[Creem]]'' magazine as the best guitarist that year (with [[Jimmy Page]] taking first place), and [[Eric Clapton]] in third place after Ronson.<ref name=\"''Creem'' magazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/creem_lists.htm|title=CREEM MAGAZINE 1974 READER POLL RESULTS|date=1995\u20132010|publisher=Concept Copyright Julian White|accessdate=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nRonson contributed guitar to the title track of the 1976 [[David Cassidy]] release ''[[Getting It in the Street]]''. On 11 February 1977 the single \"Billy Porter\" (b/w \"Seven Days\") was released on RCA Victor Records, but did not chart. [[Roger Daltrey]] employed Ronson's guitar on his 1977 solo release ''[[One of the Boys (Roger Daltrey album)|One of the Boys]]''. In 1979, Ronson and Hunter produced and played on the [[Ellen Foley]] debut album, ''[[Night Out (album)|Night Out]]'', with \"We Belong to the Night\" and the hit single \"What's a Matter Baby\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 1982, Ronson worked with [[John Mellencamp]] on his ''[[American Fool]]'' album, and in particular the song \"[[Jack & Diane]]\": <blockquote>\"I owe Mick Ronson the hit song 'Jack & Diane'. Mick was very instrumental in helping me arrange that song, as I'd thrown it on the junk heap. Ronson came down and played on three or four tracks and worked on the American Fool record for four or five weeks. All of a sudden, for 'Jack & Diane', Mick said 'Johnny, you should put baby rattles on there.' I thought, 'What the fuck does put baby rattles on the record mean? So he put the percussion on there and then he sang the part 'let it rock, let it roll' as a choir-ish-type thing, which had never occurred to me. And that is the part everybody remembers on the song. It was Ronson's idea.\" (John Mellencamp, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, January 2008, p.61)</blockquote> Both \"Jack & Diane\" and ''American Fool'' topped their respective US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[record chart|charts]].\n\nRonson was recruited to Midge Ure's band for Ure's Gift tour in 1985. After weeks of rehearsal, Ronson left the band due to financial disagreements and was replaced by Zal Cleminson.\n\nIn 1990, Ronson again collaborated with Hunter on the album ''[[YUI Orta]]'', this time getting joint credit, as \"Hunter/Ronson\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> One of the backing singers on the album was Carola Westerlund. While in Sweden Ronson wrote and produced three new songs with Estelle Millburne and Westerlund as EC2: \"I'm So Sorry\"/\"Kiss Me\" (1990), then a second single as ECII: \"Passion\" with a B-side cover of J.

Ronson and Bowie had already covered this track live 20 years earlier, whilst touring as Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. He also played lead guitar on the Morrissey-penned \"I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday\".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nHis second and third solo albums were ''[[Play Don't Worry]]'' in 1975, and ''[[Heaven and Hull]]'' in 1994.

Artists involved with the album included Bowie, John Mellencamp, [[Joe Elliott]], Ian Hunter, [[Chrissie Hynde]], and [[Martin Chambers]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nBesides Bowie and Hunter, Ronson went on to work as a musician, songwriter and record producer with many other acts. He did not restrict his influence behind the recording desk to just established acts. His production work appears on albums by more obscure artists, such as [[Payolas]], Phil Rambow and [[Los Illegals]], [[The Mundanes]] and Italian band [[Mod\u00e0|Moda]]. Ronson produced The Visible Targets, a [[Seattle, Washington]]-based group, on their 1983 five track [[Extended play|EP]], \"Autistic Savant\".

Her calculations led to predictions for the location of the unknown planet, but Lowell died in 1916 meaning that the project was discontinued. In the late 1920s the project was resumed and [[Clyde Tombaugh]] was hired to lead it.

He decided to strike out on his own before the group recorded their second album, and in 1990, he released his first LP with [[The Dogs (US hip-hop band)|The Dogs]] - a group he co-founded on Joeyboy Records. This self-titled debut launched the hits \"Crack Rock\" and \"Take It Off,\" and was followed up in 1991 with the highly successful ''Beware of the Dogs'' album. This LP added hits like \"Nasty Dance\" and \"Get Down\" to the group's repertoire, and comparisons to [[2 Live Crew]] were often made of The Dogs among [[Miami bass]] and [[dirty rap]] fans.\n\nRick soon decided to strike out on a solo career, toying with the notion on his 1991 release, ''The Negro's Back''. While tracks on the LP did feature The Dogs, and its 12\" singles did gain club notoriety, it wasn't until 1992 that Disco Rick officially split from the group and signed with Luke Records. There he released the album ''Back from Hell'' as Disco Rick and the Wolf Pack, and scored a hit with the song \"Wiggle Wiggle.\"\n\n1992 proved the end of the line for the recording careers of not only Disco Rick, but The Dogs as well. The latter's final LP, ''K-9 Bass'', was released later that year without Disco Rick, and neither the group nor its onetime leader could gain the momentum apart that they had once had as a cohesive unit.\n\nRick soon turned his attention to production, going on to assist in the recording careers of artists such as [[Bone Thugs N Harmony]], (Krayzie 'Bone, Bizzyie Bone), [[Ice-T]], [[Fat Joe]], and many others. Rick gave [[Lil Jon]] a brand new MPC-3000 beat player in 1996 and showed Lil Jon how to work it before leaving [[Atlanta]] to go back home to Miami to work with Bone Thugs. Shortly thereafter, Rick received a call from Lil Jon inviting him to come and work with him on the [[Kings of Crunk]] album.\n\nDisco Rick has gained a lot of respect over the years in the South with regional artists like [[Trick Daddy]], [[Dirtbag (rapper)|Dirtbag]], [[Pretty Ricky]] and more. Local radio stations in [[Miami]] keep a close lookout for Rick because he has a knack for bringing local talent to the national spotlight. Disco Rick is also one of the biggest club promoters in Miami, and that gives him access to DJs throughout the city. Rick's studio talents range from writing, producing, recording and mixing, to operations manager for Audio Vision Studios, where he currently spends his time managing and producing for Vision Records, the sister company of AVS.\n\nhttp://www.audiovisionstudios.com/rick.htm\n\n==Discography==\n\n===The Dogs: \"The Dogs\"===\nJoeyBoy Records - JR 2003<br>\nReleased March 28, 1990<br>\n1.

During that time, both the Navajo and the Americans feared that the other side would launch a campaign of reprisal. As result, Flagstaff was fortified by the town [[militia]].<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/><ref name=\"hkhinc.com\"/>\n\nEventually, the hunters who were involved in the fight were told to report to Flagstaff for a hearing in court, which they refused to do at first. Instead, Chief B'ugoettin assembled 300 heavily armed warriors and led them to Flagstaff. His plan was to conceal his force in the woods outside of town and then go in unarmed with two men to return the posse's horses, attacking only if they were placed in jail. Fortunately, however, [[Reverend]] William R. Johnston helped defuse the situation and he promised B'ugoettin that the three hunters would receive an adequate defense if they surrendered now. B'ugoettin agreed so the attack on Flagstaff never came.<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/>\n\nThe trial was held in the Coconino County Courthouse in September 1900, during which, the wounded Navajo hunter, Haastiin Biwoo Adin, impressed [[Judge]] [[Richard E. Sloan]] with his address so much so that he found all three of the hunters innocent. Reverend Johnston's nine-year-old son, [[Philip Johnston (code talker)|Philip]], translated the Navajo's speech for the court.<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/><ref name=\"Iverson, pg. 71-76\"/>\n\nAfter the trial, a Navajo delegation was sent to [[Washington, D. C.]] to petition the government for the creation of the Leupp Extension. Ultimately, the delegation was successful in convincing [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who issued his executive order on November 14, 1901. The Leupp Extension was named after Roosevelt's commissioner of Indian affairs, [[Bureau of Indian Affairs#Commissioners and Assistant Secretaries|Francis E. Leupp]], and it led to the founding of the town [[Leupp, Arizona|Leupp]]. Also, B'ugoettin rewarded Reverend Johnston by permitting him to build a [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] at Tolchaco, which was located about seven miles south of Leupp.<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Combat incidents]]\n[[Category:History of Coconino County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Navajo history]]\n[[Category:1899 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:1900 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:1901 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1899]]\n[[Category:American frontier]]\n[[Category:November 1899 events]]\n[[Category:Flagstaff, Arizona]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox historical event\n  |Event_Name     = Padre Canyon Incident\n  |Image_Name     = \n  |Imagesize      = \n  |Image_Alt      = \n  |Image_Caption  = \n  |Thumb_Time     = \n  |AKA            = \n  |Participants   = \n  |Location       = Near [[Leupp, Arizona|Leupp]], [[Arizona]], [[United States]]\n  |Date           = November 11, 1899\n  |nongregorian   = \n  |Deaths        = 3\n  |Result         = \n  |URL            = \n}}\n{{Navajo Wars}}\n{{Campaignbox American Indian Wars (1898\u20131918)}}\n\nThe '''Padre Canyon incident''' was a skirmish in November 1899 between a group of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] hunters and a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of [[Arizona]] lawmen.

During that time, both the Navajo and the Americans feared that the other side would launch a campaign of reprisal. As result, Flagstaff was fortified by the town [[militia]].<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/><ref name=\"hkhinc.com\"/>\n\nEventually, the hunters who were involved in the fight were told to report to Flagstaff for a hearing in court, which they refused to do at first. Instead, Chief B'ugoettin assembled 300 heavily armed warriors and led them to Flagstaff. His plan was to conceal his force in the woods outside of town and then go in unarmed with two men to return the posse's horses, attacking only if they were placed in jail. Fortunately, however, [[Reverend]] William R. Johnston helped defuse the situation and he promised B'ugoettin that the three hunters would receive an adequate defense if they surrendered now. B'ugoettin agreed so the attack on Flagstaff never came.<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/>\n\nThe trial was held in the Coconino County Courthouse in September 1900, during which, the wounded Navajo hunter, Haastiin Biwoo Adin, impressed [[Judge]] [[Richard E. Sloan]] with his address so much so that he found all three of the hunters innocent. Reverend Johnston's nine-year-old son, [[Philip Johnston (code talker)|Philip]], translated the Navajo's speech for the court.<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/><ref name=\"Iverson, pg. 71-76\"/>\n\nAfter the trial, a Navajo delegation was sent to [[Washington, D. C.]] to petition the government for the creation of the Leupp Extension. Ultimately, the delegation was successful in convincing [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who issued his executive order on November 14, 1901. The Leupp Extension was named after Roosevelt's commissioner of Indian affairs, [[Bureau of Indian Affairs#Commissioners and Assistant Secretaries|Francis E. Leupp]], and it led to the founding of the town [[Leupp, Arizona|Leupp]]. Also, B'ugoettin rewarded Reverend Johnston by permitting him to build a [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] at Tolchaco, which was located about seven miles south of Leupp.<ref name=\"azdailysun.com\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Combat incidents]]\n[[Category:History of Coconino County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Navajo history]]\n[[Category:1899 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:1900 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:1901 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1899]]\n[[Category:American frontier]]\n[[Category:November 1899 events]]\n[[Category:Flagstaff, Arizona]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFlagstaff(link changed toFlagstaff, Arizona) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padre_Canyon_incident"}

This is sometimes called [[constitutional carry]]. Within the unrestricted category, there exists states that are ''fully unrestricted,'' where no permit is required for lawful open or concealed carry, and ''partially unrestricted,'' where certain forms of concealed carry may be legal without a permit, while other forms of carry may require a permit.\n\nAmong U.S. states, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky (effective June 26, 2019), Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota (residents only; concealed carry only), Oklahoma (effective Nov. 1, 2019), South Dakota (effective July 1, 2019), Vermont, West Virginia<ref name=\"theintelligencer.net\"/> and Wyoming (residents only) are fully unrestricted, and allow those who are not prohibited from owning a firearm to carry a concealed firearm in any place not deemed off-limits by law without a permit. North Dakota and Wyoming only extend permitless carry to residents of the state; non-residents must still have a permit issued by their home state to legally carry concealed in these states. Permitless concealed carry in Mississippi only covers certain manners of carrying; see table above. These states also allow the [[open carry]] of a handgun without a permit with the exception of North Dakota and certain localities in Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dps.state.ak.us/statewide/permitslicensing/concealedhandguns.aspx |title=Alaska Concealed Handgun Permits&nbsp;\u2013 Permits and Licensing Unit |publisher=Dps.state.ak.us|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullchapter.cfm?Title=13&Chapter=085 |title=The Vermont Statutes Online |publisher=Leg.state.vt.us|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref><ref name=\"thewyonews.net\">{{cite web|url=http://thewyonews.net/2011/03/02/gov-mead-signs-bill-allowing-concealed-carry-without-a-permit/ |title=Governor Mead Signs Bill Allowed Concealed-Carry Without a Permit |publisher=thewyonews.net|accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305170737/http://thewyonews.net/2011/03/02/gov-mead-signs-bill-allowing-concealed-carry-without-a-permit/ |archivedate=March 5, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://concealednation.org/2015/07/maine-governor-to-sign-law-today-that-will-eliminate-the-requirement-for-permit-to-carry-concealed/ |title=Maine Governor To Sign Law Today That Will Eliminate The Requirement For Permit To Carry Concealed |date=2015-07-08 |publisher=concealednation.org|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_127th/billtexts/SP024501.asp |title=An Act To Authorize the Carrying of Concealed Handguns without a Permit |publisher=state.me.us|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>\n\nVermont does not have any provision for issue of concealed-carry licenses, as none has ever been necessary. As such, Vermont residents wishing to carry handguns in other states must acquire a license from a state which is valid in their destination. A popular choice is Florida's concealed handgun permit, which is valid for nonresident holders in 28 other states. All other [[constitutional carry]] states previously had concealed-carry license requirements prior to adoption of unrestricted carry laws, and continue to issue licenses on a shall-issue basis for the purposes of inter-state reciprocity (allowing residents of the state to travel to other states with a concealed weapon, abiding by that state's law).\n\nThe states of Montana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma are partially unrestricted states. Specifically, Montana currently allows concealed carry without a permit in places outside of any incorporated municipality. [[New Mexico]] laws allow an individual to conceal carry an unloaded handgun without a permit. New Mexico further allows one to carry a loaded handgun either openly or concealed while traveling in a vehicle, including motorcycles, recreational vehicles (RVs), bicycles or while riding a horse. Oklahoma allows residents of permitless carry states to carry openly or concealed without a permit, provided such individuals have a valid ID from their home state. All of the aforementioned states grant permits on a shall-issue basis for modes of concealed carry that require a permit.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, Washington D.C. became a constitutional carry jurisdiction for a brief moment when its ban on carrying a handgun was ruled unconstitutional and the ruling was not stayed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Palmer-v.-District-of-Columbia_Memorandum-Decision-and-Order-re-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Summary-Judgment-and-Defendants-Cross-Motion-for-Summary-Judgment.pdf|title=Palmer v.

The laws in a Shall-Issue jurisdiction typically state that a granting authority ''shall issue'' a license if the criteria are met, as opposed to laws in which the authority ''may issue'' a license at their discretion.\n\nTypical license requirements include residency, minimum age, submitting fingerprints, passing a computerized instant background check (or a more comprehensive manual background check), attending a certified handgun/firearm safety class, passing a practical qualification demonstrating handgun proficiency, and paying a required fee. These requirements vary widely by jurisdiction, with some having few or none of these and others having most or all.\n\nThe following are shall-issue states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina,<ref name=\"NC_SI_law\"/> North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,<ref name=\"OR_SI_law\"/> Pennsylvania, Rhode Island (for permits issued by local authorities), South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,<ref name=\"TN_SI_law\"/> Texas,<ref name=\"TX_CHL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/CHL/index.htm |title=Concealed Handgun Licensing Program |publisher=[[Texas Department of Public Safety]] |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614194349/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/rsd/chl/index.htm |archive-date=2013-06-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"TX_SI_law\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.411.htm#411.172 |title=Texas Government Code, Chapter 411, Subchapter H.

[[Connecticut]], and certain cities and counties in [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York State|New York]] are examples.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nConnecticut law specifies that CCW licenses be granted on a may-issue basis, but the state's courts have established that issuing authorities must grant CCW licenses on a shall-issue basis for applicants who meet all statutory qualifications, as unlike other may-issue states Connecticut law does not contain a requirement for the applicant to show \"necessary and proper reason\" for obtaining a license.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n''Shall-issue with limited discretion'' is a subset of shall-issue licensing that borders between pure shall-issue and may-issue policy, where an issuing authority has a limited degree of discretion to deny applicants a concealed carry permit based either on the applicant's suitability or reason for requesting a permit, even after the applicant has completed any required training and passed a background check. In states with such licensing practices, the issuing authority would be required to demonstrate with substantiating evidence, that the applicant is either not suitable or lacks appropriate need for the permit. Most denials in such states are typically reversed upon appeal provided the applicant has passed a background check and fulfilled any training requirements for the permit. States with shall-issue laws that allow a limited degree of discretion include [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. Although may-issue by statute, [[Connecticut]] also falls into this subset, in practice.\n\nSome shall-issue jurisdictions allow for automatic renewal of concealed carry permits, as long as the permit-holder files the renewal application before the permit expires (or in some states, a short grace period following expiration of the original permit). Other jurisdictions require a permit-holder to complete refresher training in firearms safety and undergo a criminal background check before applying for renewal. Some jurisdictions periodically run permit holders' IDs through the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|NICS]] background check system. Other jurisdictions require a judge to suspend a permit if the holder is arrested for certain offenses (return/revocation of the permit depending on later disposition of the case).\n\n====May-issue====\nA '''may-issue''' jurisdiction is one that requires a [[License|permit]] to carry a concealed handgun, and where the granting of such permits is partially at the discretion of local authorities (frequently the [[sheriff's department]] or [[police]]), with a few states consolidating this discretionary power under state-level law enforcement. Moreover, issuing authorities in most may-issue jurisdictions are not required to provide a substantive reason for the denial of a concealed carry permit. Some may-issue jurisdictions may provide administrative and legal avenues for an applicant to appeal a permit denial, while others do not.\n\nThe law typically states that a granting authority \"may issue\" a permit if various criteria are met, or that the permit applicant must have \"good cause\" (or similar) to carry a concealed weapon. In most such situations, self-defense in and of itself often does not satisfy the \"good cause\" requirement, and issuing authorities in some may-issue jurisdictions have been known to arbitrarily deny applications for CCW permits without providing the applicant with any substantive reason for the denial. Some may-issue jurisdictions require a permit-holder to provide justification for continued need for a concealed carry permit upon renewal, and may deny the renewal of an expiring permit without sufficient showing of \"good cause.\" Some of these jurisdictions may revoke a permit after it has been issued when the issuing authority in its discretion has determined that the \"good cause\" used in approving the permit application no longer exists. Other may-issue jurisdictions allow for automatic renewal of the permit, as long as the permit-holder completes any required firearms safety training and files the renewal application before the permit expires. Some may-issue jurisdictions give issuing authorities discretion in granting concealed carry permits based on an applicant's suitability (e.g., moral character) by requiring the applicant to submit evidence (resume/curriculum vitae, letters of reference, credit history, etc.) showing the applicant is of suitable character to be issued a permit.\n\nWhen distinguishing between shall-issue and may-issue, that distinction may not necessarily be explicitly apparent in the exact letter of the law. Rather, a more accurate determinant as to whether a state is shall-issue versus may-issue is whether or not the applicant is required to show \"good cause\" when applying for a permit. Court precedent also plays an important role in determining whether a state is may-issue or shall-issue without regard to the verbiage in state law. For example, New York is a may-issue state, even though its concealed carry licensing laws includes the words \"shall issue,\" because New York law requires applicants to show \"good cause\" when applying for a concealed carry permit. Since \"good cause\" is highly subjective, issuing authorities in New York have wide discretion in determining what constitutes \"good cause,\" and the ability for an ordinary citizen to obtain a concealed carry permit varies widely throughout the state. In contrast, the pistol permit law in neighboring Connecticut contains the words \"may issue,\" despite Connecticut effectively being a shall-issue state. This is because Connecticut's pistol permit law does not require the applicant to show \"good cause\" to the issuing authority when applying for a pistol permit. Because Connecticut's permitting law lacks a subjective \"good cause\" standard, that state's courts have repeatedly and consistently ruled that issuing authorities must issue pistol permits to applicants who meet the state's statutory qualifications for a pistol permit.\n\nMay-issue can be compared to shall-issue where in a may-issue jurisdiction, the burden of proof for justifying the need for a permit rests with the applicant, whereas in a shall-issue jurisdiction the burden of proof to justify denying a permit rests with the issuing authority.\n\nThe following are may-issue states by law: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Rhode Island]].\n\nA state that is ''[[de jure]]'' a may-issue jurisdiction may range anywhere from shall-issue to no-issue in practice,<ref name=\"i2i-shall-issue\">{{cite web |url= http://www.i2i.org/main/article.php?article_id=643&print=1 |title= &thinsp;'Shall Issue': The New Wave of Concealed Handgun Permit Laws |accessdate= 2008-04-13 |author= Clayton E.

Additionally Maryland and New Jersey require the applicant provide substantive evidence of a clear and immediate threat on their lives that exists outside of their home at the time the permit application is filed. Rhode Island further requires applicants for the statewide permit to submit to a mental health records check at the applicant's expense.\n* [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] vary within state, as the criteria for what constitutes \"good cause\" is defined at the local level. Issuing authorities in inland California, rural portions of Massachusetts, and [[Upstate New York]] generally accept self-defense without evidence of a specific threat as \"good cause\" and will grant permits to the vast majority of applicants who pass a background check and complete the required firearms safety training. Meanwhile, concealed carry permits are difficult to virtually impossible to obtain by ordinary citizens in urban areas, such as [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[San Francisco]] metropolitan areas. In these locations, the definition of \"good cause\" is generally limited to specific and immediate threats on an applicant's life that cannot be mitigated by any other means. There are also \"moderately restrictive\" local jurisdictions in these states where the local \"good cause\" definitions may be more restrictive than locales that practice shall-issue licensing, but less restrictive than those counties or municipalities that rarely or never issue permits.\n* [[Rhode Island]] state law is two-tier; local authorities are directed by state law and court precedent (''Archer v McGarry'') to practice shall-issue permitting policy, but the Attorney General's office has discretionary authority over permits issued by its office. The permits issued by both the local authorities and the AG are valid statewide, but the AG issued permit is required for open carry in general. Some local jurisdictions, at the recommendation of the AG, still refer all applicants to the AG's office and the \"may-issue\" state-level system in violation of ''Archer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usacarry.com/rhode_island_concealed_carry_permit_information.html|title=Rhode Island Concealed Carry Permit Information|website=USA Carry}}</ref>\n\nIn some may-issue jurisdictions, permits are only issued to individuals with celebrity status, have political connections, or have a high degree of wealth,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-284.html | title=Fighting Back: Crime, Self-Defense, and the Right to Carry a Handgun | publisher=Cato Institute | accessdate=January 3, 2012 | author=Snyder, Jeffrey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/madoff_son_of_gun_LDcUvEw9PXY0rS1oNFfl1J | title=Madoff son of a gun Bernie kid on pistol-permit list | publisher=NY Post | accessdate=January 3, 2012| date=2009-12-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/nyregion/20guns.html | title=The Rich, the Famous, the Armed | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 18, 2011 |author=Jo Craven McGinty | accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> resulting in accusations of systematic corruption in how CCW permit applications are adjudicated in some such jurisdictions.<ref>http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/21/fox-business-john-stossel-tried-to-get-a-new-york-gun-permitit-turned-out-poorly-n2151874 Fox Business\u2019 John Stossel Tried To Get A New York Gun Permit \u2013 It Turned Out Poorly townhall.com April 21, 2016.</ref> Additionally, issuing authorities charge arbitrarily defined fees that go well beyond the basic processing fee for a CCW permit, thereby making the CCW permit unaffordable to most applicants. For example, applying for a New York City concealed carry permit typically costs around $5,000 when the filing fee and other administrative fees are combined.\n\nIn recent cases challenging restrictive discretionary issue laws, federal district and appeals courts have generally applied [[intermediate scrutiny]] to these and other Second Amendment related cases, where the courts recognize that restrictive concealed carry laws \"infringe on an individual's right to keep and bear arms,\" but also recognizes that such infringement is permitted to further \"an important government interest in public safety.\" Any and all other Rights that are described as \"individual\" and \"fundamental\" by the SCOTUS require a \"strict scrutiny\" standard as shown in prior decisions involving fully applicable incorporation cases. In Maryland, ''[[Woollard v. Sheridan]]'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]] decided in favor of a Maryland resident who was denied a permit renewal due to lack of \"good cause\" in accordance with Maryland law.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Woollard v.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] affirmed the lower court's judgment holding the requirement constitutional, holding (much like the 4th Circuit in ''Woollard'' and the 2nd Circuit in ''Kachalsky'') that the New Jersey statute survived [[intermediate scrutiny]].<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Drake v.

The courts have opined that these laws survive intermediate scrutiny on that basis. However, all other \"fundamental\" and \"individual\" Rights are subjected to a \"strict scrutiny\" standard, see, Duncan, 391 U.S. at 149, and n. 15, supra., \"A right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States.\"\n\n====Concealed carry on U.S. military installations====\nWhile members of the Armed Services may receive extensive small arms training, [[United States Military]] installations have some of the most restrictive rules for the possession, transport, and carrying of personally-owned firearms in the country.\n\nOverall authority for carrying a personally-owned firearm on a military installation rests with the installation commander, although the authority to permit individuals to carry firearms on an installation is usually delegated to the [[Provost Marshal]]. Military installations do not recognize state-issued concealed carry permits, and state firearms laws generally do not apply to military bases, regardless of the state in which the installation is located. Federal law (18 USC, Section 930) generally forbids the possession, transport, and carrying of firearms on military installations without approval from the installation commander. Federal law gives installation commanders wide discretion in establishing firearms policies for their respective installations. In practice, local discretion is often constrained by policies and directives from the headquarters of each military branch and major commands.\n\nInstallation policies can vary from no-issue for most bases to shall-issue in rare circumstances. Installations that do allow the carrying of firearms typically restrict carrying to designated areas and for specific purposes (i.e., hunting or officially sanctioned shooting competitions in approved locations on the installation). Installation commanders may require the applicant complete extensive firearms safety training, undergo a mental health evaluation, and obtain a letter of recommendation from his or her unit commander (or employer) before such authorization is granted. Personnel that reside on a military installation are typically required to store their personally-owned firearms in the installation armory, although the installation commander or provost marshal may permit a servicemember to store his or her personal firearms in their on-base dwelling if he or she has a [[gun safe]] or similarly designed cabinet where the firearms can be secured.\n\nPrior to 2011, military commanders could impose firearms restrictions to servicemembers residing off-base, such as mandatory registration of firearms with the base Provost Marshal, restricting or banning the carrying of firearms by servicemembers either on or off the installation regardless of whether the member had a state permit to carry, and requiring servicemembers to have a gun safe or similar container to secure firearms when not in use. A provision was included in the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011]] that limited commanders' authority to impose restrictions on the possession and use of personally-owned firearms by servicemembers who reside off-base.\n\n====No-issue====\nA '''no-issue''' jurisdiction is one that&nbsp;\u2013 with very limited exceptions&nbsp;\u2013 does not allow any private citizen to carry a concealed handgun in public. The term refers to the fact that no concealed carry permits will be issued (or recognized). Since July 2013, with the legalization of concealed carry in Illinois, there are presently no no-issue states ''per se''; with only the territory of American Samoa being the only U.S. jurisdiction that completely prohibits concealed carry.\n\nWhile technically may-issue under state law, [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and certain cities and counties within [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] are no-issue jurisdictions in practice, with governmental policy directing officials with discretionary power to rarely or never issue licenses. Additionally, some of the United States' insular territories ([[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], etc.) are no-issue jurisdictions in practice. Most no-issue jurisdictions have exceptions to their laws that permit open or concealed carry by active and retired law enforcement officials, armed security personnel while on duty and in uniform, and for members of the Armed Forces. Wisconsin and Illinois were the last remaining no-issue states, until licensed concealed carry was legalized in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Prior to legalization, Wisconsin outlawed concealed carry, but open carry was legal statewide. Illinois had banned concealed carry, and generally prohibited open carry in most locations as well.\n\n====Limitations on concealed carry====\n\nProhibitions of the concealed carry of firearms and other weapons by local governments predate the establishment of the United States. In 1686, New Jersey law stated \u201cno person or persons \u2026 shall presume privately to wear any pocket pistol \u2026 or other unusual or unlawful weapons within this Province.\u201d  After the federal government was established, states and localities continued to restrict people from carrying hidden weapons. Tennessee law prohibited this as early as 1821. By 1837, Georgia passed into effect \u201cAn Act to guard and protect the citizens of this State, against the unwarrantable and too prevalent use of deadly weapons.\u201d Two years later, Alabama followed suit with \u201cAn Act to Suppress the Evil Practice of Carrying Weapons Secretly.\u201d Delaware prohibited the practice in 1852.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Robert J.|first1=Spitzer|title=Even in the Wild West, there were rules about carrying concealed weapons|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-spitzer-peruta-concealed-carry-20160619-snap-story.html|accessdate=21 June 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=19 June 2016}}</ref> Ohio did the same in 1859, a policy that remained in effect until 1974.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Joe|first1=Eaton|last2=Chad D.|first2=Baus|title=Ohio Gun Rights Timeline|url=http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/ohio-gun-rights-timeline-journey-towards-freedom|website=Buckeye Firearms Association|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Cities also regulated weapons within their boundaries. In 1881, [[Tombstone, Arizona]] enacted Ordinance No. 9 \"To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons,\" a regulation that sparked the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] later that year.\n\nMost may-issue jurisdictions, and some shall-issue jurisdictions allow issuing authorities to impose limitations on CCW permits, such as the type and caliber of handguns that may be carried ([[Massachusetts]], [[New Mexico]]), restrictions on places where the permit is valid ([[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Illinois]]), restricting concealed carry to purposes or activities specified on the approved permit application ([[California]], Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York), limitations on magazine size ([[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], New York), or limitations on the number of firearms that may be carried concealed by a permit-holder at any given time (some states). Permits issued by all but two states (New York and Hawaii) are valid statewide. New York State pistol licenses, which are generally issued by counties, are valid statewide with one exception. A permit not issued by New York City is invalid in that city, unless validated by its police commissioner.<ref name=\"New York State License Validity\">[http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article400.htm#p400.00 N.Y.

Certain training courses developed by the [[National Rifle Association]] that combine classroom and live-fire instruction typically meet most state training requirements. Some states recognize prior military or police service as meeting training requirements.<ref name=\"vsp.state.va.us\">[http://www.vsp.state.va.us/Firearms_ResidentConcealed.shtm#ApplicationforaConcealedHandgunPermit Virginia State Police, application for a concealed handgun permit page]. Vsp.state.va.us. Retrieved on 2011-10-16.</ref>\n\nClassroom instruction would typically include [[firearm]] mechanics and terminology, cleaning and maintenance of a firearm, concealed carry legislation and limitations, liability issues, carry methods and safety, home defense, methods for managing and defusing confrontational situations, and practice of gun handling techniques without firing the weapon. Most required CCW training courses devote a considerable amount of time to liability issues.\n\nDepending on the state, a practical component during which the attendee shoots the weapon for the purpose of demonstrating safety and proficiency, may be required. During range instruction, applicants would typically learn and demonstrate safe handling and operation of a firearm and accurate shooting from common self-defense distances. Some states require a certain proficiency to receive a passing grade, whereas other states (e.g., Florida) technically require only a single-shot be fired to demonstrate handgun handling proficiency.\n\nCCW training courses are typically completed in a single day and are good for a set period, the exact duration varying by state. Some states require re-training, sometimes in a shorter, simpler format, for each renewal.\n\nA few states, e.g., South Carolina, recognize the safety and use-of-force training given to military personnel as acceptable in lieu of formal civilian training certification. Such states will ask for a [[United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card|military ID]] (South Carolina) for active persons or [[DD214]] for honorably discharged persons. These few states will commonly request a copy of the applicant's BTR (Basic Training Record) proving an up-to-date pistol qualification. Active and retired law enforcement officers are generally exempt from qualification requirements, due to a federal statute permitting retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flsenate.gov/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=Ch0790/ch0790.htm |title=Florida Statute 790}}</ref>\n\nVirginia recognizes eight specific training options to prove competency in handgun handling, ranging from DD214 for honorably discharged military veterans, to certification from law enforcement training, to firearms training conducted by a state or NRA certified firearms instructor including electronic, video, or on-line courses. While any one of the eight listed options will be considered adequate proof, individual circuit courts may recognize other training options.<ref name=\"vsp.state.va.us\"/> A small number of states, such as Alabama and Georgia, have no training requirements to obtain a permit\u2014only a requirement that the applicant successfully pass the required background check before issuance.\n\n===Reciprocity===\n[[File:Permit reciprocity.svg|thumb|300x300px|<p>Level of permit reciprocity (recognition of out-of-state permits)<ref name=\"handgunlaw.us\"/><ref>http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/USStatesThatHonorMyPermit.pdf</ref></p>{{legend|#008000|Full reciprocity}}{{legend|#00cd00|Full reciprocity for resident permits}}{{legend|#0000FF|Vehicle carry only}}{{legend|#FFA500|Partial reciprocity}}{{legend|#FF0000|No reciprocity}}]]\n[[File:CCW reciprocity.png|CCW reciprocity|thumb|400x400px|<p>CCW Reciprocity</p>]]\n<!--Outdated and inaccurate image[[File:CCW Recognition.jpg|thumb|500px|Concealed Carry recognition by State]]-->\nMany jurisdictions recognize (honor) a permit or license issued by other jurisdictions. Recognition may be granted to all jurisdictions or some subset which meets a set of permit-issuing criteria, such as training comparable to the honoring jurisdiction or certain background checks. Several states have entered into formal agreements to mutually recognize permits. This arrangement is commonly called reciprocity or mutual recognition. A few states do not recognize permits issued by any other jurisdiction, but offer non-resident permits for out-of-state individuals (who possess a valid concealed carry permit from their home state) who wish to carry while visiting such states. There are also states that neither recognize out-of-state concealed carry permits nor issue permits to non-residents, resulting in a complete ban on concealed carry by non-residents in such states.  There are also states that do not recognize out-of-state permits for carry on-foot, but do permit individuals with out-of-state concealed carry permits to carry while traveling in their vehicle (normally in accordance with the rules of the state of issuance).\n\nRecognition and reciprocity of concealed carry privileges varies. Some states (e.g. Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio) unilaterally recognize all permits. Others such as Michigan, limit such universal recognition to residents of the permit-issuing state.<ref name=\"usacarry.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usacarry.com/concealed_carry_permit_information.html |title=''Concealed Carry (CCW) Laws by State'' on |publisher=Usacarry.com|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> While 37&nbsp;states have reciprocity agreements with at least one other state and several states honor all out-of-state concealed carry permits, some states have special requirements like training courses or safety exams, and therefore do not honor permits from states that do not have such requirements for issue. Some states make exceptions for persons under the minimum age (usually 21) if they are active or honorably-discharged members of the military or a police force (the second of these two is allowed under federal law). States that do not have this exemption generally do not recognize any license from states that do. An example of this is the state of Washington's refusal to honor any Texas&nbsp;LTC as Texas has the military exception to age.<ref>[http://www.atg.wa.gov/page.aspx?id=7772 State of Washington reciprocity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606120455/http://www.atg.wa.gov/page.aspx?id=7772 |date=2011-06-06 }}.

These areas vary by state (except for the first item below; federal offices are subject to superseding federal law) and can include:\n* '''Federal government facilities''', including post offices, IRS offices, federal court buildings, military/VA facilities and/or correctional facilities, Amtrak trains and facilities, and Corps of Engineers-controlled property (carry in these places is prohibited by federal law and preempts any existing state law). Carry on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (federal parks and wildlife preserves) is allowed by federal law as of the 2009 CARD Act, but is still subject to state law. However, carry into restrooms or any other buildings or structures located within federal parks is illegal in the United States, despite concealed carry being otherwise legal in federal parks with a permit recognized by the state in which the federal park is located. Similarly, concealed carry into caves located within federal parks is illegal.\n* '''State and local government facilities''', including courthouses, DMV/DoT offices, police stations, correctional facilities, and/or meeting places of government entities (exceptions may be made for certain persons working in these facilities such as judges, lawyers, and certain government officials both elected and appointed)\n* '''Venues for political events''', including rallies, parades, debates, and/or polling places\n* '''Educational institutions''' including elementary/secondary schools and colleges. Some states have \"drop-off exceptions\" which only prohibit carry inside school buildings, or permit carry while inside a personal vehicle on school property. [[Campus carry in the United States|Campus carry]] laws vary by state.\n* '''Public interscholastic{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and/or professional sporting events''' and/or venues (sometimes only during a time window surrounding such an event)\n* '''Amusement parks, fairs, parades and/or carnivals'''{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n* '''Businesses that sell alcohol''' (sometimes only \"by-the-drink\" sellers like restaurants, sometimes only establishments defined as a \"bar\" or \"nightclub\", or establishments where the percentage of total sales from alcoholic beverages exceeds a specified threshold)\n* '''Hospitals''' (even if hospitals themselves are not restricted, \"teaching hospitals\" partnered with a medical school are sometimes considered \"educational institutions\"; exceptions are sometimes made for medical professionals working in these facilities)\n* '''Churches''', mosques and other \"Houses of worship,\" usually at the discretion of the church clergy (Ohio allows with specific permission of house of worship)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunstocarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Concealed-Carry-Laws-Manual.pdf|title=Ohio's Concealed Carry Laws and License Application|page=12|accessdate=2014-05-30}}</ref>\n* '''Municipal mass transit vehicles or facilities'''\n* '''Sterile areas of airports''' (sections of the airport located beyond security screening checkpoints, unless explicitly authorized)\n* '''Non-government facilities with heightened security measures''' (Nuclear facilities, power plants, dams, oil and gas production facilities, banks, factories, unless explicitly authorized)\n* '''Aboard aircraft or ships''' unless specifically authorized by the pilot in command or ship captain\n* '''Private property''' where the lawful owner or lessee has posted a sign or verbally stated that firearms are not permitted\n* '''Any public place, while under the influence of alcohol or drugs''' (including certain prescription or over-the-counter medications, depending on jurisdiction)\n\n===\"Opt-out\" statutes (\"gun-free zones\")===\nSome states allow private businesses to post a specific sign prohibiting concealed carry within their premises. The exact language and format of such a sign varies by state. By posting the signs, businesses create areas where it is illegal to carry a concealed handgun; similar to regulations concerning schools, hospitals, and public gatherings.\n\nViolation of such a sign, in some of these states, is grounds for revocation of the offender's concealed carry permit and criminal prosecution. Other states, such as Virginia, enforce only trespassing laws when a person violates a \"Gun Free Zone\" sign. In some jurisdictions trespass by a person carrying a firearm may have more severe penalties than \"simple\" trespass, while in other jurisdictions, penalties are lower than for trespass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 624, Section 714, Subdivision 17|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=624.714#stat.624.714.17|website=Minnesota Statutes|publisher=Minnesota Revisor of Statutes|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuch states include: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nebraska Revised Statute 69-2441|url=http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=69-2441|website=Nebraska Statutes|publisher=Nebraska Legislature|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nThere is considerable dispute over the effectiveness of such \"[[gun-free zone]]s\". Opponents of such measures, such as [[OpenCarry.org]], state that, much like other ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' laws banning gun-related practices, only law-abiding individuals will heed the signage and disarm. Individuals or groups intent on committing far more serious crimes, such as armed robbery or murder, will not be deterred by signage prohibiting weapons. Further, the reasoning follows that those wishing to commit mass murder might ''intentionally'' choose gun-free venues like shopping malls, schools and churches (where weapons carry is generally prohibited by statute or signage) because the population inside is disarmed and thus less able to stop them.<ref name=\"Hetzner-MLR\">{{cite journal|last=Hetzner|first=Amy|title=Where Angels Tread: Gun-Free School Zone Laws and an Individual Right to Bear Arms|journal=Marquette Law Review|year=2011\u20132012|volume=95|pages=359\u201398|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/marqlr95&div=13&id=&page=}}</ref>\n\nIn some states, business owners have been documented posting signs that appear to prohibit guns, but legally do not because the signs do not meet local or state laws defining required appearance, placement, or wording of signage. Such signage can be posted out of ignorance to the law, or intent to pacify gun control advocates while not actually prohibiting the practice. The force of law behind a non-compliant sign varies based on state statutes and case law. Some states interpret their statutes' high level of specification of signage as evidence that the signage must meet the specification exactly, and any quantifiable deviation from the statute makes the sign non-binding. Other states have decided in case law that if efforts were made in good faith to conform to the statutes, the sign carries the force of law even if it fails to meet current specification. Still others have such lax descriptions of what is a valid sign that virtually any sign that can be interpreted as \"no guns allowed\" is binding on the license holder.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nNote that virtually all jurisdictions allow some form of oral communication by the lawful owner or controller of the property that a person is not welcome and should leave. This notice can be given to anyone for any reason (except for statuses that are protected by the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and other CRAs, such as race),{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} including due to the carrying of firearms by that person, and refusal to heed such a request to leave may constitute trespassing.\n\n===Brandishing and printing===\nPrinting refers to a circumstance where the shape or outline of a firearm is visible through a garment while the gun is still fully covered, and is generally not desired when carrying a concealed weapon. Brandishing can refer to different actions depending on jurisdiction. These actions can include printing through a garment, pulling back clothing to expose a gun, or unholstering a gun and exhibiting it in the hand. The intent to intimidate or threaten someone may or may not be required legally for it to be considered brandishing.\n\nBrandishing is a crime in most jurisdictions, but the definition of brandishing varies widely.\n\nUnder California law, the following conditions have to be present to prove brandishing:\n\n{{quote|[1] A person, in the presence of another person, drew or exhibited a [deadly weapon, other than a firearm] [firearm, whether loaded or unloaded]; [and] [2] That person did so in a rude, angry, or threatening manner [or] [2] That person, in any manner, unlawfully used the [deadly weapon] [firearm] in a fight or quarrel] [.] [; and [3] The person was not acting in lawful self-defense.]<ref name=\"shouselaw\">{{cite web|title=Brandishing a Weapon, Gun or Firearm |url=http://www.shouselaw.com/brandishing-weapon-pc417.html|accessdate=2014-02-19}}</ref>}}\n\nIn Virginia law:\n\n{{quote|It shall be unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or hold a firearm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured.

During the application process for concealed carry states carry out thorough background checks to prevent these individuals from obtaining permits. Additionally the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] created an FBI maintained system in 1994 for instantly checking the backgrounds of potential firearms buyers in an effort to prevent these individuals from obtaining weapons.\n\n=== Firearm Owners Protection Act ===\nThe [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] (FOPA) of 1986 allows a [[Gun law in the United States|gun owner]] to travel through [[U.S. states|states]] in which their firearm possession is illegal as long as it is [[Gun laws in the United States by state|legal in the states]] of origination and destination, the owner is in transit and does not remain in the state in which firearm possession is illegal, and the firearm is transported unloaded and in a locked container. The FOPA addresses the issue of transport of private firearms from origin to destination for purposes lawful in state of origin and destination; FOPA does not authorize concealed carry as a weapon of defense during transit. [[New York State Police]] arrested those carrying firearms in violation of state law, and then required them to use FOPA as an [[affirmative defense]] to the charges of illegal possession.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act===\nIn 2004, the [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act]], 18&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Code 926B and 926C. This federal law allows two classes of persons&nbsp;\u2013 the \"qualified law enforcement officer\" and the \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" \u2013 to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of any state or local law to the contrary, with certain exceptions.\n\n===Federal Gun Free School Zones Act===\n[[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990|The Federal Gun Free School Zone Act]] limits where a person may legally carry a firearm. It does this by making it generally unlawful for an armed citizen to be within 1,000 feet (extending out from the property lines) of a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a K\u201312 school. Although a state-issued carry permit may exempt a person from this restriction in the state that physically issued their permit, it does not exempt them in other states which recognize their permit under reciprocity agreements made with the issuing state.\n\nThe law's failure to provide adequate protection to [[Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act|LEOSA]]-qualified officers, licensed concealed carry permit holders, and other armed citizens, is an issue that the United States Congress so far has not addressed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Federal property===\nSome federal statutes restrict the carrying of firearms on the premises of certain federal properties such as military installations or land controlled by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|USACE]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=631dea6d364fc8790efb67d9478168ee&rgn=div8&view=text&node=36:3.0.1.1.3.0.1.14&idno=36 |title=Title 36 CFR \u00a7327.13 |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov|accessdate=2010-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612174340/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=631dea6d364fc8790efb67d9478168ee&rgn=div8&view=text&node=36%3A3.0.1.1.3.0.1.14&idno=36 |archivedate=2011-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===National park carry===\nOn May 22, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] signed H.R. 627, the \"Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009,\" into law.

Opponents of national reciprocity have pointed out that this legislation would effectively require states with more restrictive standards of permit issuance (e.g., training courses, safety exams, \"good cause\" requirements, et al.) to honor permits from states with more liberal issuance policies. Supporters have pointed out that the same situation already occurs with marriage certificates, adoption decrees and other state documents under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause|\"full faith and credit\" clause of the U.S. Constitution]].<ref>Constitution for the United States of America, Article IV, Section 1: \"Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.

In the [[Orbiter dicta|dicta]] from a maritime law case the Supreme Court commented that state laws restricting concealed weapons do not infringe upon the right to bear arms protected by the federal [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].<ref name=\"isbn1-57607-268-1\">{{cite book |author=Carter, Gregg Lee |title=Guns in American society: an encyclopedia of history, politics, culture, and the law |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2002 |page=506 |isbn=978-1-57607-268-4 |quote= Justice Brown spotlighted his belief that the guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms was not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H_RrLyV9rDUC&pg=RA1-PA506}}</ref> However, in the context of such rulings, [[open carry]] of firearms was generally unrestricted in the jurisdictions in question, which provided an alternative means of \"bearing\" arms.\n\nIn the majority decision in the 2008 Supreme Court case of ''[[District of Columbia v.

It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues ...

The Justices asserted that sensible restrictions on the right to bear arms are constitutional, however, an outright ban on a specific type of firearm, in this case handguns, was in fact unconstitutional. The Heller decision is limited because it only applies to federal enclaves such as the [[District of Columbia]]. In 2010 the SCOTUS expanded Heller in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'' incorporating the 2nd Amendment through the 14th Amendment as applying to local and state laws. Various Circuit Courts have upheld their local and state laws using intermediate scrutiny. The correct standard is strict scrutiny review for all \"fundamental\" and \"individual\" rights.<ref>Leonard W. Levy, ''Encyclopedia of the American Constitution'', Macmillan (1991), article \"Strict Scrutiny\" by Kenneth L. Karst. \"The term 'strict scrutiny' appears to have been used first by Justice William O. Douglas in his opinion for the Supreme Court in Skinner v.

In some states, liability is present when a resident brandishes the weapon, threatens use, or exacerbates a volatile situation, or when the resident is carrying while intoxicated. It is important to note that simply pointing a firearm at any person constitutes felony assault with a deadly weapon unless circumstances validate a demonstration of force. A majority of states who allow concealed carry, however, forbid suits being brought in such cases, either by barring lawsuits for damages resulting from a criminal act on the part of the plaintiff, or by granting the gun owner immunity from such a civil suit if it is found that he or she was justified in shooting.\n\nSimultaneously, increased passage of \"[[Castle Doctrine]]\" laws allow persons who own firearms and/or carry them concealed to use them without first attempting to retreat. The \"[[Castle Doctrine]]\" typically applies to situations within the confines of one's own home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0052.htm|title=Castle Doctrine and Self-Defense |website=ct.gov}}</ref> Nevertheless, many states have adopted escalation of force laws along with provisions for concealed carry. These include the necessity to first verbally warn a trespasser or lay hands on a trespasser before a shooting is justified (unless the trespasser is armed or assumed to be so). This escalation of force does not apply if the shooter reasonably believes a violent felony has been or is about to be committed on the property by the trespasser. Additionally some states have a [[duty to retreat]] provision which requires a permit holder, especially in public places, to vacate him or herself from a potentially dangerous situation before resorting to deadly force. The [[duty to retreat]] does not restrictively apply in a person's home or business though escalation of force may be required. In 1895 the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Beard v. United States]]'' (1895) that if an individual does not provoke an assault and is residing in a place they have a right to be then they may use considerable force against someone they reasonably believe may do them serious harm without being charged with murder or manslaughter should that person be killed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/158/550/case.html |title=Beard v.

In other states, lethal force is authorized only when serious harm is presumed to be imminent.\n\nEven given these relaxed restrictions on use of force, using a handgun must still be a last resort in some jurisdictions; meaning the user must reasonably believe that nothing short of deadly force will protect the life or property at stake in a situation. Additionally, civil liabilities for errors that cause harm to others still exist, although civil immunity is provided in the Castle Doctrine laws of some states (e.g., Texas).<ref>{{cite web |title=Sec. 83.001.

Many societies both past and present have placed restrictions on what forms of weaponry private citizens (and to a lesser extent police) are allowed to purchase, own, and carry in public. Such crimes are [[public order crime]]s and are considered ''[[mala prohibita]]'', in that the possession of a weapon in and of itself is not evil. Rather, the ''potential'' for use in acts of unlawful violence creates a possible need to control them. Some restrictions are [[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]], whereas others require some element of [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to use the weapon for an illegal purpose. Some regulations allow a citizen to obtain a permit or other authorization to possess the weapon under certain circumstances. Lawful uses of weapons by civilians commonly include hunting, sport, collection and [[right of self-defense|self-preservation]].\n\nThe penalties for carrying a firearm in an unlawful manner varies widely from state-to-state, and may range from a simple infraction punishable by a fine to a felony conviction and mandatory incarceration. An individual may also be charged and convicted of criminal charges other than unlawful possession of a firearm, such as [[assault]], [[disorderly conduct]], or [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]]. In the case of an individual with no prior criminal convictions, the state of [[Tennessee]] classifies the unlawful concealed carry of a loaded handgun as a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days imprisonment and/or a $500 fine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-39/chapter-17/part-13/39-17-1307/ | title=2010 Tennessee Code :: Title 39 - Criminal Offenses :: Chapter 17 - Offenses Against Public Health, Safety and Welfare :: :: Part 13 - Weapons :: :: 39-17-1307 - Unlawful carrying or possession of a weapon}}</ref> While in [[New York State]], a similar crime committed by an individual with no criminal convictions is classified as a Class D felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years imprisonment, to a maximum of 7 years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article265.htm#p265.02 | title=Article 265 Penal Law Firearms &#124; Dangerous Weapons &#124; NY Law}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.criminaldefense.sullivangalleshaw.com/sentencing-guidelines-for-criminal-possession-of-a-weapon-in-new-york/ | title=Sentencing Guidelines for Possession of Weapon in NY}}</ref> As New York State does not recognize any pistol permits issued in other states, the statute would apply to any individual who does not have a valid New York State issued concealed carry permit, even if such individual has a valid permit issued in another jurisdiction.<ref>http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/newyork.pdf</ref> In addition, the New York State statutory definition of a \"loaded firearm\" differs significantly from what may be commonly understood, as simply possessing any ammunition along with a weapon capable of firing such ammunition satisfies the legal definition of a loaded firearm in New York.<ref>https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/guide/state-laws-and-published-ordinances-2010-2011-new-york/download</ref> The large variability of state carry laws has resulted in confusing circumstances where a person in [[Vermont]] (which requires no license of any kind to carry a concealed weapon by anyone who is not prohibited by law), could unwittingly travel into the adjacent state of New York, where such individual, despite acting entirely within the law of Vermont, would then face a mandatory 3.5 year prison sentence simply for accidentally crossing the state's border into New York.

This is sometimes called [[constitutional carry]]. Within the unrestricted category, there exists states that are ''fully unrestricted,'' where no permit is required for lawful open or concealed carry, and ''partially unrestricted,'' where certain forms of concealed carry may be legal without a permit, while other forms of carry may require a permit.\n\nAmong U.S. states, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky (effective June 26, 2019), Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota (residents only; concealed carry only), Oklahoma (effective Nov. 1, 2019), South Dakota (effective July 1, 2019), Vermont, West Virginia<ref name=\"theintelligencer.net\"/> and Wyoming (residents only) are fully unrestricted, and allow those who are not prohibited from owning a firearm to carry a concealed firearm in any place not deemed off-limits by law without a permit. North Dakota and Wyoming only extend permitless carry to residents of the state; non-residents must still have a permit issued by their home state to legally carry concealed in these states. Permitless concealed carry in Mississippi only covers certain manners of carrying; see table above. These states also allow the [[open carry]] of a handgun without a permit with the exception of North Dakota and certain localities in Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dps.state.ak.us/statewide/permitslicensing/concealedhandguns.aspx |title=Alaska Concealed Handgun Permits&nbsp;\u2013 Permits and Licensing Unit |publisher=Dps.state.ak.us|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullchapter.cfm?Title=13&Chapter=085 |title=The Vermont Statutes Online |publisher=Leg.state.vt.us|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref><ref name=\"thewyonews.net\">{{cite web|url=http://thewyonews.net/2011/03/02/gov-mead-signs-bill-allowing-concealed-carry-without-a-permit/ |title=Governor Mead Signs Bill Allowed Concealed-Carry Without a Permit |publisher=thewyonews.net|accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305170737/http://thewyonews.net/2011/03/02/gov-mead-signs-bill-allowing-concealed-carry-without-a-permit/ |archivedate=March 5, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://concealednation.org/2015/07/maine-governor-to-sign-law-today-that-will-eliminate-the-requirement-for-permit-to-carry-concealed/ |title=Maine Governor To Sign Law Today That Will Eliminate The Requirement For Permit To Carry Concealed |date=2015-07-08 |publisher=concealednation.org|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_127th/billtexts/SP024501.asp |title=An Act To Authorize the Carrying of Concealed Handguns without a Permit |publisher=state.me.us|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>\n\nVermont does not have any provision for issue of concealed-carry licenses, as none has ever been necessary. As such, Vermont residents wishing to carry handguns in other states must acquire a license from a state which is valid in their destination. A popular choice is Florida's concealed handgun permit, which is valid for nonresident holders in 28 other states. All other [[constitutional carry]] states previously had concealed-carry license requirements prior to adoption of unrestricted carry laws, and continue to issue licenses on a shall-issue basis for the purposes of inter-state reciprocity (allowing residents of the state to travel to other states with a concealed weapon, abiding by that state's law).\n\nThe states of Montana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma are partially unrestricted states. Specifically, Montana currently allows concealed carry without a permit in places outside of any incorporated municipality. [[New Mexico]] laws allow an individual to conceal carry an unloaded handgun without a permit. New Mexico further allows one to carry a loaded handgun either openly or concealed while traveling in a vehicle, including motorcycles, recreational vehicles (RVs), bicycles or while riding a horse. Oklahoma allows residents of permitless carry states to carry openly or concealed without a permit, provided such individuals have a valid ID from their home state. All of the aforementioned states grant permits on a shall-issue basis for modes of concealed carry that require a permit.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, Washington D.C. became a constitutional carry jurisdiction for a brief moment when its ban on carrying a handgun was ruled unconstitutional and the ruling was not stayed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Palmer-v.-District-of-Columbia_Memorandum-Decision-and-Order-re-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Summary-Judgment-and-Defendants-Cross-Motion-for-Summary-Judgment.pdf|title=Palmer v.

The laws in a Shall-Issue jurisdiction typically state that a granting authority ''shall issue'' a license if the criteria are met, as opposed to laws in which the authority ''may issue'' a license at their discretion.\n\nTypical license requirements include residency, minimum age, submitting fingerprints, passing a computerized instant background check (or a more comprehensive manual background check), attending a certified handgun/firearm safety class, passing a practical qualification demonstrating handgun proficiency, and paying a required fee. These requirements vary widely by jurisdiction, with some having few or none of these and others having most or all.\n\nThe following are shall-issue states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina,<ref name=\"NC_SI_law\"/> North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,<ref name=\"OR_SI_law\"/> Pennsylvania, Rhode Island (for permits issued by local authorities), South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,<ref name=\"TN_SI_law\"/> Texas,<ref name=\"TX_CHL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/CHL/index.htm |title=Concealed Handgun Licensing Program |publisher=[[Texas Department of Public Safety]] |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614194349/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/rsd/chl/index.htm |archive-date=2013-06-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"TX_SI_law\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.411.htm#411.172 |title=Texas Government Code, Chapter 411, Subchapter H.

[[Connecticut]], and certain cities and counties in [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York State|New York]] are examples.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nConnecticut law specifies that CCW licenses be granted on a may-issue basis, but the state's courts have established that issuing authorities must grant CCW licenses on a shall-issue basis for applicants who meet all statutory qualifications, as unlike other may-issue states Connecticut law does not contain a requirement for the applicant to show \"necessary and proper reason\" for obtaining a license.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n''Shall-issue with limited discretion'' is a subset of shall-issue licensing that borders between pure shall-issue and may-issue policy, where an issuing authority has a limited degree of discretion to deny applicants a concealed carry permit based either on the applicant's suitability or reason for requesting a permit, even after the applicant has completed any required training and passed a background check. In states with such licensing practices, the issuing authority would be required to demonstrate with substantiating evidence, that the applicant is either not suitable or lacks appropriate need for the permit. Most denials in such states are typically reversed upon appeal provided the applicant has passed a background check and fulfilled any training requirements for the permit. States with shall-issue laws that allow a limited degree of discretion include [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. Although may-issue by statute, [[Connecticut]] also falls into this subset, in practice.\n\nSome shall-issue jurisdictions allow for automatic renewal of concealed carry permits, as long as the permit-holder files the renewal application before the permit expires (or in some states, a short grace period following expiration of the original permit). Other jurisdictions require a permit-holder to complete refresher training in firearms safety and undergo a criminal background check before applying for renewal. Some jurisdictions periodically run permit holders' IDs through the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|NICS]] background check system. Other jurisdictions require a judge to suspend a permit if the holder is arrested for certain offenses (return/revocation of the permit depending on later disposition of the case).\n\n====May-issue====\nA '''may-issue''' jurisdiction is one that requires a [[License|permit]] to carry a concealed handgun, and where the granting of such permits is partially at the discretion of local authorities (frequently the [[sheriff's department]] or [[police]]), with a few states consolidating this discretionary power under state-level law enforcement. Moreover, issuing authorities in most may-issue jurisdictions are not required to provide a substantive reason for the denial of a concealed carry permit. Some may-issue jurisdictions may provide administrative and legal avenues for an applicant to appeal a permit denial, while others do not.\n\nThe law typically states that a granting authority \"may issue\" a permit if various criteria are met, or that the permit applicant must have \"good cause\" (or similar) to carry a concealed weapon. In most such situations, self-defense in and of itself often does not satisfy the \"good cause\" requirement, and issuing authorities in some may-issue jurisdictions have been known to arbitrarily deny applications for CCW permits without providing the applicant with any substantive reason for the denial. Some may-issue jurisdictions require a permit-holder to provide justification for continued need for a concealed carry permit upon renewal, and may deny the renewal of an expiring permit without sufficient showing of \"good cause.\" Some of these jurisdictions may revoke a permit after it has been issued when the issuing authority in its discretion has determined that the \"good cause\" used in approving the permit application no longer exists. Other may-issue jurisdictions allow for automatic renewal of the permit, as long as the permit-holder completes any required firearms safety training and files the renewal application before the permit expires. Some may-issue jurisdictions give issuing authorities discretion in granting concealed carry permits based on an applicant's suitability (e.g., moral character) by requiring the applicant to submit evidence (resume/curriculum vitae, letters of reference, credit history, etc.) showing the applicant is of suitable character to be issued a permit.\n\nWhen distinguishing between shall-issue and may-issue, that distinction may not necessarily be explicitly apparent in the exact letter of the law. Rather, a more accurate determinant as to whether a state is shall-issue versus may-issue is whether or not the applicant is required to show \"good cause\" when applying for a permit. Court precedent also plays an important role in determining whether a state is may-issue or shall-issue without regard to the verbiage in state law. For example, New York is a may-issue state, even though its concealed carry licensing laws includes the words \"shall issue,\" because New York law requires applicants to show \"good cause\" when applying for a concealed carry permit. Since \"good cause\" is highly subjective, issuing authorities in New York have wide discretion in determining what constitutes \"good cause,\" and the ability for an ordinary citizen to obtain a concealed carry permit varies widely throughout the state. In contrast, the pistol permit law in neighboring Connecticut contains the words \"may issue,\" despite Connecticut effectively being a shall-issue state. This is because Connecticut's pistol permit law does not require the applicant to show \"good cause\" to the issuing authority when applying for a pistol permit. Because Connecticut's permitting law lacks a subjective \"good cause\" standard, that state's courts have repeatedly and consistently ruled that issuing authorities must issue pistol permits to applicants who meet the state's statutory qualifications for a pistol permit.\n\nMay-issue can be compared to shall-issue where in a may-issue jurisdiction, the burden of proof for justifying the need for a permit rests with the applicant, whereas in a shall-issue jurisdiction the burden of proof to justify denying a permit rests with the issuing authority.\n\nThe following are may-issue states by law: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Rhode Island]].\n\nA state that is ''[[de jure]]'' a may-issue jurisdiction may range anywhere from shall-issue to no-issue in practice,<ref name=\"i2i-shall-issue\">{{cite web |url= http://www.i2i.org/main/article.php?article_id=643&print=1 |title= &thinsp;'Shall Issue': The New Wave of Concealed Handgun Permit Laws |accessdate= 2008-04-13 |author= Clayton E.

Additionally Maryland and New Jersey require the applicant provide substantive evidence of a clear and immediate threat on their lives that exists outside of their home at the time the permit application is filed. Rhode Island further requires applicants for the statewide permit to submit to a mental health records check at the applicant's expense.\n* [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] vary within state, as the criteria for what constitutes \"good cause\" is defined at the local level. Issuing authorities in inland California, rural portions of Massachusetts, and [[Upstate New York]] generally accept self-defense without evidence of a specific threat as \"good cause\" and will grant permits to the vast majority of applicants who pass a background check and complete the required firearms safety training. Meanwhile, concealed carry permits are difficult to virtually impossible to obtain by ordinary citizens in urban areas, such as [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[San Francisco]] metropolitan areas. In these locations, the definition of \"good cause\" is generally limited to specific and immediate threats on an applicant's life that cannot be mitigated by any other means. There are also \"moderately restrictive\" local jurisdictions in these states where the local \"good cause\" definitions may be more restrictive than locales that practice shall-issue licensing, but less restrictive than those counties or municipalities that rarely or never issue permits.\n* [[Rhode Island]] state law is two-tier; local authorities are directed by state law and court precedent (''Archer v McGarry'') to practice shall-issue permitting policy, but the Attorney General's office has discretionary authority over permits issued by its office. The permits issued by both the local authorities and the AG are valid statewide, but the AG issued permit is required for open carry in general. Some local jurisdictions, at the recommendation of the AG, still refer all applicants to the AG's office and the \"may-issue\" state-level system in violation of ''Archer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usacarry.com/rhode_island_concealed_carry_permit_information.html|title=Rhode Island Concealed Carry Permit Information|website=USA Carry}}</ref>\n\nIn some may-issue jurisdictions, permits are only issued to individuals with celebrity status, have political connections, or have a high degree of wealth,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-284.html | title=Fighting Back: Crime, Self-Defense, and the Right to Carry a Handgun | publisher=Cato Institute | accessdate=January 3, 2012 | author=Snyder, Jeffrey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/madoff_son_of_gun_LDcUvEw9PXY0rS1oNFfl1J | title=Madoff son of a gun Bernie kid on pistol-permit list | publisher=NY Post | accessdate=January 3, 2012| date=2009-12-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/nyregion/20guns.html | title=The Rich, the Famous, the Armed | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 18, 2011 |author=Jo Craven McGinty | accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> resulting in accusations of systematic corruption in how CCW permit applications are adjudicated in some such jurisdictions.<ref>http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/21/fox-business-john-stossel-tried-to-get-a-new-york-gun-permitit-turned-out-poorly-n2151874 Fox Business\u2019 John Stossel Tried To Get A New York Gun Permit \u2013 It Turned Out Poorly townhall.com April 21, 2016.</ref> Additionally, issuing authorities charge arbitrarily defined fees that go well beyond the basic processing fee for a CCW permit, thereby making the CCW permit unaffordable to most applicants. For example, applying for a New York City concealed carry permit typically costs around $5,000 when the filing fee and other administrative fees are combined.\n\nIn recent cases challenging restrictive discretionary issue laws, federal district and appeals courts have generally applied [[intermediate scrutiny]] to these and other Second Amendment related cases, where the courts recognize that restrictive concealed carry laws \"infringe on an individual's right to keep and bear arms,\" but also recognizes that such infringement is permitted to further \"an important government interest in public safety.\" Any and all other Rights that are described as \"individual\" and \"fundamental\" by the SCOTUS require a \"strict scrutiny\" standard as shown in prior decisions involving fully applicable incorporation cases. In Maryland, ''[[Woollard v. Sheridan]]'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]] decided in favor of a Maryland resident who was denied a permit renewal due to lack of \"good cause\" in accordance with Maryland law.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Woollard v.

Filko, involving several plaintiffs (including one kidnap victim) denied permits under New Jersey's permitting system; the suit challenged New Jersey's \"justifiable need\" requirement for obtaining a carry permit. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] affirmed the lower court's judgment holding the requirement constitutional, holding (much like the 4th Circuit in ''Woollard'' and the 2nd Circuit in ''Kachalsky'') that the New Jersey statute survived [[intermediate scrutiny]].<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Drake v.

The courts have opined that these laws survive intermediate scrutiny on that basis. However, all other \"fundamental\" and \"individual\" Rights are subjected to a \"strict scrutiny\" standard, see, Duncan, 391 U.S. at 149, and n. 15, supra., \"A right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States.\"\n\n====Concealed carry on U.S. military installations====\nWhile members of the Armed Services may receive extensive small arms training, [[United States Military]] installations have some of the most restrictive rules for the possession, transport, and carrying of personally-owned firearms in the country.\n\nOverall authority for carrying a personally-owned firearm on a military installation rests with the installation commander, although the authority to permit individuals to carry firearms on an installation is usually delegated to the [[Provost Marshal]]. Military installations do not recognize state-issued concealed carry permits, and state firearms laws generally do not apply to military bases, regardless of the state in which the installation is located. Federal law (18 USC, Section 930) generally forbids the possession, transport, and carrying of firearms on military installations without approval from the installation commander. Federal law gives installation commanders wide discretion in establishing firearms policies for their respective installations. In practice, local discretion is often constrained by policies and directives from the headquarters of each military branch and major commands.\n\nInstallation policies can vary from no-issue for most bases to shall-issue in rare circumstances. Installations that do allow the carrying of firearms typically restrict carrying to designated areas and for specific purposes (i.e., hunting or officially sanctioned shooting competitions in approved locations on the installation). Installation commanders may require the applicant complete extensive firearms safety training, undergo a mental health evaluation, and obtain a letter of recommendation from his or her unit commander (or employer) before such authorization is granted. Personnel that reside on a military installation are typically required to store their personally-owned firearms in the installation armory, although the installation commander or provost marshal may permit a servicemember to store his or her personal firearms in their on-base dwelling if he or she has a [[gun safe]] or similarly designed cabinet where the firearms can be secured.\n\nPrior to 2011, military commanders could impose firearms restrictions to servicemembers residing off-base, such as mandatory registration of firearms with the base Provost Marshal, restricting or banning the carrying of firearms by servicemembers either on or off the installation regardless of whether the member had a state permit to carry, and requiring servicemembers to have a gun safe or similar container to secure firearms when not in use. A provision was included in the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011]] that limited commanders' authority to impose restrictions on the possession and use of personally-owned firearms by servicemembers who reside off-base.\n\n====No-issue====\nA '''no-issue''' jurisdiction is one that&nbsp;\u2013 with very limited exceptions&nbsp;\u2013 does not allow any private citizen to carry a concealed handgun in public. The term refers to the fact that no concealed carry permits will be issued (or recognized). Since July 2013, with the legalization of concealed carry in Illinois, there are presently no no-issue states ''per se''; with only the territory of American Samoa being the only U.S. jurisdiction that completely prohibits concealed carry.\n\nWhile technically may-issue under state law, [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and certain cities and counties within [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] are no-issue jurisdictions in practice, with governmental policy directing officials with discretionary power to rarely or never issue licenses. Additionally, some of the United States' insular territories ([[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], etc.) are no-issue jurisdictions in practice. Most no-issue jurisdictions have exceptions to their laws that permit open or concealed carry by active and retired law enforcement officials, armed security personnel while on duty and in uniform, and for members of the Armed Forces. Wisconsin and Illinois were the last remaining no-issue states, until licensed concealed carry was legalized in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Prior to legalization, Wisconsin outlawed concealed carry, but open carry was legal statewide. Illinois had banned concealed carry, and generally prohibited open carry in most locations as well.\n\n====Limitations on concealed carry====\n\nProhibitions of the concealed carry of firearms and other weapons by local governments predate the establishment of the United States. In 1686, New Jersey law stated \u201cno person or persons \u2026 shall presume privately to wear any pocket pistol \u2026 or other unusual or unlawful weapons within this Province.\u201d  After the federal government was established, states and localities continued to restrict people from carrying hidden weapons. Tennessee law prohibited this as early as 1821. By 1837, Georgia passed into effect \u201cAn Act to guard and protect the citizens of this State, against the unwarrantable and too prevalent use of deadly weapons.\u201d Two years later, Alabama followed suit with \u201cAn Act to Suppress the Evil Practice of Carrying Weapons Secretly.\u201d Delaware prohibited the practice in 1852.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Robert J.|first1=Spitzer|title=Even in the Wild West, there were rules about carrying concealed weapons|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-spitzer-peruta-concealed-carry-20160619-snap-story.html|accessdate=21 June 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=19 June 2016}}</ref> Ohio did the same in 1859, a policy that remained in effect until 1974.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Joe|first1=Eaton|last2=Chad D.|first2=Baus|title=Ohio Gun Rights Timeline|url=http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/ohio-gun-rights-timeline-journey-towards-freedom|website=Buckeye Firearms Association|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Cities also regulated weapons within their boundaries. In 1881, [[Tombstone, Arizona]] enacted Ordinance No. 9 \"To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons,\" a regulation that sparked the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] later that year.\n\nMost may-issue jurisdictions, and some shall-issue jurisdictions allow issuing authorities to impose limitations on CCW permits, such as the type and caliber of handguns that may be carried ([[Massachusetts]], [[New Mexico]]), restrictions on places where the permit is valid ([[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Illinois]]), restricting concealed carry to purposes or activities specified on the approved permit application ([[California]], Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York), limitations on magazine size ([[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], New York), or limitations on the number of firearms that may be carried concealed by a permit-holder at any given time (some states). Permits issued by all but two states (New York and Hawaii) are valid statewide. New York State pistol licenses, which are generally issued by counties, are valid statewide with one exception. A permit not issued by New York City is invalid in that city, unless validated by its police commissioner.<ref name=\"New York State License Validity\">[http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article400.htm#p400.00 N.Y.

Most required CCW training courses devote a considerable amount of time to liability issues.\n\nDepending on the state, a practical component during which the attendee shoots the weapon for the purpose of demonstrating safety and proficiency, may be required. During range instruction, applicants would typically learn and demonstrate safe handling and operation of a firearm and accurate shooting from common self-defense distances. Some states require a certain proficiency to receive a passing grade, whereas other states (e.g., Florida) technically require only a single-shot be fired to demonstrate handgun handling proficiency.\n\nCCW training courses are typically completed in a single day and are good for a set period, the exact duration varying by state. Some states require re-training, sometimes in a shorter, simpler format, for each renewal.\n\nA few states, e.g., South Carolina, recognize the safety and use-of-force training given to military personnel as acceptable in lieu of formal civilian training certification. Such states will ask for a [[United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card|military ID]] (South Carolina) for active persons or [[DD214]] for honorably discharged persons. These few states will commonly request a copy of the applicant's BTR (Basic Training Record) proving an up-to-date pistol qualification. Active and retired law enforcement officers are generally exempt from qualification requirements, due to a federal statute permitting retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flsenate.gov/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=Ch0790/ch0790.htm |title=Florida Statute 790}}</ref>\n\nVirginia recognizes eight specific training options to prove competency in handgun handling, ranging from DD214 for honorably discharged military veterans, to certification from law enforcement training, to firearms training conducted by a state or NRA certified firearms instructor including electronic, video, or on-line courses. While any one of the eight listed options will be considered adequate proof, individual circuit courts may recognize other training options.<ref name=\"vsp.state.va.us\"/> A small number of states, such as Alabama and Georgia, have no training requirements to obtain a permit\u2014only a requirement that the applicant successfully pass the required background check before issuance.\n\n===Reciprocity===\n[[File:Permit reciprocity.svg|thumb|300x300px|<p>Level of permit reciprocity (recognition of out-of-state permits)<ref name=\"handgunlaw.us\"/><ref>http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/USStatesThatHonorMyPermit.pdf</ref></p>{{legend|#008000|Full reciprocity}}{{legend|#00cd00|Full reciprocity for resident permits}}{{legend|#0000FF|Vehicle carry only}}{{legend|#FFA500|Partial reciprocity}}{{legend|#FF0000|No reciprocity}}]]\n[[File:CCW reciprocity.png|CCW reciprocity|thumb|400x400px|<p>CCW Reciprocity</p>]]\n<!--Outdated and inaccurate image[[File:CCW Recognition.jpg|thumb|500px|Concealed Carry recognition by State]]-->\nMany jurisdictions recognize (honor) a permit or license issued by other jurisdictions. Recognition may be granted to all jurisdictions or some subset which meets a set of permit-issuing criteria, such as training comparable to the honoring jurisdiction or certain background checks. Several states have entered into formal agreements to mutually recognize permits. This arrangement is commonly called reciprocity or mutual recognition. A few states do not recognize permits issued by any other jurisdiction, but offer non-resident permits for out-of-state individuals (who possess a valid concealed carry permit from their home state) who wish to carry while visiting such states. There are also states that neither recognize out-of-state concealed carry permits nor issue permits to non-residents, resulting in a complete ban on concealed carry by non-residents in such states.  There are also states that do not recognize out-of-state permits for carry on-foot, but do permit individuals with out-of-state concealed carry permits to carry while traveling in their vehicle (normally in accordance with the rules of the state of issuance).\n\nRecognition and reciprocity of concealed carry privileges varies. Some states (e.g. Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio) unilaterally recognize all permits. Others such as Michigan, limit such universal recognition to residents of the permit-issuing state.<ref name=\"usacarry.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usacarry.com/concealed_carry_permit_information.html |title=''Concealed Carry (CCW) Laws by State'' on |publisher=Usacarry.com|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> While 37&nbsp;states have reciprocity agreements with at least one other state and several states honor all out-of-state concealed carry permits, some states have special requirements like training courses or safety exams, and therefore do not honor permits from states that do not have such requirements for issue. Some states make exceptions for persons under the minimum age (usually 21) if they are active or honorably-discharged members of the military or a police force (the second of these two is allowed under federal law). States that do not have this exemption generally do not recognize any license from states that do. An example of this is the state of Washington's refusal to honor any Texas&nbsp;LTC as Texas has the military exception to age.<ref>[http://www.atg.wa.gov/page.aspx?id=7772 State of Washington reciprocity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606120455/http://www.atg.wa.gov/page.aspx?id=7772 |date=2011-06-06 }}.

These areas vary by state (except for the first item below; federal offices are subject to superseding federal law) and can include:\n* '''Federal government facilities''', including post offices, IRS offices, federal court buildings, military/VA facilities and/or correctional facilities, Amtrak trains and facilities, and Corps of Engineers-controlled property (carry in these places is prohibited by federal law and preempts any existing state law). Carry on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (federal parks and wildlife preserves) is allowed by federal law as of the 2009 CARD Act, but is still subject to state law. However, carry into restrooms or any other buildings or structures located within federal parks is illegal in the United States, despite concealed carry being otherwise legal in federal parks with a permit recognized by the state in which the federal park is located. Similarly, concealed carry into caves located within federal parks is illegal.\n* '''State and local government facilities''', including courthouses, DMV/DoT offices, police stations, correctional facilities, and/or meeting places of government entities (exceptions may be made for certain persons working in these facilities such as judges, lawyers, and certain government officials both elected and appointed)\n* '''Venues for political events''', including rallies, parades, debates, and/or polling places\n* '''Educational institutions''' including elementary/secondary schools and colleges. Some states have \"drop-off exceptions\" which only prohibit carry inside school buildings, or permit carry while inside a personal vehicle on school property. [[Campus carry in the United States|Campus carry]] laws vary by state.\n* '''Public interscholastic{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and/or professional sporting events''' and/or venues (sometimes only during a time window surrounding such an event)\n* '''Amusement parks, fairs, parades and/or carnivals'''{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n* '''Businesses that sell alcohol''' (sometimes only \"by-the-drink\" sellers like restaurants, sometimes only establishments defined as a \"bar\" or \"nightclub\", or establishments where the percentage of total sales from alcoholic beverages exceeds a specified threshold)\n* '''Hospitals''' (even if hospitals themselves are not restricted, \"teaching hospitals\" partnered with a medical school are sometimes considered \"educational institutions\"; exceptions are sometimes made for medical professionals working in these facilities)\n* '''Churches''', mosques and other \"Houses of worship,\" usually at the discretion of the church clergy (Ohio allows with specific permission of house of worship)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunstocarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Concealed-Carry-Laws-Manual.pdf|title=Ohio's Concealed Carry Laws and License Application|page=12|accessdate=2014-05-30}}</ref>\n* '''Municipal mass transit vehicles or facilities'''\n* '''Sterile areas of airports''' (sections of the airport located beyond security screening checkpoints, unless explicitly authorized)\n* '''Non-government facilities with heightened security measures''' (Nuclear facilities, power plants, dams, oil and gas production facilities, banks, factories, unless explicitly authorized)\n* '''Aboard aircraft or ships''' unless specifically authorized by the pilot in command or ship captain\n* '''Private property''' where the lawful owner or lessee has posted a sign or verbally stated that firearms are not permitted\n* '''Any public place, while under the influence of alcohol or drugs''' (including certain prescription or over-the-counter medications, depending on jurisdiction)\n\n===\"Opt-out\" statutes (\"gun-free zones\")===\nSome states allow private businesses to post a specific sign prohibiting concealed carry within their premises. The exact language and format of such a sign varies by state. By posting the signs, businesses create areas where it is illegal to carry a concealed handgun; similar to regulations concerning schools, hospitals, and public gatherings.\n\nViolation of such a sign, in some of these states, is grounds for revocation of the offender's concealed carry permit and criminal prosecution. Other states, such as Virginia, enforce only trespassing laws when a person violates a \"Gun Free Zone\" sign. In some jurisdictions trespass by a person carrying a firearm may have more severe penalties than \"simple\" trespass, while in other jurisdictions, penalties are lower than for trespass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 624, Section 714, Subdivision 17|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=624.714#stat.624.714.17|website=Minnesota Statutes|publisher=Minnesota Revisor of Statutes|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuch states include: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nebraska Revised Statute 69-2441|url=http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=69-2441|website=Nebraska Statutes|publisher=Nebraska Legislature|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nThere is considerable dispute over the effectiveness of such \"[[gun-free zone]]s\". Opponents of such measures, such as [[OpenCarry.org]], state that, much like other ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' laws banning gun-related practices, only law-abiding individuals will heed the signage and disarm. Individuals or groups intent on committing far more serious crimes, such as armed robbery or murder, will not be deterred by signage prohibiting weapons. Further, the reasoning follows that those wishing to commit mass murder might ''intentionally'' choose gun-free venues like shopping malls, schools and churches (where weapons carry is generally prohibited by statute or signage) because the population inside is disarmed and thus less able to stop them.<ref name=\"Hetzner-MLR\">{{cite journal|last=Hetzner|first=Amy|title=Where Angels Tread: Gun-Free School Zone Laws and an Individual Right to Bear Arms|journal=Marquette Law Review|year=2011\u20132012|volume=95|pages=359\u201398|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/marqlr95&div=13&id=&page=}}</ref>\n\nIn some states, business owners have been documented posting signs that appear to prohibit guns, but legally do not because the signs do not meet local or state laws defining required appearance, placement, or wording of signage. Such signage can be posted out of ignorance to the law, or intent to pacify gun control advocates while not actually prohibiting the practice. The force of law behind a non-compliant sign varies based on state statutes and case law. Some states interpret their statutes' high level of specification of signage as evidence that the signage must meet the specification exactly, and any quantifiable deviation from the statute makes the sign non-binding. Other states have decided in case law that if efforts were made in good faith to conform to the statutes, the sign carries the force of law even if it fails to meet current specification. Still others have such lax descriptions of what is a valid sign that virtually any sign that can be interpreted as \"no guns allowed\" is binding on the license holder.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nNote that virtually all jurisdictions allow some form of oral communication by the lawful owner or controller of the property that a person is not welcome and should leave. This notice can be given to anyone for any reason (except for statuses that are protected by the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and other CRAs, such as race),{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} including due to the carrying of firearms by that person, and refusal to heed such a request to leave may constitute trespassing.\n\n===Brandishing and printing===\nPrinting refers to a circumstance where the shape or outline of a firearm is visible through a garment while the gun is still fully covered, and is generally not desired when carrying a concealed weapon. Brandishing can refer to different actions depending on jurisdiction. These actions can include printing through a garment, pulling back clothing to expose a gun, or unholstering a gun and exhibiting it in the hand. The intent to intimidate or threaten someone may or may not be required legally for it to be considered brandishing.\n\nBrandishing is a crime in most jurisdictions, but the definition of brandishing varies widely.\n\nUnder California law, the following conditions have to be present to prove brandishing:\n\n{{quote|[1] A person, in the presence of another person, drew or exhibited a [deadly weapon, other than a firearm] [firearm, whether loaded or unloaded]; [and] [2] That person did so in a rude, angry, or threatening manner [or] [2] That person, in any manner, unlawfully used the [deadly weapon] [firearm] in a fight or quarrel] [.] [; and [3] The person was not acting in lawful self-defense.]<ref name=\"shouselaw\">{{cite web|title=Brandishing a Weapon, Gun or Firearm |url=http://www.shouselaw.com/brandishing-weapon-pc417.html|accessdate=2014-02-19}}</ref>}}\n\nIn Virginia law:\n\n{{quote|It shall be unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or hold a firearm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured.

During the application process for concealed carry states carry out thorough background checks to prevent these individuals from obtaining permits. Additionally the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] created an FBI maintained system in 1994 for instantly checking the backgrounds of potential firearms buyers in an effort to prevent these individuals from obtaining weapons.\n\n=== Firearm Owners Protection Act ===\nThe [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] (FOPA) of 1986 allows a [[Gun law in the United States|gun owner]] to travel through [[U.S. states|states]] in which their firearm possession is illegal as long as it is [[Gun laws in the United States by state|legal in the states]] of origination and destination, the owner is in transit and does not remain in the state in which firearm possession is illegal, and the firearm is transported unloaded and in a locked container. The FOPA addresses the issue of transport of private firearms from origin to destination for purposes lawful in state of origin and destination; FOPA does not authorize concealed carry as a weapon of defense during transit. [[New York State Police]] arrested those carrying firearms in violation of state law, and then required them to use FOPA as an [[affirmative defense]] to the charges of illegal possession.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act===\nIn 2004, the [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act]], 18&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Code 926B and 926C. This federal law allows two classes of persons&nbsp;\u2013 the \"qualified law enforcement officer\" and the \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" \u2013 to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of any state or local law to the contrary, with certain exceptions.\n\n===Federal Gun Free School Zones Act===\n[[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990|The Federal Gun Free School Zone Act]] limits where a person may legally carry a firearm. It does this by making it generally unlawful for an armed citizen to be within 1,000 feet (extending out from the property lines) of a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a K\u201312 school. Although a state-issued carry permit may exempt a person from this restriction in the state that physically issued their permit, it does not exempt them in other states which recognize their permit under reciprocity agreements made with the issuing state.\n\nThe law's failure to provide adequate protection to [[Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act|LEOSA]]-qualified officers, licensed concealed carry permit holders, and other armed citizens, is an issue that the United States Congress so far has not addressed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Federal property===\nSome federal statutes restrict the carrying of firearms on the premises of certain federal properties such as military installations or land controlled by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|USACE]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=631dea6d364fc8790efb67d9478168ee&rgn=div8&view=text&node=36:3.0.1.1.3.0.1.14&idno=36 |title=Title 36 CFR \u00a7327.13 |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov|accessdate=2010-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612174340/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=631dea6d364fc8790efb67d9478168ee&rgn=div8&view=text&node=36%3A3.0.1.1.3.0.1.14&idno=36 |archivedate=2011-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===National park carry===\nOn May 22, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] signed H.R. 627, the \"Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009,\" into law.

The Justices asserted that sensible restrictions on the right to bear arms are constitutional, however, an outright ban on a specific type of firearm, in this case handguns, was in fact unconstitutional. The Heller decision is limited because it only applies to federal enclaves such as the [[District of Columbia]]. In 2010 the SCOTUS expanded Heller in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'' incorporating the 2nd Amendment through the 14th Amendment as applying to local and state laws. Various Circuit Courts have upheld their local and state laws using intermediate scrutiny.

In some states, liability is present when a resident brandishes the weapon, threatens use, or exacerbates a volatile situation, or when the resident is carrying while intoxicated. It is important to note that simply pointing a firearm at any person constitutes felony assault with a deadly weapon unless circumstances validate a demonstration of force. A majority of states who allow concealed carry, however, forbid suits being brought in such cases, either by barring lawsuits for damages resulting from a criminal act on the part of the plaintiff, or by granting the gun owner immunity from such a civil suit if it is found that he or she was justified in shooting.\n\nSimultaneously, increased passage of \"[[Castle Doctrine]]\" laws allow persons who own firearms and/or carry them concealed to use them without first attempting to retreat. The \"[[Castle Doctrine]]\" typically applies to situations within the confines of one's own home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0052.htm|title=Castle Doctrine and Self-Defense |website=ct.gov}}</ref> Nevertheless, many states have adopted escalation of force laws along with provisions for concealed carry. These include the necessity to first verbally warn a trespasser or lay hands on a trespasser before a shooting is justified (unless the trespasser is armed or assumed to be so). This escalation of force does not apply if the shooter reasonably believes a violent felony has been or is about to be committed on the property by the trespasser. Additionally some states have a [[duty to retreat]] provision which requires a permit holder, especially in public places, to vacate him or herself from a potentially dangerous situation before resorting to deadly force. The [[duty to retreat]] does not restrictively apply in a person's home or business though escalation of force may be required. In 1895 the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Beard v. United States]]'' (1895) that if an individual does not provoke an assault and is residing in a place they have a right to be then they may use considerable force against someone they reasonably believe may do them serious harm without being charged with murder or manslaughter should that person be killed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/158/550/case.html |title=Beard v.

In other states, lethal force is authorized only when serious harm is presumed to be imminent.\n\nEven given these relaxed restrictions on use of force, using a handgun must still be a last resort in some jurisdictions; meaning the user must reasonably believe that nothing short of deadly force will protect the life or property at stake in a situation. Additionally, civil liabilities for errors that cause harm to others still exist, although civil immunity is provided in the Castle Doctrine laws of some states (e.g., Texas).<ref>{{cite web |title=Sec. 83.001.

Many societies both past and present have placed restrictions on what forms of weaponry private citizens (and to a lesser extent police) are allowed to purchase, own, and carry in public. Such crimes are [[public order crime]]s and are considered ''[[mala prohibita]]'', in that the possession of a weapon in and of itself is not evil. Rather, the ''potential'' for use in acts of unlawful violence creates a possible need to control them. Some restrictions are [[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]], whereas others require some element of [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to use the weapon for an illegal purpose. Some regulations allow a citizen to obtain a permit or other authorization to possess the weapon under certain circumstances. Lawful uses of weapons by civilians commonly include hunting, sport, collection and [[right of self-defense|self-preservation]].\n\nThe penalties for carrying a firearm in an unlawful manner varies widely from state-to-state, and may range from a simple infraction punishable by a fine to a felony conviction and mandatory incarceration. An individual may also be charged and convicted of criminal charges other than unlawful possession of a firearm, such as [[assault]], [[disorderly conduct]], or [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]]. In the case of an individual with no prior criminal convictions, the state of [[Tennessee]] classifies the unlawful concealed carry of a loaded handgun as a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days imprisonment and/or a $500 fine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-39/chapter-17/part-13/39-17-1307/ | title=2010 Tennessee Code :: Title 39 - Criminal Offenses :: Chapter 17 - Offenses Against Public Health, Safety and Welfare :: :: Part 13 - Weapons :: :: 39-17-1307 - Unlawful carrying or possession of a weapon}}</ref> While in [[New York State]], a similar crime committed by an individual with no criminal convictions is classified as a Class D felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years imprisonment, to a maximum of 7 years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article265.htm#p265.02 | title=Article 265 Penal Law Firearms &#124; Dangerous Weapons &#124; NY Law}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.criminaldefense.sullivangalleshaw.com/sentencing-guidelines-for-criminal-possession-of-a-weapon-in-new-york/ | title=Sentencing Guidelines for Possession of Weapon in NY}}</ref> As New York State does not recognize any pistol permits issued in other states, the statute would apply to any individual who does not have a valid New York State issued concealed carry permit, even if such individual has a valid permit issued in another jurisdiction.<ref>http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/newyork.pdf</ref> In addition, the New York State statutory definition of a \"loaded firearm\" differs significantly from what may be commonly understood, as simply possessing any ammunition along with a weapon capable of firing such ammunition satisfies the legal definition of a loaded firearm in New York.<ref>https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/guide/state-laws-and-published-ordinances-2010-2011-new-york/download</ref> The large variability of state carry laws has resulted in confusing circumstances where a person in [[Vermont]] (which requires no license of any kind to carry a concealed weapon by anyone who is not prohibited by law), could unwittingly travel into the adjacent state of New York, where such individual, despite acting entirely within the law of Vermont, would then face a mandatory 3.5 year prison sentence simply for accidentally crossing the state's border into New York. These circumstances are aggravated by the fact that many NYS police departments as well as the [[New York State Police]] do not recognize the protections granted federally under the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]], which was intended to prevent such prosecutions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/new-york-gun-laws/ | title=New York Gun Laws}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on violent crime==\nResearch has had mixed results, indicating variously that right-to-carry laws have no impact on violent crime, that they increase violent crime, and that they decrease violent crime.\n\nA comprehensive 2004 review of the existing literature by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] found that the results of existing studies were sensitive to the specification and time period examined, and concluded that a causal link between right-to-carry laws and crime rates cannot be shown.<ref name=\":3\" /> Quinnipiac University economist Mark Gius summarized literature published between 1993 and 2005, and found that ten papers suggested that permissive CCW laws reduce crime, one paper suggested they increase crime, and nine papers showed no definitive results.<ref name=\"Gius2016\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaCKDQAAQBAJ&pg=SA5-PA23|title=Guns and Crime: The Data Don't Lie|last=Gius|first=Mark|date=2016-11-03|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781315450872|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref> A 2017 review of the existing literature concluded, \"Given the most recent evidence, we conclude with considerable confidence that deregulation of gun carrying over the last four decades has undermined public safety\u2014which is to say that restricting concealed carry is one gun regulation that appears to be effective.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Philip J.

Six incidents were successfully ended when citizens intervened. In two stops citizens restrained the shooters, one unarmed, one with pepper spray. In two stops at schools, the shooters were confronted by teachers: one shooter disarmed, one committed suicide. In two stops citizens with firearms permits exchanged gunfire with the shooter. In a failed stop attempt, a citizen with a firearms permit was killed by the shooter.<ref>[https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/activeshooterincidentsus_2014-2015.pdf Schweit, Katherine W., \"Active Shooter Incidents in the United States in 2014 and 2015\", Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2016.]</ref> In 2018 the FBI analyzed 50 active shooter incidents in 2016 and 2017. This report focused on policies to neutralize active shooters to save lives. In 10 incidents citizens confronted an active shooter. In eight incidents the citizens stopped the shooter. Four stops involved unarmed citizens who confronted and restrained or blocked the shooter or talked the shooter into surrender. Four stops involved citizens with firearms permits: two exchanged gunfire with a shooter and two detained the shooter at gunpoint for arrest by responding police. Of the two failed stops, one involved a permit holder who exchanged gunfire with the shooter but the shooter fled and continued shooting and the other involved a permit holder who was wounded by the shooter. \"Armed and unarmed citizens engaged the shooter in 10 incidents. They safely and successfully ended the shootings in eight of those incidents. Their selfless actions likely saved many lives.\"<ref>[https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-us-2016-2017.pdf \"Active Shooter Incidents in the United States in 2016 and 2017\", Federal Bureau of Investigation, April 2018.] \"The FBI defines an active shooter as one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area. ... The active aspect of the definition inherently implies that both law enforcement personnel and citizens have the potential to affect the outcome of the event based upon their responses to the situation.\"</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[American gun ownership]]\n* [[Concealed carry]]\n* [[Defensive gun use]]\n* [[Gun control]]\n* [[Gun politics in the United States]]\n* [[Overview of gun laws by nation]]\n* [[Self-defense]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--WP is not a link farm.
