As the country's most prestigious level of football competition, the league changed format in [[2016\u201317 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2016\u201317 season]] and is contested by 12 clubs with the last two teams relegated at the end of every season.\n\nThe League is, as of season 2019\u201320, represented by four clubs in European competition. The winner of the Premier League starts from the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] first qualifying round. The winner of the [[Football Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as well as the runner up and third placed team on table starts from the first qualifying round of the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].\n\nAt the end of the season, the bottom two teams are relegated while winners of the [[First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]] are promoted to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==History==\n===War period 1992\u20131996===\nAfter the breakup of Yugoslavia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] proclaimed independence in late winter 1992, and already in April the same year [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina|N/FSBiH]] applied for membership with FIFA and UEFA.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\">{{cite web|title=N/FSBiH History|url=http://www.nfsbih.ba/en/tekst.php?id=7|website=www.nfsbih.ba|publisher=N/FSBiH|accessdate=27 December 2016|language=en|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130213742/http://www.nfsbih.ba/en/tekst.php?id=7|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Meanwhile, due to the outbreak of [[Bosnian War]] in April 1992 no games were played in the 1992\u201393 season. In late 1993 some parts of the country re-launched football competitions with reduced scope. But just as the country was divided along ethnic lines, so was football.\n\nIn 1993 [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]] launched  the [[Football Federation of Herzeg Bosnia]] and its [[First League of Herzeg-Bosnia]], in which only Croatian clubs competed on parochial scale within the limits of [[West Herzegovina]] and few other enclaves. In the same year [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] also organized their own [[First League of the Republika Srpska]], on a territory held by Republika Srpska regime at the time.\nOnly football on a territory under the control of then [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] institutions and auspices of N/FSBiH, at the time consequently with [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] majority, apart from a brief competition for the season [[1994\u201395 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1994\u201395]] (won by [[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]]), came to a standstill. \nCompetition under auspices of N/FSBiH did not resume until [[1995\u201396 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1995\u201396]] season when the [[First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was launched.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\"/>\n\n===Post-war period 1996\u20132000===\nThese three separate football leagues were operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1998, and 2000. Since FIFA and UEFA showed support only for the association operating under patronage of the official and internationally recognized state institutions, during the war and prior to ''[[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Agreement]]'' as well as after its signage, they endorsed unification of all three organizations as N/FSBiH. This also came as a consequence of FIFA decision to recognize N/FSBiH already in July 1996, while in the same year UEFA admitted N/FSBiH as an adjacent member until 1998 when they recognized its full membership. This meant that only N/FSBiH clubs and its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|national team]] could compete at the international and official level.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\"/>\n\nFinal unification has been preceded by several stages. At first was created a playoff where clubs were playing for the champion under N/FSBiH auspices. Idea was that playoff under unified N/FSBiH auspices should bring together clubs competing under three separate organizations for the first time but was rejected by Serb association, leaving clubs from Croat football association and N/FSBiH participating playoff for the seasons [[1997\u201398 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1997\u201398]] and [[1999\u20132000 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1999\u201300]], while [[1998\u201399 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1998\u201399]] playoff was canceled due to Croat's association hesitation on the decision on which stadiums games should be played. Next season playoff was resumed for the last time prior to full and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH ''(Premijer Liga)'', in the fall 2000.\n\n===Premier League creation 2000\u201301===\nFull and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH ''(Premijer Liga)'', happened in the fall 2000. However, the first [[2000\u201301 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2000\u201301]] season seen clubs from [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation of BiH]] only, while clubs from Republic of Srpska entity continue to compete in their own separate league as their entity association still refused to join agreed unified N/FSBiH and its new competition. However, UEFA and FIFA never intended to recognize this separate organization nor its competition, which meant clubs couldn't compete outside territory of the entity and wouldn't see any international football. This situation forced clubs to insist that their organization also join N/FSBiH, and two years later they became part of the competition for the season [[2002\u201303 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2002\u201303]]. Ever since the year 2000 Premier League is the top tier of Bosnia and Herzegovina football, with two entity-based leagues, First League of Republika Srpska and First League of the Federation of BiH, being pushed to the second tier of the football pyramid and serve as feeder leagues to Premier League.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\"/>\n\n===Premier League as Liga 12 2016\u201317 till 2017\u201318===\nDuring the [[2016\u201317 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2016\u201317 season]] and the [[2017\u201318 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2017\u201318 season]] BH Telecom Premier League had changed its format entirely, reducing a number of clubs from 16 to 12, thus sometimes referred to as '''\"Liga 12\"''' (League 12), with the calendar also modified accordingly, and introducing [[playoffs]] (also known as the ''\"title playoffs\"'') and play out.\nNumber of matches were played by each club during regular season after which, according to their position, they entered to play-offs or play out. Playoffs were contested by the top 6 clubs in the regular season, with each club playing each other twice for the title, which guarantees [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualifications, second and third place, guaranteeing [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] qualifications berths. Play out was contested by six clubs to avoid relegation with last two teams being relegated.\n\n===Old format since 2018\u201319===\nSince the [[2018\u201319 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2018\u201319 season]], the league is not played as the last two seasons before. Actually very simple, after all the 12 clubs have played each other two times, once home and once away, they will play each other three times, also playing home or away depending on how the schedule is made. With that, the league season has 33 full rounds instead of the 22 rounds and an additional 10 rounds in the relegation and championship games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/premijer-liga-bih-se-igra-u-trokruznom-formatu-broj-stranih-igraca-smanjen-na-cetiri/180619057|title=Premijer liga BiH se igra u trokru\u017enom formatu, broj stranih igra\u010da smanjen na \u010detiri|date=19 June 2018|accessdate=19 June 2018|language=Bosnian|author=E.B.|publisher=Klix.ba}}</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship==\nOn 31 July 2012, Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a two-year deal with [[BH Telecom]] regarding the sponsorship of the league, effectively renaming the league '''BH Telecom Premier League'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=BH Telecom the first ever sponsor of the Premier League, signing a two year deal!|url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/bh-telecom-sponzor-premijer-lige/85135|publisher=SportSport.ba|accessdate=31 July 2012|language=Bosnian}}</ref> The deal was extended once more before the start of 2014\u201315 season.\n\n==2019\u201320 Member Clubs==\n{{Location map+|Bosnia and Herzegovina|float=right   |width=390      |caption=Locations of the 2019\u201320 Premier League of BiH clubs|places=\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=44.205727 |long=17.907178 |label=[[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik]]}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=44.508807 |long=18.752773 |label=[[FK Sloboda Tuzla|Sloboda]]<br>[[FK Tuzla City|Tuzla City]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=44.113660 |long=18.117724 |label=[[FK Mladost Doboj Kakanj|Mladost]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=44.754353 |long=19.225034 |label=[[FK Radnik Bijeljina|Radnik]]|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=43.873697 |long=18.408633 |label=[[FK Sarajevo|Sarajevo]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=43.378688 |long=17.597962 |label=[[NK \u0160iroki Brijeg|\u0160iroki Brijeg]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=44.75     |long=19.216    |label=[[FK Zvijezda 09|Zvijezda 09]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=43.378360 |long=17.854413 |label=[[FK Vele\u017e Mostar|Vele\u017e]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=43.345560 |long=17.795308 |label=[[H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski]]|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=43.846521 |long=18.387336 |label=[[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Bosnia and Herzegovina|lat=44.775970 |long=17.199611 |label=[[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac]]|position=top}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

football|football]] [[Bosnia and Herzegovina football league system|league]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and is operated by the [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. As the country's most prestigious level of football competition, the league changed format in [[2016\u201317 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2016\u201317 season]] and is contested by 12 clubs with the last two teams relegated at the end of every season.\n\nThe League is, as of season 2019\u201320, represented by four clubs in European competition. The winner of the Premier League starts from the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] first qualifying round. The winner of the [[Football Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as well as the runner up and third placed team on table starts from the first qualifying round of the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].\n\nAt the end of the season, the bottom two teams are relegated while winners of the [[First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]] are promoted to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==History==\n===War period 1992\u20131996===\nAfter the breakup of Yugoslavia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] proclaimed independence in late winter 1992, and already in April the same year [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina|N/FSBiH]] applied for membership with FIFA and UEFA.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\">{{cite web|title=N/FSBiH History|url=http://www.nfsbih.ba/en/tekst.php?id=7|website=www.nfsbih.ba|publisher=N/FSBiH|accessdate=27 December 2016|language=en|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130213742/http://www.nfsbih.ba/en/tekst.php?id=7|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Meanwhile, due to the outbreak of [[Bosnian War]] in April 1992 no games were played in the 1992\u201393 season. In late 1993 some parts of the country re-launched football competitions with reduced scope. But just as the country was divided along ethnic lines, so was football.\n\nIn 1993 [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]] launched  the [[Football Federation of Herzeg Bosnia]] and its [[First League of Herzeg-Bosnia]], in which only Croatian clubs competed on parochial scale within the limits of [[West Herzegovina]] and few other enclaves. In the same year [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] also organized their own [[First League of the Republika Srpska]], on a territory held by Republika Srpska regime at the time.\nOnly football on a territory under the control of then [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] institutions and auspices of N/FSBiH, at the time consequently with [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] majority, apart from a brief competition for the season [[1994\u201395 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1994\u201395]] (won by [[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]]), came to a standstill. \nCompetition under auspices of N/FSBiH did not resume until [[1995\u201396 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1995\u201396]] season when the [[First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was launched.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\"/>\n\n===Post-war period 1996\u20132000===\nThese three separate football leagues were operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1998, and 2000. Since FIFA and UEFA showed support only for the association operating under patronage of the official and internationally recognized state institutions, during the war and prior to ''[[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Agreement]]'' as well as after its signage, they endorsed unification of all three organizations as N/FSBiH. This also came as a consequence of FIFA decision to recognize N/FSBiH already in July 1996, while in the same year UEFA admitted N/FSBiH as an adjacent member until 1998 when they recognized its full membership. This meant that only N/FSBiH clubs and its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|national team]] could compete at the international and official level.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\"/>\n\nFinal unification has been preceded by several stages. At first was created a playoff where clubs were playing for the champion under N/FSBiH auspices. Idea was that playoff under unified N/FSBiH auspices should bring together clubs competing under three separate organizations for the first time but was rejected by Serb association, leaving clubs from Croat football association and N/FSBiH participating playoff for the seasons [[1997\u201398 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1997\u201398]] and [[1999\u20132000 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1999\u201300]], while [[1998\u201399 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1998\u201399]] playoff was canceled due to Croat's association hesitation on the decision on which stadiums games should be played. Next season playoff was resumed for the last time prior to full and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH ''(Premijer Liga)'', in the fall 2000.\n\n===Premier League creation 2000\u201301===\nFull and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH ''(Premijer Liga)'', happened in the fall 2000. However, the first [[2000\u201301 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2000\u201301]] season seen clubs from [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation of BiH]] only, while clubs from Republic of Srpska entity continue to compete in their own separate league as their entity association still refused to join agreed unified N/FSBiH and its new competition. However, UEFA and FIFA never intended to recognize this separate organization nor its competition, which meant clubs couldn't compete outside territory of the entity and wouldn't see any international football. This situation forced clubs to insist that their organization also join N/FSBiH, and two years later they became part of the competition for the season [[2002\u201303 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2002\u201303]]. Ever since the year 2000 Premier League is the top tier of Bosnia and Herzegovina football, with two entity-based leagues, First League of Republika Srpska and First League of the Federation of BiH, being pushed to the second tier of the football pyramid and serve as feeder leagues to Premier League.<ref name=\"N-FSBiH History\"/>\n\n===Premier League as Liga 12 2016\u201317 till 2017\u201318===\nDuring the [[2016\u201317 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2016\u201317 season]] and the [[2017\u201318 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2017\u201318 season]] BH Telecom Premier League had changed its format entirely, reducing a number of clubs from 16 to 12, thus sometimes referred to as '''\"Liga 12\"''' (League 12), with the calendar also modified accordingly, and introducing [[playoffs]] (also known as the ''\"title playoffs\"'') and play out.\nNumber of matches were played by each club during regular season after which, according to their position, they entered to play-offs or play out. Playoffs were contested by the top 6 clubs in the regular season, with each club playing each other twice for the title, which guarantees [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualifications, second and third place, guaranteeing [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] qualifications berths. Play out was contested by six clubs to avoid relegation with last two teams being relegated.\n===Old format since 2018\u201319===\nSince the [[2018\u201319 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2018\u201319 season]], the league is not played as the last two seasons before. Actually very simple, after all the 12 clubs have played each other two times, once home and once away, they will play each other three times, also playing home or away depending on how the schedule is made.

After big wins over [[\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Akraness|\u00cdA Akraness]] and [[Lillestr\u00f8m SK|Lillestr\u00f8m]], however they were held by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. In the first match, held in Sarajevo, Newcastle won 0\u20131 with English team defeating \u017deljezni\u010dar 4\u20130 in England.\n\nThe second time a Bosnian club moved into the last qualifying round of the [[UEFA Champions League]] was [[FK Sarajevo]] in [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|2007\u201308]], when they lost to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] 0\u20134 on aggregate, after going over Maltese [[Marsaxlokk F.C.|Marsaxlokk]] and Belgian side [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]].\n\nAnother remarkable season for Bosnian clubs in Europe was 2009\u201310. The most memorable performances were marked by [[FK Sarajevo]] and [[FK Slavija Sarajevo|Slavija]]. While Slavija surprisingly beat [[AaB Fodbold|Aalborg]] in the Second Qualifying round but couldn't overcome [[FC VSS Ko\u0161ice|MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in the third round, [[FK Sarajevo]] was able to reach the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|Play-offs]] for the Group Stage of the newly formed [[UEFA Europa League]] after beating [[FC Spartak Trnava|Spartak Trnava]] and [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]]. However, they lost there unhappily 3\u20132 on aggregate to [[CFR Cluj]]. [[FK Sarajevo]] made it again in [[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round#Matches 3|2014\u201315]] [[UEFA Europa League]] playing all the way to the play-off round where

{"title_page": "Shortcut (computing)", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Computer shortcut|other uses|Keyboard shortcut}}\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''file shortcut''' is a [[Handle (computing)|handle]] in a [[user interface]] that allows the user to find a file or [[System resource|resource]] located in a different [[Directory (computing)|directory]] or [[Folder (computing)|folder]] from the place where the shortcut is located. Similarly, an '''Internet shortcut''' allows the user to open a page, file or resource located at a remote Internet location or Web site.\n\nShortcuts are typically implemented as a small file containing a target [[URI]] or [[Globally unique identifier|GUID]] to an ''object'', or the name of a target program file that the shortcut represents.

The relative ease of retrieving the sequence, and variability mixed with conservation between species, are some of the benefits of COI. Calling the profiles \"barcodes\", Hebert ''et al.'' envisaged the development of a COI database that could serve as the basis for a \"global bioidentification system\".\n\n*\n\n== Methodology ==\n=== Sampling and preservation ===\nBarcoding can be done from tissue from a target specimen, from a mixture of organisms (bulk sample), or from DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil). The methods for sampling, preservation or analysis differ between those different types of sample.\n\n'''Tissue samples'''\n\nTo barcode a tissue sample from the target specimen, a small piece of skin, a scale, a leg or antenna is likely to be sufficient (depending on the size of the specimen). To avoid contamination, it is necessary to sterilize used tools between samples. It is recommended to collect two samples from one specimen, one to archive, and one for the barcoding process. Sample preservation is crucial to overcome the issue of DNA degradation.\n\n'''Bulk samples'''\n\nA bulk sample is a type of environmental sample containing several organisms from the [[taxonomic group]] under study. The difference between bulk samples (in the sense used here) and other environmental samples is that the bulk sample usually provides a large quantity of good-quality DNA.<ref name=\":15\" /> Examples of bulk samples include aquatic macroinvertebrate sample collected by kick-net, or insect samples collected with a Malaise trap. Filtered or size-fractionated water samples containing whole organisms like unicellular eukaryotes are also sometimes defined as bulk samples. Such samples can be collected by the same techniques as used to obtain traditional samples for morphology-based identification.\n\n'''eDNA samples'''\n\nThe [[environmental DNA]] (eDNA) method is a non-invasive approach to detect and identify species from cellular debris or extracellular DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil) through barcoding or metabarcoding. The approach is based on the fact that every living organism leave DNA in the environment, and this environmental DNA can be detected even for organisms that are at very low abundance. Thus, for field sampling, the most crucial part is to use DNA-free material and tools on each sampling site or sample to avoid contamination, if the DNA of the target organism(s) is likely to be present in low quantities. On the other hand, an eDNA sample always includes the DNA of whole-cell, living microorganisms, which are often present in large quantities. Therefore, microorganism samples taken in the natural environment also are called eDNA samples, but contamination is less problematic in this context due to the large quantity of target organisms. The eDNA method is applied on most sample types, like water, sediment, soil, animal feces, stomach content or blood from e.g. leeches.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jelger Herder|title=Environmental DNA - a review of the possible applications for the detection of (invasive) species.|date=2014|publisher=RAVON|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4002.1208|last2=A.

These databases contain the DNA barcodes assigned to previously identified taxa. Most reference libraries do not cover all species within an organism group, and new entries are continually created. In the case of macro- and many microorganisms (such as algae), these reference libraries require detailed documentation (sampling location and date, person who collected it, image, etc.) and authoritative taxonomic identification of the voucher specimen, as well as submission of sequences in a particular format. The process also requires the storage of voucher specimens in museum collections and other collaborating institutions.

Diat.barcode provides data for two genetic markers, ''rbc''L (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and 18S (18S ribosomal RNA). The database also involves additional, trait information of species, like morphological characteristics (biovolume, size dimensions, etc.), life-forms (mobility, colony-type, etc.) or ecological features (pollution sensitivity, etc.).\n\n=== Bioinformatic analysis ===\nIn order to obtain well structured, clean and interpretable data, raw sequencing data must be processed using bioinformatic analysis. The [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]] file with the sequencing data contains two types of information: the sequences detected in the sample ([[FASTA format|FASTA]] file) and a quality file with quality scores ([[Phred quality score|PHRED]] scores) associated with each nucleotide of each DNA sequence. The PHRED scores indicate the probability with which the associated nucleotide has been correctly scored.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PHRED quality score and the associated certainty level\n|10\n|90%\n|-\n|20\n|99%\n|-\n|30\n|99.9%\n|-\n|40\n|99.99%\n|-\n|50\n|99.999%\n|}\nIn general, the PHRED score decreases towards the end of each DNA sequence. Thus some bioinformatics pipelines simply cut the end of the sequences at a defined threshold.\n\nSome sequencing technologies, like MiSeq, use paired-end sequencing during which sequencing is performed from both directions producing better quality. The overlapping sequences are then aligned into contigs and merged. Usually, several samples are pooled in one run, and each sample is characterized by a short DNA fragment, the tag. In a demultiplexing step, sequences are sorted using these tags to reassemble the separate samples. Before further analysis, tags and other adapters are removed from the barcoding sequence DNA fragment. During trimming, the bad quality sequences (low PHRED scores), or sequences that are much shorter or longer than the targeted DNA barcode, are removed. The following dereplication step is the process where all of the quality-filtered sequences are collapsed into a set of unique reads (individual sequence units ISUs) with the information of their abundance in the samples. After that, chimeras (i.e. compound sequences formed from pieces of mixed origin) are detected and removed.

However, DNA barcoding could improve traditional methods for the following reasons; DNA barcoding (i) can increase taxonomic resolution and harmonize the identification of taxa which are difficult to identify or lack experts, (ii) can more accurately/precisely relate environmental factors to specific taxa (iii) can increase comparability among regions, (iv) allows for the inclusion of early life stages and fragmented specimens, (v) allows delimitation of [[Species complex|cryptic]]/rare species (vi) allows for development of new indices e.g. rare/cryptic species which may be sensitive/tolerant to [[stressor]]s, (vii) increases the number of samples which can be processed and reduces processing time resulting in increased knowledge of species ecology, (viii) is a non-invasive way of monitoring when using [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apoth\u00e9loz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agn\u00e8s|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=637-638|pages=1295\u20131310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|bibcode=2018ScTEn.637.1295P}}</ref>\n\n==== Time and cost ====\nDNA barcoding is faster than traditional morphological methods all the way from training through to taxonomic assignment. It takes less time to gain expertise in DNA methods than becoming an expert in taxonomy. In addition, the DNA barcoding workflow (i.e. from sample to result) is generally quicker than traditional morphological workflow and allows the processing of more samples.\n\n==== Taxonomic resolution ====\nDNA barcoding allows the resolution of taxa from higher (e.g. family) to lower (e.g. species) taxonomic levels, that are otherwise too difficult to identify using traditional morphological methods, like e.g. identification via microscopy. For example, [[Chironomidae]] (the non-biting midge) are widely distributed in both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Their richness and abundance make them important for ecological processes and networks, and they are one of many invertebrate groups used in biomonitoring. Invertebrate samples can contain as many as 100 species of chironomids which often make up as much as 50% of a sample.

For example, detecting target DNA in aquatic systems depends on the concentration of DNA molecules at a site, which in turn can be affected by many factors. The presence of DNA molecules also depends on dispersion at a site, e.g. direction or strength of currents. It is not really known how DNA moves around in streams and lakes, which makes sampling difficult. Another factor might be the behavior of the target species, e.g. fish can have seasonal changes of movements, crayfish or mussels will release DNA in larger amounts just at certain times of their life (moulting, spawning). For DNA in soil, even less is known about distribution, quantity or quality.\n\n==== Incomplete barcode reference libraries ====\nThe major limitation of the barcoding method is that it relies on barcode reference libraries for the taxonomic identification of the sequences. The taxonomic identification is accurate only if a reliable reference is available. However, most databases are still incomplete, especially for smaller organisms e.g. fungi, phytoplankton, nematoda etc. In addition, current databases contain misidentifications, spelling mistakes and other errors. There is massive curation and completion effort around the databases for all organisms necessary, involving large barcoding projects (for example the iBOL project for the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) reference database).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibol.org/|title=The International Barcode of Life Consortium|website=International Barcode of Life|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boldsystems.org/|title=Bold Systems v4|website=www.boldsystems.org|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> However, completion and curation are difficult and time-consuming. Without vouchered specimens, there can be no certainty about whether the sequence used as a reference is correct. DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to [[Zoological specimen#Voucher specimens|vouchered specimens]] (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schander|first=Christoffer|last2=Willassen|first2=Endre|date=2005|title=What can biological barcoding do for marine biology?|journal=Marine Biology Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79\u201383|doi=10.1080/17451000510018962|issn=1745-1000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.

The parameters of bioinformatics [[Bioinformatics workflow management system|pipelines]] (for example OTU clustering, taxonomic assignment algorithms or thresholds etc.) are at the origin of much debate among DNA barcoding users.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\"/> Sequencing technologies are also rapidly evolving, together with the tools for the analysis of the massive amounts of DNA data generated, and standardization of the methods is urgently needed to enable collaboration and data sharing at greater spatial and time-scale. This standardisation of barcoding methods at the European scale is part of the objectives of the European COST Action DNAqua-net <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnaqua.net/|title=DNAquaNet|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> and is also addressed by CEN (the European Committee for Standardization).<ref>CEN (2018) CEN/TC 230/WORKING GROUP 2 \u2013 Proposal for a new Working Group WG28 ''\u201cDNA and eDNA methods\u201d A plan to fulfil the DNA and eDNA standardization needs of EU legislation in Water Policy'' (Proposal following decisions of the 2017 Berlin Meeting of CEN/TC 230, its Working Groups and eDNA COST representatives)</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of DNA barcoding is its limited efficiency for accurate discrimination below species level (for example, to distinguish between varieties), for hybrid detection, and that it can be affected by evolutionary rates (Ref needed).\n\n==== Mismatches between conventional (morphological) and barcode based identification ====\nIt is important to know that taxa lists derived by conventional (morphological) identification are not, and maybe never will be, directly comparable to taxa lists derived from barcode based iendtification because of several reasons. The most important cause is probably the incompleteness and lack of accuracy of the molecular reference databases preventing a correct taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. Taxa not present in reference databases will not be found by eDNA, and sequences linked to a wrong name will lead to incorrect identification.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other known causes are a different sampling scale and size between a traditional and a molecular sample, the possible analysis of dead organisms, which can happen in different ways for both methods depending on organism group, and the specific selection of identification in either method, i.e. varying taxonomical expertise or possibility to identify certain organism groups, respectively primer bias leading also to a potential biased analysis of taxa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Estimates of richness/diversity ====\nDNA Barcoding can result in an over or underestimate of species richness and diversity.

The relative ease of retrieving the sequence, and variability mixed with conservation between species, are some of the benefits of COI. Calling the profiles \"barcodes\", Hebert ''et al.'' envisaged the development of a COI database that could serve as the basis for a \"global bioidentification system\".\n\n*\n\n== Methodology ==\n=== Sampling and preservation ===\nBarcoding can be done from tissue from a target specimen, from a mixture of organisms (bulk sample), or from DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil). The methods for sampling, preservation or analysis differ between those different types of sample.\n\n'''Tissue samples'''\n\nTo barcode a tissue sample from the target specimen, a small piece of skin, a scale, a leg or antenna is likely to be sufficient (depending on the size of the specimen). To avoid contamination, it is necessary to sterilize used tools between samples. It is recommended to collect two samples from one specimen, one to archive, and one for the barcoding process. Sample preservation is crucial to overcome the issue of DNA degradation.\n\n'''Bulk samples'''\n\nA bulk sample is a type of environmental sample containing several organisms from the [[taxonomic group]] under study. The difference between bulk samples (in the sense used here) and other environmental samples is that the bulk sample usually provides a large quantity of good-quality DNA.<ref name=\":15\" /> Examples of bulk samples include aquatic macroinvertebrate sample collected by kick-net, or insect samples collected with a Malaise trap. Filtered or size-fractionated water samples containing whole organisms like unicellular eukaryotes are also sometimes defined as bulk samples. Such samples can be collected by the same techniques as used to obtain traditional samples for morphology-based identification.\n\n'''eDNA samples'''\n\nThe [[environmental DNA]] (eDNA) method is a non-invasive approach to detect and identify species from cellular debris or extracellular DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil) through barcoding or metabarcoding. The approach is based on the fact that every living organism leave DNA in the environment, and this environmental DNA can be detected even for organisms that are at very low abundance. Thus, for field sampling, the most crucial part is to use DNA-free material and tools on each sampling site or sample to avoid contamination, if the DNA of the target organism(s) is likely to be present in low quantities. On the other hand, an eDNA sample always includes the DNA of whole-cell, living microorganisms, which are often present in large quantities. Therefore, microorganism samples taken in the natural environment also are called eDNA samples, but contamination is less problematic in this context due to the large quantity of target organisms. The eDNA method is applied on most sample types, like water, sediment, soil, animal feces, stomach content or blood from e.g. leeches.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jelger Herder|title=Environmental DNA - a review of the possible applications for the detection of (invasive) species.|date=2014|publisher=RAVON|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4002.1208|last2=A.

Several different [[DNA extraction]] methods exist, and factors like cost, time, sample type and yield affect the selection of the optimal method.\n\nWhen DNA from organismal or eDNA samples is amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the reaction can be affected negatively by inhibitor molecules contained in the sample.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Schrader|first=C.|last2=Schielke|first2=A.|last3=Ellerbroek|first3=L.|last4=Johne|first4=R.|date=2012|title=PCR inhibitors \u2013 occurrence, properties and removal|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=113|issue=5|pages=1014\u20131026|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05384.x|pmid=22747964|issn=1365-2672}}</ref> Removal of these inhibitors is crucial to ensure that high quality DNA is available for subsequent analyzing.\n\n[[Gene amplification|Amplification]] of the extracted DNA is a required step in DNA barcoding.

These databases contain the DNA barcodes assigned to previously identified taxa. Most reference libraries do not cover all species within an organism group, and new entries are continually created. In the case of macro- and many microorganisms (such as algae), these reference libraries require detailed documentation (sampling location and date, person who collected it, image, etc.) and authoritative taxonomic identification of the voucher specimen, as well as submission of sequences in a particular format. The process also requires the storage of voucher specimens in museum collections and other collaborating institutions.

Diat.barcode provides data for two genetic markers, ''rbc''L (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and 18S (18S ribosomal RNA). The database also involves additional, trait information of species, like morphological characteristics (biovolume, size dimensions, etc.), life-forms (mobility, colony-type, etc.) or ecological features (pollution sensitivity, etc.).\n\n=== Bioinformatic analysis ===\nIn order to obtain well structured, clean and interpretable data, raw sequencing data must be processed using bioinformatic analysis. The [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]] file with the sequencing data contains two types of information: the sequences detected in the sample ([[FASTA format|FASTA]] file) and a quality file with quality scores ([[Phred quality score|PHRED]] scores) associated with each nucleotide of each DNA sequence. The PHRED scores indicate the probability with which the associated nucleotide has been correctly scored.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PHRED quality score and the associated certainty level\n|10\n|90%\n|-\n|20\n|99%\n|-\n|30\n|99.9%\n|-\n|40\n|99.99%\n|-\n|50\n|99.999%\n|}\nIn general, the PHRED score decreases towards the end of each DNA sequence. Thus some bioinformatics pipelines simply cut the end of the sequences at a defined threshold.\n\nSome sequencing technologies, like MiSeq, use paired-end sequencing during which sequencing is performed from both directions producing better quality. The overlapping sequences are then aligned into contigs and merged. Usually, several samples are pooled in one run, and each sample is characterized by a short DNA fragment, the tag. In a demultiplexing step, sequences are sorted using these tags to reassemble the separate samples. Before further analysis, tags and other adapters are removed from the barcoding sequence DNA fragment. During trimming, the bad quality sequences (low PHRED scores), or sequences that are much shorter or longer than the targeted DNA barcode, are removed. The following dereplication step is the process where all of the quality-filtered sequences are collapsed into a set of unique reads (individual sequence units ISUs) with the information of their abundance in the samples. After that, chimeras (i.e. compound sequences formed from pieces of mixed origin) are detected and removed.

However, DNA barcoding could improve traditional methods for the following reasons; DNA barcoding (i) can increase taxonomic resolution and harmonize the identification of taxa which are difficult to identify or lack experts, (ii) can more accurately/precisely relate environmental factors to specific taxa (iii) can increase comparability among regions, (iv) allows for the inclusion of early life stages and fragmented specimens, (v) allows delimitation of [[Species complex|cryptic]]/rare species (vi) allows for development of new indices e.g. rare/cryptic species which may be sensitive/tolerant to [[stressor]]s, (vii) increases the number of samples which can be processed and reduces processing time resulting in increased knowledge of species ecology, (viii) is a non-invasive way of monitoring when using [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apoth\u00e9loz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agn\u00e8s|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=637-638|pages=1295\u20131310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|bibcode=2018ScTEn.637.1295P}}</ref>\n\n==== Time and cost ====\nDNA barcoding is faster than traditional morphological methods all the way from training through to taxonomic assignment. It takes less time to gain expertise in DNA methods than becoming an expert in taxonomy. In addition, the DNA barcoding workflow (i.e. from sample to result) is generally quicker than traditional morphological workflow and allows the processing of more samples.\n\n==== Taxonomic resolution ====\nDNA barcoding allows the resolution of taxa from higher (e.g. family) to lower (e.g. species) taxonomic levels, that are otherwise too difficult to identify using traditional morphological methods, like e.g. identification via microscopy. For example, [[Chironomidae]] (the non-biting midge) are widely distributed in both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Their richness and abundance make them important for ecological processes and networks, and they are one of many invertebrate groups used in biomonitoring. Invertebrate samples can contain as many as 100 species of chironomids which often make up as much as 50% of a sample.

For example, detecting target DNA in aquatic systems depends on the concentration of DNA molecules at a site, which in turn can be affected by many factors. The presence of DNA molecules also depends on dispersion at a site, e.g. direction or strength of currents. It is not really known how DNA moves around in streams and lakes, which makes sampling difficult. Another factor might be the behavior of the target species, e.g. fish can have seasonal changes of movements, crayfish or mussels will release DNA in larger amounts just at certain times of their life (moulting, spawning). For DNA in soil, even less is known about distribution, quantity or quality.\n\n==== Incomplete barcode reference libraries ====\nThe major limitation of the barcoding method is that it relies on barcode reference libraries for the taxonomic identification of the sequences. The taxonomic identification is accurate only if a reliable reference is available. However, most databases are still incomplete, especially for smaller organisms e.g. fungi, phytoplankton, nematoda etc. In addition, current databases contain misidentifications, spelling mistakes and other errors. There is massive curation and completion effort around the databases for all organisms necessary, involving large barcoding projects (for example the iBOL project for the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) reference database).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibol.org/|title=The International Barcode of Life Consortium|website=International Barcode of Life|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boldsystems.org/|title=Bold Systems v4|website=www.boldsystems.org|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> However, completion and curation are difficult and time-consuming. Without vouchered specimens, there can be no certainty about whether the sequence used as a reference is correct. DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to [[Zoological specimen#Voucher specimens|vouchered specimens]] (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schander|first=Christoffer|last2=Willassen|first2=Endre|date=2005|title=What can biological barcoding do for marine biology?|journal=Marine Biology Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79\u201383|doi=10.1080/17451000510018962|issn=1745-1000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.

The parameters of bioinformatics [[Bioinformatics workflow management system|pipelines]] (for example OTU clustering, taxonomic assignment algorithms or thresholds etc.) are at the origin of much debate among DNA barcoding users.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\"/> Sequencing technologies are also rapidly evolving, together with the tools for the analysis of the massive amounts of DNA data generated, and standardization of the methods is urgently needed to enable collaboration and data sharing at greater spatial and time-scale. This standardisation of barcoding methods at the European scale is part of the objectives of the European COST Action DNAqua-net <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnaqua.net/|title=DNAquaNet|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> and is also addressed by CEN (the European Committee for Standardization).<ref>CEN (2018) CEN/TC 230/WORKING GROUP 2 \u2013 Proposal for a new Working Group WG28 ''\u201cDNA and eDNA methods\u201d A plan to fulfil the DNA and eDNA standardization needs of EU legislation in Water Policy'' (Proposal following decisions of the 2017 Berlin Meeting of CEN/TC 230, its Working Groups and eDNA COST representatives)</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of DNA barcoding is its limited efficiency for accurate discrimination below species level (for example, to distinguish between varieties), for hybrid detection, and that it can be affected by evolutionary rates (Ref needed).\n\n==== Mismatches between conventional (morphological) and barcode based identification ====\nIt is important to know that taxa lists derived by conventional (morphological) identification are not, and maybe never will be, directly comparable to taxa lists derived from barcode based iendtification because of several reasons. The most important cause is probably the incompleteness and lack of accuracy of the molecular reference databases preventing a correct taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. Taxa not present in reference databases will not be found by eDNA, and sequences linked to a wrong name will lead to incorrect identification.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other known causes are a different sampling scale and size between a traditional and a molecular sample, the possible analysis of dead organisms, which can happen in different ways for both methods depending on organism group, and the specific selection of identification in either method, i.e. varying taxonomical expertise or possibility to identify certain organism groups, respectively primer bias leading also to a potential biased analysis of taxa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Estimates of richness/diversity ====\nDNA Barcoding can result in an over or underestimate of species richness and diversity.

While DNA barcoding points to find a specific species, metabarcoding looks for the whole community.|478x478px]]DNA metabarcoding is defined as the barcoding of [[DNA]] or [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] (environmental DNA) that allows for simultaneous identification of many taxa within the same (environmental) sample, however often within the same organism group. The main difference between the approaches is that metabarcoding, in contrast to barcoding, does not focus on one specific organism, but instead aims to determine species composition within a sample.\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe metabarcoding procedure, like general barcoding, covers the steps of [[DNA extraction]], [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification]], [[sequencing]] and [[data analysis]]. A barcode consists of a short variable [[gene]] region (for example, see [[Algae DNA barcoding#Target regions|different markers/barcodes]]) which is useful for taxonomic assignment flanked by highly conserved gene regions which can be used for [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] design.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite book|title=Environmental DNA : for biodiversity research and monitoring|last=Pierre|first=Taberlet|others=Bonin, Aurelie, 1979-|isbn=9780191079993|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=1021883023|date = 2018-02-02}}</ref> Different genes are used depending if the aim is to barcode single species or metabarcoding several species.

The names Betoi and Jirara are those of two of its peoples/dialects; the language proper has no known name. At contact, Betoi was a local [[lingua franca]] spoken between the [[Uribante River|Uribante]] and [[Sarare River|Sarare]] rivers and along the [[Arauca River|Arauca]]. Enough was recorded for a brief grammatical monograph to be written (Zamponi 2003).\n\n==Classification==\nBetoi is generally seen as an isolate, though Kaufman (2007) included it in [[Macro-Paesan]].\n\nZamponi (2017) observes some lexical resemblances between Betoi and [[Piaroa\u2013Saliban languages|Saliban languages]], but considers the similarities to be due to areal influences.<ref>Zamponi, Raoul (2017).

Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to [[geocentrism]], which placed the Earth at the center. [[Aristarchus of Samos]] already proposed a heliocentric model in the third century BC. In the sixteenth century, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' presented a full discussion of a [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe <ref>{{Cite book|title = De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|last = |first = |publisher = Johannes Petreius|date = 1543|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> in much the same way as [[Ptolemy]] had presented his geocentric model in the second century. This \"[[Copernican revolution]]\" resolved the issue of planetary [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]] by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. \"Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book... had been [printed more than] a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] [[Joan Blaeu]] was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.\"<ref>[[Jerry Brotton]], ''[[A History of the World in Twelve Maps]]'', London: Allen Lane, 2012, {{ISBN|9781846140990}} p. 262.</ref>\n\n==Influence on Earth==\n{{main|Season}}\nBecause of Earth's [[axial tilt]] (often known as the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. North of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year, and continuous daylight during the opposite time of year. This is called [[polar night]] and [[midnight sun]], respectively. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the [[season]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/|title = What causes the seasons? (NASA)|accessdate = January 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Events in the orbit==\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the [[solstice]]s (the two points in the Earth's orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth's axis, toward the Sun or away from the Sun) and the [[equinox]]es (the two points in the Earth's orbit where the Earth's tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another). The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere [[winter solstice]] occurs on or about December 21; summer solstice is near June 21; spring equinox is around March 20; and autumnal equinox is about September 23.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/longest-day/equinox-solstice-2010-2019.htm|title = Date & Time of Solstices & Equinoxes|date = August 28, 2013|accessdate = Jan 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The effect of the Earth's axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere (e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).\n\nIn modern times, Earth's [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] occurs around January 3, and the [[Perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] around July 4 (for other eras, see [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] and [[Milankovitch cycles]]). The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9% <ref>Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. See \"Orbital characteristics\" table. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% of the radiation at aphelion.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}</ref> in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jack|date=2005-12-20|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wseason/wseason.htm|title=Earth's tilt creates seasons|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hill sphere]] ([[gravity|gravitational]] sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1,500,000 [[kilometer]]s (0.01 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in radius, or approximately four times the average distance to the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|author=V\u00e1zquez, M.|author2=Monta\u00f1\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, P.|author3=Palle, E.|date=2006|url= http://www.iac.es/folleto/research/preprints/files/PP06024.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Earth as an Object of Astrophysical Interest in the Search for Extrasolar Planets|publisher=Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">For the Earth, the Hill radius is\n\n:<math>R_H = a \\left(\\frac{m}{3M}\\right)^{1/3},</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the mass of the Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun.

This \"[[Copernican revolution]]\" resolved the issue of planetary [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]] by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. \"Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book... had been [printed more than] a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] [[Joan Blaeu]] was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.\"<ref>[[Jerry Brotton]], ''[[A History of the World in Twelve Maps]]'', London: Allen Lane, 2012, {{ISBN|9781846140990}} p. 262.</ref>\n\n==Influence on Earth==\n{{main|Season}}\nBecause of Earth's [[axial tilt]] (often known as the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. North of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year, and continuous daylight during the opposite time of year. This is called [[polar night]] and [[midnight sun]], respectively. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the [[season]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/|title = What causes the seasons? (NASA)|accessdate = January 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Events in the orbit==\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the [[solstice]]s (the two points in the Earth's orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth's axis, toward the Sun or away from the Sun) and the [[equinox]]es (the two points in the Earth's orbit where the Earth's tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another). The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere [[winter solstice]] occurs on or about December 21; summer solstice is near June 21; spring equinox is around March 20; and autumnal equinox is about September 23.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/longest-day/equinox-solstice-2010-2019.htm|title = Date & Time of Solstices & Equinoxes|date = August 28, 2013|accessdate = Jan 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The effect of the Earth's axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere (e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).\n\nIn modern times, Earth's [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] occurs around January 3, and the [[Perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] around July 4 (for other eras, see [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] and [[Milankovitch cycles]]). The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9% <ref>Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. See \"Orbital characteristics\" table. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% of the radiation at aphelion.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}</ref> in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jack|date=2005-12-20|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wseason/wseason.htm|title=Earth's tilt creates seasons|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hill sphere]] ([[gravity|gravitational]] sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1,500,000 [[kilometer]]s (0.01 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in radius, or approximately four times the average distance to the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|author=V\u00e1zquez, M.|author2=Monta\u00f1\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, P.|author3=Palle, E.|date=2006|url= http://www.iac.es/folleto/research/preprints/files/PP06024.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Earth as an Object of Astrophysical Interest in the Search for Extrasolar Planets|publisher=Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">For the Earth, the Hill radius is\n\n:<math>R_H = a \\left(\\frac{m}{3M}\\right)^{1/3},</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the mass of the Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun.

A mysterious shadowed figure appears to be \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" and battles against the Pink Time Force Ranger. The cadets attempt to save Professor Scotts but are unable to stop the shadowed figure from escaping in a time ship and traveling through time. Professor Scotts indicates that she has lost contact with her Ranger team and that the cadets, along with officer Jack, need to follow the shadowed figure through time while she stays in 3016 to gather information. The cadets reluctantly leave the Pink Time Force Ranger behind and activate a time ship along with robotic assistant Alpha 55, who informs them that the shadowed figure has traveled back to a city called Angel Grove in the year 1994.

Vesper and Eddie attempt to make repairs while the other Rangers experiment with the time ship's battle simulator and food replicator systems with unusual results. Eddie becomes resentful of Chloe as she grows to be close friends with Marv. Meanwhile, Vesper fashions the Hyperforce Rangers' power weapons from parts salvaged off of the time ship and Alpha 55 while developing closer feelings towards Eddie; whom she gives a present. Jack tries to discern what \"The Leader\" is plotting when the time ship receives a warning that the timeline is being altered as a villain known as Scorpina will disappear from 1994. The Hyperforce Rangers confront a disguised Scorpina at the library where Eddie is compromised by Scorpina's influence. They manage to snap Eddie out of the spell but then come under attack from Velchanos and his monsters created from the library's books and other surroundings. The Rangers destroy the book monsters, but Scorpina and Velchanos manage to escape. The Hyperforce Rangers later return to the Library in civilian form to help clean up the damage while discussing what to do next to complete their mission before the timeline is further compromised by the return of the Rangers of 1994 from outer space. Marv comes to the realization that he may not have been a good friend towards Eddie following the incident with Scorpina and privately begins to open up to him about his troubled past in Time Force and with Jack.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Aisha Campbell Returns!\n |Aux1 = [[Karan Ashley]] as Aisha Campbell, the 2nd [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Mighty Morphin]] Yellow Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|14}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers finish cleaning up the library as they ponder how to stop Scorpina and Velchanos from stealing Finster's clay when they are suddenly contacted by Zordon, who had been monitoring the situation from a distance since detecting their time ship's arrival on Halloween.

The six Rangers then travel together within the Sabretooth Tiger Griffin Thunderzord to Italy to find a depressed Finster who is feeling outcast and obsolete since Lord Zedd's arrival. The Hyperforce Rangers attempt to befriend Finster before Velchanos and Scorpina arrive, but then come under attack on two sides by Finster's Bully Putty and Velchanos's lady, fighter, and senator statue monsters. The Rangers destroy the monsters, but Velchanos is successful in stealing Finster's clay. Velchanos uses a tiny piece of clay to create the Gladiator statue monster and calls upon the dark powers of \"The Leader\" to make the monster grow to cover his and Scorpina's escape. The Hyperforce Rangers combine their powers with the Thunderzord to destroy the Gladiator, but not before some historical monuments were damaged in the attack. The Hyperforce Rangers return to Angel Grove and say their goodbyes to Aisha as Zordon recalls her back to continue her space mission with the Mighty Morphin Rangers.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = We Need Megazord Power!\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|21}}\n | ShortSummary= Alpha 55 improves upon the time ship's scanners and discovers that only three hours remain before Scorpina's disappearance from time becomes permanent. The Hyperforce Rangers continue their repairs to the time ship in hopes of tracking down Scorpina and stopping the change, but realize they don't have the necessary parts for repairs. Vesper and Eddie then attempt an alternate plan of contacting Time Force in the year 3016 instead for assistance. Zordon contacts the Hyperforce Rangers once again noting that Lord Zedd has taken advantage of the situation with the Mighty Morphin Rangers being away from the planet. As Vesper and Eddie continue to contact the future Marv, Chloe, and Jack come to Zordon's aid of evacuating civilians and confronting the dog samurai monster known as Shibarai. Lord Zedd observes the battle from his palace on the moon and sends in reinforcements with the Z-Putties. Scorpina, Velchanos and \"The Leader\" also observe the battle from their time ship but choose not to interfere as they prepare for the next phase of their plans. The Hyperforce Rangers defeat the Z-Putties and Shibari, but Zedd then makes the monster grow. Vesper and Eddie succeed in contacting Time Force and are sent the newly created Hyper Zords along with supplies for repairing their time ship. The Shibarai monster is destroyed by the Hyper Zords and the Hyperforce Rangers combine the Hyper Zords with their time ship to follow \"The Leader\" and his time ship as they slip away in a time stream outside of normal time and space. The Hyperforce Rangers' time ship is then compromised by turbulence from the other time ship along with an unknown system failure to the electronics. Alpha 55  also becomes compromised to a similar system failure as the time ship crash lands. The Hyperforce Rangers then come into contact with a person calling herself M and agree to help her and the other refugees make their way to Corinth.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Vesper's Betrayal\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|28}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers continue their trip with the refugees to make their way to Corinth. On the way there they learn more from M about the Venjix computer virus that has infected their time ship and Alpha 55's systems as well as the condition of the barren, radioactive and machine infested world they are left to traverse in. Marv, unaware that they are in a parallel reality from their own, blames himself for this apocalyptic outcome due to the Hyperforce Rangers inability to stop the alterations to the timeline. Vesper begins to question the meaning of her existence and asks Eddie out on a date after they complete their mission as Hyperforce Rangers. The Hyperforce Rangers and refugees arrive at the now abandoned ruins of Omega City and are forced to take shelter from an oncoming radioactive storm within the freezer of an old gelato store. While taking shelter they come under attack from the Grinders. The Hyperforce Rangers and M manage to fend off the robots, but the refugees are captured and dragged away. They follow the tracks left behind to a factory being commanded by the machine general known as Kilobyte. M takes cover as the Hyperforce Rangers ram their truck into the factory as a diversion. As the main Grinder force attacks Jack, Marv and Chloe, Vesper tries to take on Kilobyte while Eddie follows close behind. Kilobyte infects Vesper with the Venjix virus, revealing Vesper to be an android. Vesper, unable to control her actions, beats Eddie within an inch of his life. Marv and Chloe discover the refugees, but Chloe becomes horribly mortified when one her attacks on the Grinders goes awry and injures several of the refugees. Jack comes to Marv and Chloe's aid and explains that Eddie needs help from Vesper. Marv however distrusts Jack when Vesper radios Marv to say that Jack had attacked her and Eddie. Before Marv and Jack can sort out the issue Kilobyte springs a trap ensnaring the two along with Chloe and the refugees within a cage. A barely live Eddie is left alone to struggle against the infected Vesper.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = It's Boom Time\n |Aux1 = [[Mike Ginn]] as Gem, the [[Power Rangers RPM|RPM]] Ranger Operator Series Gold\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|12|12}}\n | ShortSummary= Venjix discusses with Kilobyte the unusual devices taken off of the captured Hyperforce Rangers and sends Shifter out to ascertain their origins as to acquire more of their technology. Meanwhile the captured Hyperforce Rangers are processed at a factory responsible for building Grinders where they meet another captor by the name of Gem. The Rangers attempt to appeal to Vesper's better nature, but to no avail much to Gem's amusement at the spectacle as he reveals to the Rangers that Vesper is a machine. As the Hyperforce Rangers discuss a plan for escape, Gem mentions that he already has a plan for escape using a device he cobbled together from the scraps of tech about the factory to disable the security. The Rangers decide to make a distraction for the escape by flipping some tables while working on the assembly lines, but things quickly go south after Gem gets a bit overzealous in table flipping and Vesper threatens to kill the badly injured Eddie. Marv quickly improvises a new distraction by intentionally gagging himself until he vomits on Vesper. With the Grinders distracted Gem and Chloe sneak off and destroy the factory's generator before elaborately flipping into the ducts leading to the research lab where medical supplies for Eddie and their Time Force devices are being held. Jack enters the lab shortly after and reacquires the Hyperforce team's morphers as well as the RPM Gold and Silver morphers for Gem. Gem quickly builds a new device allowing the Rangers to briefly enter Vesper's mind where they learn more of Vesper's past through her memories and eventually break Venjix's hold. Gem goes off to free more prisoners in a separate wing of the factory only to learn that his sister Gemma is no longer there. Before Gem and the Hyperforce Rangers can escape they come under attack from the Generation 13 Buzzsaw Attack Bot nicknamed Buzzkill. M arrives with reinforcements found near Omega City and comes to help rescue the prisoners as Venjix initiates the download to make Buzzkill grow. While the reinforcements deal with the ground forces Gem summons the RPM Falcon Zord and the Hyperforce Rangers summon the Hyperforce Zords to form the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord for the first time. With their combined powers Gem and the Hyperforce Rangers destroy Buzzkill and send Kilobyte hurdling into the distance thousands of miles away. Gem leaves to search for his sister Gemma. M and the refugees also leave to continue their trip to Corinth. Thinking Alpha 55 may have also been freed of Venjix's hold after saving Vesper, the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to contact him, but are unable to reach him. The Rangers return to the ship to find it and Alpha 55 slightly in disarray from when they were last there. Vesper, now knowing that she is an android, is able to connect herself directly to the time ship and return it to the time stream to pursue \"The Leader\" on his last known trajectory. As most of the Rangers head off to celebrate with some well earned burritos Marv reveals to Vesper in secret that he is an alien and that he can relate to her android situation as he knows what it feels like trying to fit in with others when you are different.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = Holiday Special Featuring Santa!\n |Aux1 = Zac Eubank as [[Santa Claus]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|12|19}}\n | ShortSummary= Some time has passed since the Hyperforce Rangers had resumed their mission in time. Eddie discusses with Marv and Chloe all that has happened since discovering Vesper was an android and wonders how she could keep something like that from him and the others. In the process of discussing Vesper overhears part of the conversation and states to Eddie and the others that even she was unaware until she was infected with the Venjix virus. In the same conversation Marv inadvertently outs himself as being an alien. Vesper and Chloe head off to work on repairing Alpha 55 and decide to test the full extent of Vesper's android abilities. Vesper lets Chloe know that she is intentionally avoiding Eddie partly out of guilt for hurting him and partly out of a need to focus on herself at the moment since the revelation of not being human. Chloe reveals to Vesper that she also isn't being fully honest with the other Rangers and has also been looking for her parents. Alpha 55 comes back online but before the Hyperforce Rangers can celebrate Alpha 55 warns them of an incoming magical power. Marv, Chloe, Eddie and Vesper are forcibly teleported off of the time ship to the North Pole on Christmas Eve in the year 1985, leaving Alpha 55 and Jack on board the time ship. They learn from the elf Squeezy Sparkle Toes that it was Santa who had teleported the Rangers as Christmas was being threatened by the monster [[Krampus]]. Santa explains that only the holiday spirit can truly defeat Krampus and the Hyperforce Rangers agree to help. To get into the holiday spirit the Rangers change into holiday-themed pajamas and Vesper finally gains the courage to talk to Eddie about how she is currently feeling. Eddie tells Vesper to take all the time she needs to figure things out and Vesper decides to take a chance and kisses Eddie on the cheek. Meanwhile Santa confronts Chloe and gives her some advice about being truthful with her friends, though Chloe still remains reluctant. Krampus attacks Santa's workshop with his foot soldiers created from coal known as the Naughties. Eddie fends off some of the Naughties, but Krampus manages to steal Santa's \"Naughty or Nice\" Christmas list. Santa suits up in elf created battlizer armor and he and the Hyperforce Rangers head out to retrieve back the list. Chloe and Squeezy do some reconnaissance in Krampus's hideout and cause a distraction. Santa and the Hyperforce Rangers take this opportunity to attack Krampus as he grows giant. Santa combines his battlizer with his sleigh to create a large Sleigh Zord and the Hyperforce Rangers summon their Hyperforce Zords. The Hyperforce Rangers injure Krampus and steal back the list as the constant singing causes the Naughties to be destroyed. Krampus is further weakened by the Hyperforce Ranger's holiday spirit as Santa uses the full force of his now damaged Sleigh Zord and then his own inner magical abilities to defeat Krampus in an explosive uppercut. After shrinking, Krampus retreats and the Hyperforce Rangers use their Hyperforce Zords to help Santa deliver the presents in time to save Christmas day. While celebrating the victory back at the North Pole the Rangers are contacted by Alpha 55 as the time ship appears in the sky. As the time ship lands and opens up the Hyperforce Rangers are greeted by Jack.\n----\nNote: Paul Schrier was absent from participating in this episode due to recovering from oral surgery.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |Title = Dr. Tommy Oliver Returns!\n |Aux1 = [[Jason David Frank]] as [[Tommy Oliver|Dr. Tommy Oliver]], the [[Power Rangers Dino Thunder|Dino Thunder]] Black Dino Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|02}}\n | ShortSummary= Jack exits the time ship along with Dr. Tommy Oliver to greet the other Hyperforce Rangers. Confused by Dr. Oliver's presence, the Hyperforce Rangers fill Jack in with their recent adventure with Santa and Jack in turn explains to the other Hyperforce Rangers that from his perspective the Hyperforce Rangers had been missing for several weeks and not just hours. In those weeks that the Hyperforce Rangers were missing Jack explains that he and Alpha 55 did an extensive search for them and were able to reprogram the time ship to detect time anomalies in the process. As a result, they were able to detect \"The Leader\" in Reefside in the year 2005 attempting to find Dr. Anton Mercer and revive his alter ego Mesogog. Jack explains that while in 2005 he met Dr. Oliver who in turn offered his expertise in finding the Hyperforce Rangers, eventually bringing the time ship to the North Pole in 1985. The Hyperforce Rangers and Dr. Oliver return to Reefside in the year 2005 to discover that Dr. Mercer is missing and Dr. Oliver's friend Haley is in the process of destroying his newly rebuilt underground headquarters, having prior been destroyed by Zeltrax. Eddie uses his focus ability to neutralize Hayley and they see a news broadcast where \"The Leader\" is demanding for Dr. Mercer and his alter ego Mesogog for his plans. The Hyperforce Rangers learn that Hayley's actions were the result of being exposed to a strange gas being emitted from Hayley's Cyber Cafe. The Hyperforce Rangers use their power to temporarily charge the Black Dino Gem so that Dr. Oliver can become the Black Dino Ranger once more and then they head to the Cyber Cafe. At the Cyber Cafe the Rangers discover the Putties and a horse plant hybrid Perfume Pony monster. The Hyperforce Rangers manage to drive off the people infected by the gas and discover that the Perfume Pony is the source of the gas. Eddie and Vesper are infected by the gas, but are brought back to their senses after taking blows to their heads. As the putties are defeated by Dr. Oliver and the other Hyperforce Rangers, Jack uses one of Dr. Oliver's borrowed gas masks to smother the Perfume Pony in its own gas causing the monster to grow. Alpha 55 works on an antidote to the gas and part of the Hyperforce team begins to cryonic-ally freeze the infected civilians attacking them. Dr. Oliver summons the Mezodon Megazord and the other Hyperforce Rangers follow him to suppress the Perfume Pony. Calling upon the Hyperforce Zords, the Perfume Pony is badly damaged. Dr. Oliver finishes the monster off with his Brachio Staff, sealing the monster underground. Using their combined powers the antidote is then dispersed around Reefside saving the civilians. Dr. Oliver receives a phone call from Dr. Mercer, who is at Mercer Industries. They head to Mercer Industries and discover a badly injured Mercer surrounded by Putties. The Putties are driven off and Mercer is healed by Dr. Oliver using the Hyperforce Rangers' healing charge technology. Mercer begins changing into Mesogog, brought back to life due to residual Dino DNA still in Mercer's system. The Hyperforce Rangers learn from Mercer and the partially revived Mesogog that they refused to help \"The Leader\" in his plan of conquest, a plan that is revealed to be somehow tied to Zordon. Alpha 55 detects a disturbance on the other side of Reefside and the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to use the gas antidote to help Mercer rid himself of Mesogog, but with little success. Dr. Oliver decides to stay behind to help Mercer in preventing Mesogog from fully reviving as the Hyperforce Rangers say their goodbyes and head off to check out the disturbance.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |Title = Family\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|09}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at the disturbance on the other side of Reefside and discover the stolen time ship. Scorpina confronts the Hyperforce Rangers as the stolen time ship slips away into a time stream. After a brief battle, Scorpina is knocked unconscious and the Hyperforce Rangers decide to take her prisoner aboard their time ship as they jump into a time stream to follow after the stolen time ship. Failing to learn any new information from Scorpina, Eddie forms his own hypothesis based on Mercer and Mesogog's information that \"The Leader\" may be trying to prevent Zordon's death and the subsequent energy wave that resulted from it from destroying most of the United Alliance of Evil back in 1998. Using an unknown electrical power, Scorpina breaks free of her imprisonment and severely cripples the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship's systems. The Hyperforce Rangers split up to search the ship for Scorpina with part of the team heading to engineering and the other part heading to the living quarters. The Rangers are then visited by various demonic visions based on their past lives and dreams for the future. Jack sees his deceased robot dog. Marv is visited by his missing brother Joe and Eddie sees his childhood sweetheart and now ex-fiancee Bianca. Vesper sees a vision of a cool Eddie and Chloe must come to terms with the appearance of her deceased mother. The Hyperforce Rangers come to the conclusion that the visions are tied in some way to Scorpina using information from the police notes that Jack made with Alpha 55 when he was searching for the other Rangers. Uncertain what is real and what is fake they decide to disclose information about their pasts with each other to prove that they are indeed the real Rangers and not just illusions. Marv discloses how he faked being a Time Force officer in order to find his missing brother and was subsequently turned in by Jack. Chloe speaks of her deceased parents and explains that she steals things for those who are less fortunate. It is revealed that the Alpha 55 in the medical bay is fake and the real Alpha 55 uses a chest cannon to blow the fake Alpha 55 through the side of the time ship leaving a gaping hole. The fake Alpha 55, Scorpina, and demonic visions are all revealed to actually be the shape-shifting monster Primator. After a brief battle, the Primator grows and the Rangers call upon the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord's Phoenix formation. Primator proves too strong and rips off the Megazord's arms. The Rangers leave their cockpits and attempt to use their cannons to defeat the monster, but Primator avoids the damage and further trashes the Hyperforce Zords before shrinking back to normal size. Using the subterfuge of rocks, trees, Bianca and chipmunks to manipulate the Rangers, Primator separates and overcomes Marv. Using Mesogog's invisi-portal technology stolen from Mercer Industries, Primator kidnaps Marv and escapes to rejoin \"The Leader\" aboard the stolen time ship. Uncertain of where they are, the remaining Hyperforce Rangers are left stranded with their time ship in need of desperate repair. The Hyperforce Rangers are then confronted by knights on horseback who accuse them of witchcraft after seeing Alpha 55 cloak himself and the damaged time ship out of fear. Alpha 55 contacts the Hyperforce Rangers to let them know that the ship's sensors indicate that they are stranded in the 6th century.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |Title = A Ranger in King Arthur's Court\n |Aux1 = [[Allie Gonino]] as [[Guinevere|Lady Guinevere]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|16}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers are led by the knights to their castle of [[Camelot]] where they meet Lady Guinevere and [[Merlin]]. The knights identify themselves as the knights of the [[Round Table]]: Sir [[Lancelot]], Sir [[Galahad]], and Eddie's ancestor Sir Edward Banks II. The Hyperforce Rangers explain to Guinevere how the \"magic\" of their time ship had caused them to end up their kingdom, how their team leader Marv was kidnapped, and how they are now stranded due to the damage that the time ship had endured. Guinevere and Merlin agree to have their finest blacksmiths help the Hyperforce Rangers in repairing their time ship in exchange for the Rangers' own help in finding Camelot's missing leader, [[King Arthur]], and destroying the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] that is believed to be responsible for both his disappearance and the mass devastation throughout the kingdom. The Hyperforce Rangers agree to help and then excuse themselves to freshen up for dinner before discussing a plan with Guinevere and Merlin in accomplishing their goals. Vesper decides at this time to pretend to be a man while Chloe decides to introduce Guinevere to invention of world's first burrito. The castle comes under attack from the red dragon, but Guinevere manages to chase it away with an arrow attack to the dragon's eye. Eddie, uncertain of his fate in the future after having met his ancestor, decides to give Sir Edward love advice to help ensure that someday he'll still be born. As the Rangers retire for the night, Jack learns more from Lancelot about Arthur's disappearance, the magic crystals that Guinevere and the knights received from Merlin, and the deaths of the knights [[Percival]] and [[Tristan]]. The next day the Hyperforce Rangers, Guinevere and the knights set off for the cave of the dragon. Eddie becomes concerned that Sir Edward is also coming along, knowing that if Sir Edward were to die it would also mean an end to his existence. While trying to find their bearings in the dark woods they confront a [[werewolf]] that attacks Guinevere's pet dragon. The Hyperforce Rangers injure the werewolf; reverting the creature back into a villager that they then send off back to the castle on horseback for medical attention. After leaving the woods they are attacked near an ocean-side cliff first by [[harpy|harpies]] and then by [[siren (mythology)|sirens]]. Guinevere and the knights use their gems to morph into more powerful Ranger-like knight forms. Chloe also morphs and drives off the harpies with her whirlwind attack, but Sir Edward falls from the cliff. Eddie, Guinevere, and Chloe each try to save Sir Edward, but the allure of the sirens' song proves too powerful to overcome in a direct confrontation. Guinevere and the Hyperforce Rangers instead use a song of their own to drive off the sirens. Finally arriving at the abandoned village and cave of the red dragon the Hyperforce, Guinevere, and knights confront the red dragon in battle. After several attacks and massive damage, Eddie and Sir Edward use the combined power of their water attacks within the dragon's mouth and cause the dragon to implode on itself in a massive fireball. Jack then launches the fireball down a well extinguishing it. It is revealed that the red dragon was in fact King Arthur all along, having been cursed by [[Morgan le Fay]]. The Hyperforce Rangers use their healing charge technology to heal Arthur. As thanks for their help Guinevere and Arthur reward the Hyperforce Rangers with a pink magic crystal similar to the ones that the knights used. Saying their goodbyes to Guinevere, Arthur, Sir Edward and the rest of the knights; Alpha 55 has the Hyperforce Rangers teleport back to the now repaired time ship. The Hyperforce Rangers then send a message back to the Time Force Academy in the year 3017 to apprise them of the situation in hopes that Professor Scotts may have a means of finding and saving Marv.\n----\nNote: Peter Sudarso was absent from participating in this episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 12\n |Title = Save Marv\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|23}}\n | ShortSummary= Its been three days since the Hyperforce Rangers sent their message to Time Force and Jen Scotts in the year 3017. Getting desperate for a sign of Marv's location Vesper attempts a seance with the rest of the Hyperforce Rangers and Alpha 55. Unexpectedly it works to a degree and they make a brief connection to Marv and Alpha 55 gets a lock on the stolen time ship travelling within the normal time stream. The Hyperforce Rangers then receive a reply back from Jen Scotts who informs them that she can not assist them at this time due to dealing with \"The Alliance\" still present in the year 3017, but that she was going to send back an agent to help assist them. Not knowing who this agent was or when they would arrive the Hyperforce Rangers decide to drop from the hyper stream to the normal time stream to pursue the stolen time ship and begin to experience a similar turbulence to the last time they attempted to follow the stolen time ship so closely. Meanwhile aboard the stolen time ship \"The Leader\" continues his relentless torture and interrogation of Marv trying to ascertain how the Hyperforce Rangers are tracking his stolen ship so easily, yet he is not able to track the Hyperforce's ship. Marv attempts to buy time and feed misinformation to \"The Leader\" stating that they planted a tracker aboard the stolen ship. Finding Marv useless, \"The Leader\" decides that Alpha 55 must be the key and sends the Primator monster through an invisi-portal back to the Hyperforce's ship to kidnap Alpha. Primator disguises itself as Marv, but the Hyperforce Rangers aren't buying it. Eddie, remembering from what he read in the archives of when the Mighty Morphin Rangers faced Primator, decides to use a mirrored piece of the ship to reveal the Primator's identity. Unfazed, the Primator uses the image of Jack's robot dog and Chloe's deceased mom to escape and further mess with the Hyperforce Rangers while searching the ship for Alpha 55. Back aboard the stolen time ship, Marv is freed from his cell by a mysterious Time Force Silver Ranger with the ability to cloak himself invisible. The Silver Ranger reveals himself to be Joe, Marv's brother. Marv, under duress from several days of sleep deprivation and mental torture by \"The Leader\" and Primator, refuses to believe Joe; thinking that he is the Primator further trying to mess with his head. After some convincing, Marv eventually leaves the cell with alarms sounding, causing Putties to head toward the cell room. Joe claims that in order to get off the ship they need to destroy the main command room and Marv taps into one of the stolen ship's computers to bring up map schematics of the ship. Marv destroys a large group of Putties but is then confronted by Velchanos and a group of newly created Putties. Joe distracts Velchanos and the Putties as Marv sneaks away into the main command room being operated by Scorpina. Back on the Hyperforce's ship, Vesper tries to ram the stolen time ship in order to get it to drop its shields to teleport Marv, but with no success. Eddie attempts to follow Jack's advice of locking Primator in the pocket dimension, but finds himself locked inside instead. Vesper and Chloe then attempt to lure the Primator to the airlock to eject him out into the time stream. Not falling for the trick, Primator grabs Alpha and tries to make an escape through an invisi-portal. Chloe shoots the Primator in the back while disguised as her mother; then Jack throws himself in the way, freeing Alpha. Vesper in turn frees Jack with an attack and opens the airlock. Chloe uses the power of the pink gem she received from Guinevere to summon a Knight-like Battlizer form and blasts Primator out of the airlock, seemingly destroying the monster. Back aboard the stolen time ship, Marv sneaks into the engineering section and begins to smash the electronics, disabling the shields. Alpha detects two Ranger signatures and locks on to Marv, teleporting him away just before Scorpina and \"The Leader\" can destroy him. Marv informs the other Hyperforce Rangers that while he can't say for certainty, he  was saved by a Time Force Silver Ranger that may be his lost brother Joe. Joe then teleports to the Hyperforce's time ship. The Hyperforce Rangers try to get answers but are further confused when Joe refuses to fill them in as to why he was missing or what he is currently doing. Joe says his goodbyes and then teleports away. The Hyperforce Rangers then briefly discuss what Marv saw aboard the stolen ship, why \"The Leader\" thinks Alpha 55 may be important, why \"The Leader\" is unable to track the Hyperforce time ship, how the Hyperforce Rangers were able to connect to Marv briefly through their bond to the Morphin Grid and the possibility of tracking Joe through that same connection. The Hyperforce Rangers then decide to jump back into the hyper stream in order to repair their damaged ship and regroup before the stolen time ship has a chance to retaliate.\n----\nNotes: 1.

Jack and Eddie then confide in each other more about their past, from Jack's parents losing their lives in a war when Jack was young to Eddie having difficulties with stepping out of the shadow of his family's legacy. Meanwhile, Chloe, suffering from junk food withdrawal, searches the ship for Vesper desperately in the hope that the kitchen can be repaired. Alpha 55 hears Chloe crying for Vesper and tries to calm her down while trying to cover for Vesper's disappearance by telling Chloe that Vesper is napping. Chloe then goes off to find Marv, who is currently in the simulator repeatedly reliving his nightmare on board the stolen time ship as a prisoner. Concerned for Marv, Chloe has a talk with him about his brother's secret mission. Marv tells Chloe he feels like he is unworthy to be the leader of the Hyperforce Rangers. Chloe, in turn, confesses that she feels similar with her role as a Ranger and that the only reason she joined Time Force was to find answers about her own parents' disappearance, even if it meant stealing the information from Time Force itself. Alpha 55 joins them in the simulator and surprises Chloe with a repaired food replicator, but needs Chloe's help in entering the recipes. Chloe takes this time to also have Alpha 55 contact Time Force with her concern for Marv and his brother's secret mission. A short time later, the Hyperforce Rangers discuss \"The Alliance\" intentions some more but with little progress when Alpha 55 picks up a time anomaly in the town of [[Power Rangers Mystic Force|Briarwood]] in the year 2005. Not wanting to be a step behind yet again, Jack asks Alpha 55 if its possible to teleport there a day early to stop \"The Alliance\" to which Alpha 55 complies. While in Briarwood, the Hyperforce Rangers track an energy signature to a candy store before hearing the sirens of several fire trucks. The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at a burning apartment building and spring into action to save any lives inside. Alpha 55 then detects the time anomaly occurring ahead of schedule and teleports the Hyperforce Rangers to the site where they meet the Mystic Mother in her Mystic Palace. Mystic Mother confesses that she had sensed the Hyperforce Rangers and had actually been the one to summon them there. Mystic Mother learns from the Hyperforce Rangers about the plan to revive Zordon and tells them about her past as Rita Repulsa and that Zordon's revival must be stopped at all cost to maintain the future. Mystic Mother then helps Chloe, Marv, Eddie and Jack confront their insecurities to unlock their full potential with upgraded weapons for the entire team, before teleporting the Rangers back to their time ship. Back aboard the time ship, Chloe receives a reply back from Time Force with declassified files on Marv's brother and his secret mission. The Hyperforce Rangers decide to follow up on the secret mission lead and set the time ship for the year 2025.\n----\nNotes: 1.

Vesper wakes from her nap and attempts another seance to make a connection to Joe, but Alpha 55 has a better plan and takes a DNA sample from Marv and uses that sample in conjunction with the ship's sensors to track people with a similar DNA signature. Alpha 55 manages to make a connection with Joe, but the signature is weak enough that there is a half hour lag. The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at the apartment of Adonis Washington and are confronted by Detective Lina Song of S.P.D.'s D-Squad when a proton accelerator is mysteriously stolen. The Hyperforce Rangers attempt to remain incognito by passing themselves off as \"H-Squad\" from planet Kaien's S.P.D. division. Detective Song and the Hyperforce Rangers track the proton accelerator's signature to the Oak's Furniture Company where they are confronted by a furniture pirate themed mutant known as Captain Pegs and his monstrous pet macaw known as Birdie. After a brief skirmish with both monsters, Chloe uses the Gem to enter her Pink Battle Warrior form and exposes the monsters' mutant DNA with a blast, making them grow. The Hyperforce Rangers combine their recently upgraded weapons from Mystic Mother to form the Hyper Vortex Cannon and destroy Birdie. Captain Pegs retaliates, but Eddie makes quick work of the monster by making its wooden body swell with water till exploding. Detective Song then takes the Hyperforce Rangers to meet with Commander Anubis \"Doggie\" Cruger for debriefing. Cruger is suspicious of the Hyperforce Rangers' cover story of being \"H-Squad\", but he does believe them enough to let them tag along and look for their undercover officer as S.P.D. tracks down the stolen proton accelerator while the A-Squad Rangers are off-world and B-Squad is still in training to become Rangers. With Detective Song's surveillance equipment the Hyperforce Rangers go undercover to follow a lead on Captain Peg's employer, a frog mutant known as Napoleon Wrench, that takes them to a seedy hideout for misfit teens. While there, Eddie is mistaken for his ancestor from 2025, Johnny Banks. Napoleon Wrench calls a meeting with all the misfit teens and reveals that their plans will soon come to fruition now that he is in possession of the proton accelerator thanks to Maxwell. Napoleon then names Maxwell as his personal guard as Maxwell is revealed from a distance to the Hyperforce Rangers to be Joe Shih in disguise.\n----\nNotes: 1.

Joe recognizes Vesper in the crowd and attempts to maintain his cover as \"Maxwell\" by dispatching one of the teens, the lobster armed mutant Jackson, to deal with her stating that she may be dangerous. Napoleon is alerted by Jackson to the detection of someone or something from the future. Joe tells Napoleon that he will deal with the problem, but not wanting to risk losing the proton accelerator for their beacon to initiate the \"Absorption\", Napoleon instead chooses to have himself and Joe retreat to another room in the building while alerting the mutant teens to deal with the threat. Jack tries to create a diversion and lure some of the mutant teens away by saying there is free ice cream, but only succeeds in distracting Chloe instead. Jack resigns himself to pretending to be a mutant using a boot. Under Marv's advisement, Chloe then decides to \"Power Streak\" by stripping off Detective Song's coat and damaging it in process, much to Song's dismay, before running away from the crowd of mutants. Vesper uses her hologram ability to look like a lizard mutant and distracts even more mutants into looking for a lost purse and dog. Joe convinces Napoleon to let him go back and deal with the problem and uses the opportunity to go invisible to tamper with the proton accelerator. Marv goes to help Vesper escape the mutants while Eddie comes to Chloe's aid and destroys an incoming barrel, hurting Chloe in the process. Eddie and Chloe then combine their powers to create a wall of water to wash many of the mutant teens away. With Joe taking too long to reply back, Napoleon checks on the proton accelerator and catches \"Maxwell\" in the process of tampering with it. Napoleon reprimands Joe physically, but Joe manages to barely talk himself out of the situation as the two retreat from the hideout with the proton accelerator to the barge. Detective Song takes the Hyperforce Rangers back to S.P.D.'s headquarters for severely botching the mission to retrieve the proton accelerator. Cruger and Song separate the Hyperforce Rangers into different cells and begin to interrogate them more severely after Cruger learns from S.P.D.'s main command that there is no \"H-Squad\" or S.P.D. division on the planet Kaien. While being interrogated, each Hyperforce Ranger takes a different tactic to dealing with Cruger and Song. Chloe refuses commands to power down and acts overall aloof. Vesper cracks dog jokes, howls from her cell, and morphs; forgetting that S.P.D. was already aware that she could. Eddie is unable to take the pressure, freaking out completely. He cracks, spilling his guts within only a literal matter of seconds, but Cruger and Song are unable to fully comprehend due to the speed at which he had said it. Cruger tries to confirm Eddie's story with Jack, who will only recite his rank and serial number. Cruger then tries again with Marv who becomes the most confrontational of the five. Back at the barge, Joe continues to tamper with the proton accelerator while hooking it up to the beacon. Joe attempts to warn one of the more trustful teens, the turtle legged mutant Carl, to leave before it is too late. Napoleon overhears Joe and notices that he is tampering with the proton accelerator yet again. Enraged, Napoleon decides that \"Maxwell\" can't be trusted and attempts to have him eliminated. Joe blows his cover and reveals that he is with Time Force. Unable to defeat Napoleon in a head on head confrontation, Joe attempts to destroy the proton accelerator. The proton is accelerator is activated instead, badly injuring Joe and vaporizing Napoleon. The pulse makes S.P.D. aware that the beacon has been activated and the Hyperforce Rangers are released to deal with the problem; with Song giving the Hyperforce Rangers a \"one use\" healing charge replica. The stolen time ship lands and \"The Leader\" appears. The proton accelerator is removed from the beacon and given to Velchanos to repair the stolen time ship. Scorpina relays to \"The Leader\" that the ship is being repaired, but the reboot sequence has initiated a security protocol requiring a Time Force signature. \"The Leader\" begins to absorb the life force energy of the mutant teens, but Joe interferes. The saved mutant teens try to flee as the Hyperforce Rangers arrive within their Hyper Zords. Eddie, with Chloe's help, uses S.P.D.'s \"one use\" healing charge replica to heal Joe making \"The Leader\" aware to their presence. Jack then damages \"The Leader\" with a barrage of missiles. \"The Leader\" tosses Joe while taking his morpher and, despite Vesper's efforts to protect the mutant teens, finishes to absorb their life force energy. \"The Leader\" then returns to the stolen time ship, activating it with the stolen morpher, and re-enters the time stream. The Hyperforce Rangers activate their own healing charge technology to revive Carl, but don't have enough energy to revive the other mutant teens. Detective Song contacts the Hyperforce Rangers to say that S.P.D. will take care of the unconscious mutant teens. The Hyperforce Rangers then board their time ship as Alpha 55 sets the tracking signal to Joe's stolen morpher and enters the time stream to chase after the stolen time ship.\n----\nNote: Zac Eubank has a brief [[non-player character|NPC]] cameo appearance in this episode, reprising his role as Anubis \"Doggie\" Cruger, the leader of S.P.D.'s earth division and eventual [[Power Rangers S.P.D.|S.P.D.]] Shadow Ranger.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 16\n |Title = Homecoming\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|02|20}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers, with Joe recovering in the medical bay, follow the stolen time ship two years further into the future to the year 2027 where they arrive at an off-world S.P.D. correctional facility on the planet Y37. \"The Leader\" breaks into the facility and frees the S.P.D. A-Squad from their imprisonment for police corruption and treason against S.P.D. by aligning with the Troobian Empire. Jack suggests that it may be in the team's best interest to capture the A-Squad's Red Ranger, Charlie and interrogate her for information. Vesper however has another plan and builds a pair of bombs with the hope of destroying the facility against the other Hyperforce Ranger's better judgement. As A-Squad infiltrates the watchtower and harasses the guard, the Hyperforce Rangers discuss the best way to infiltrate the facility. Ignoring the conversation, Vesper throws caution to the wind and lets out the battle cry of \"[[Leeroy Jenkins]]\" as she jumps into action. The remaining Hyperforce Rangers immediately jump into action to aid Vesper, but Chloe misjudges her jump and ends up in the moat instead. Vesper threatens to blow up A-Squad with her bombs, forcing them to retreat. Eddie checks on the guard as Chloe uses her whirlwind attack with the water from the moat to slow down A-Squad from escaping. As the other Hyperforce Rangers catch up to Chloe, Vesper uses one of her bombs to injure A-Squad. The A-Squad Rangers attempt to retaliate, but are blinded by the smoke. Using the smoke cloud from the exploded bomb to their advantage, Eddie grabs hold of A-Squad Red and A-Squad Blue is knocked unconscious. With Marv's help Jack uses his plasma restraints and taser restraints on the pair. Vesper tries to apprehend A-Squad Green, but takes an elbow to face; angering Eddie. As A-Squad Green is defeated Eddie and Vesper quip about the \"[[Easter egg (media)|inferiority]]\" of [[inside joke|thinking]] that a Green Ranger could ever [[Power Rangers Megaforce|replace]] a Black Ranger. Chloe uses another whirlwind attack to dispatch of A-Squad Pink and A-Squad Yellow as an unknown S.P.D. Green Ranger shows up responding to the facility's distress signal. Against Marv's wishes Chloe, followed by Vesper, dog pile on top of him and A-Squad Red as the unnamed S.P.D. Green Ranger contains the five A-Squad Rangers in cards. The S.P.D. Green Ranger reveals herself to be Song, having been promoted in the two years since she had last seen Hyperforce. She explains that the mutant teens had been brought back to health and that S.P.D. had been helping them find a normal means of living off the street. Vesper starts to shut down, feeling overwhelmed emotionally and homesick; so the other Hyperforce Rangers help her back to the time ship. Enraged at Hyperforce interfering yet again; \"The Leader\" has the stolen time ship searched and discovers a tracker Joe had planted on board. With the tracker destroyed and the stolen morpher's signal also gone; the stolen time ship slips back into the time stream. With no clue as what to do next, the Hyperforce Rangers head back to the Time Force Academy in the year 3017. Vesper decides to thank Chloe for helping her earlier during her emotional breakdown by gifting the remaining bomb to her. As Joe debriefs, the Hyperforce Rangers meet up with former classmate Abigail. Vesper and Chloe immediately fill Abigail in on the fun that they've had experimenting with \"illegal\" substances of the 31st century; such as [[sugar]], [[caffeine]] and [[trans fats]]. Abigail then informs them as to what has been happening with \"The Alliance\" in the year 3017 and they become alerted to the fact that additional time ships had been stolen since the initial ship \"The Leader\" stole. The four cadets officially graduate in an informal ceremony, becoming full-fledged Time Force officers. Jack is also promoted a rank. The Hyperforce Rangers then decide to split up to each handle some personal matters before returning to their mission. Vesper and Jack confront Vesper's parents to learn that she was a synthetic organism pioneered by the late man who was both the creator of the Cyclobot technology and their employer; Dr. Louis Fericks. They explain that they had rescued a young Vesper from burning to death the night that the lab was destroyed and how she was named for the star in the night's sky on that fateful day. Meanwhile, Eddie confronts Bianca and they mutually decide to break their arranged engagement, to be nothing more than business partners and casual friends. After showing off her Ranger outfit around the Time Force Academy, Chloe confesses to Abigail why she joined Time Force and asks Abigail to search for more information on her parents. Marv and Joe have a heart to heart about his secret mission, the suffering its caused and how Joe was unaware that his and Hyperforce's missions were connected. The brothers then confront their parents with the news that Joe is alive. A short time later the Hyperforce Rangers meet up and Vesper has gifts in hand from home. Much to Jack's displeasure, he learns that Vesper also secretly took the family dog despite warning her about his phobia to small animals. The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at the burned out remains of the lab where they meet other synthetic organisms created by Dr. Fericks. They reveal to Vesper that they had witnessed the destruction of the lab 17 years earlier at the hands of a mutant known as Ransik and that they had helped Dr. Fericks rebuild himself into the cyborg Frax. Vesper vows that she will help her \"sibling\" synthetic organisms get revenge on Ransik for what he had done to their \"father\" Dr. Fericks.\n----\nNote: Yoshi Sudarso was unable to participate during the first half of the episode due to running late, but joins in towards the end of the second half.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 17\n |Title = Director Ransik\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|02|27}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers inform Vesper that as a Time Force officer it may not be in her best interest to help her synthetic \"siblings\" Spencer, Rory, Jocelyn and Josh in their attempt to get revenge on Ransik now that he has reformed from his criminal ways. The Hyperforce Rangers promise to investigate the matter further, but the synthetics become impatient and further pressure Vesper to help them in their plan for revenge. Vesper refuses and the synthetics attempt to take their leave. Joe teleports in front of the synthetics and tries to stop them making the synthetics become confrontational. As the synthetics make their escape, Eddie and Vesper pull the child like synthetic Josh aside and discover that he is unable to speak due to a malfunctioning voice box. Vesper uses the healing charge technology to repair Josh's ability to speak. The Hyperforce Rangers attempt to gain Josh's trust with one of Chloe's \"aged\" burritos. Marv's attempt to heat the burrito goes awry turning the peace offering to ash, but Joe manages salvage the situation by revealing he still has some food he packed from the visit home. The Hyperforce Rangers decide to make their way to City Hall in order to find out Ransik's latest whereabouts. Joe begins to get cold feet and decides that he has to take care of something before he confronts Ransik. The Hyperforce Rangers pressure Joe into telling them what the problem is. Joe reveals that he was \"sort of\" engaged to Ransik's daughter Nadira before he \"disappeared\" on his secret mission without informing her. The Hyperforce Rangers excuse Joe to take care of the situation as they arrive at City Hall. Vesper comes to the realization that she left her dog Yappy behind at the burned down lab. Chloe responds by pulling the dog from her tote and announces that she has arbitrarily renamed the dog Burrito. Finding the Mutant Rehabilitation Center's doors locked, the Hyperforce Rangers learn from Jack's former boss Chief Petell that Ransik has taken some rehabilitated mutants to the animal shelter to take care of the animals as part of their rehabilitation therapy. Chief Petell then informs Jack that he needs to clean out his old office now that he is a Hyperforce Ranger, much to Jack's disdain. At the animal shelter, the Hyperforce Rangers confront Ransik about the synthetics and learn from Ransik about how he was indeed responsible for both the lab's destruction as well as the final fate of Dr. Fericks after having become the cyborg Frax. At Nadira's house, Joe learns that Nadira has gone to the animal shelter to help her father. Back at the shelter, Josh attempts to destroy Ransik, but the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to distract him. Chloe suggests that throwing Josh in a cage might work, but Vesper considers that \"babysitting\" may require them having to sit on \"baby\" Josh instead. Joe arrives at the shelter to talk to Nadira as Josh informs the Hyperforce Rangers that he has telepathically contacted his synthetic \"siblings\" to alert them of Ransik's presence. As the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to protect Ransik from the synthetics, Vesper manages to tap into Jocelyn's mind and gives Jack enough time to put Jocelyn into stasis. Eddie restrains Josh as Vesper taps into his mind. While inside Josh's mind, Josh informs Vesper that he cannot help but want revenge due to his current programming. Vesper promises Josh that she will help to reprogram him. Chloe manages to put restraints on Spencer, but Spencer breaks away from Chloe and uses the restraints to ricochet Marv's taser blasts back into him. Jack blocks Rory from attacking Ransik as Joe complies to Nadira's pleas to save her father and teleports in to flip Rory to the ground. Vesper manages to transfer her memories of love, family and friendship into Josh; quelling the flames of \"vengeance\" that were burning in his mind. With Josh saved, Josh disengages from Vesper and in turn engages Spencer's mind. Eddie then rushes Vesper to Rory who engages his mind with a kiss. Vesper then complicates things further by sending mixed signals to Eddie in telling him how they can never be more than friends all the while kissing him. Heartbroken, Eddie seeks comfort from Jack and Joe. With three of the synthetics freed of their need for revenge, Jack releases Jocelyn from her stasis so that the same can be done for her. Overwhelmed by all that has happened, Vesper tells the synthetics that she can never be a part of their family as she never grew up with them. Vesper decides she needs some alone time and goes off to think about the recent events. Joe decides to stay behind for a bit to finish his conversation with Nadira and Ransik. Marv and Eddie return to Time Force Academy to prepare the time ship for departure while Chloe and Jack go back to City Hall to clean out Jack's old office. As Jack reminisces about his beat cop days with Chloe, Chief Petell and Jack's old cop buddies show up to give Jack a proper send-off for his new promotion. As they continue to talk Jack learns from Chief Petell that there is a janitor by the name of Steven Lang that is currently in custody who seems to have intimate knowledge of what \"The Alliance\" has in plan. Jack contacts the other Hyperforce Rangers about the potential lead as he and Chloe interrogate the janitor and learn that aside from saving Zordon \"The Alliance\" plans to amass an armada of alien ships from the year 2014.\n----\nNote: This episode did not have a ''Fireside Chat'' due to a [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] charity event that immediately followed the show.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |Title = Stage 4: The Armada\n |Aux1 = Cameron Jebo as Orion, the [[Power Rangers Megaforce|Super Megaforce]] Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|06}}\n | ShortSummary= Following up on the new lead from the janitor the Hyperforce Rangers learn more from Alpha 55 about the Warstar Armada that invaded earth in the year 2014. Alpha 55 informs the Hyperforce Rangers that one of the Rangers responsible for the Armada's defeat came from the planet Andresia who's population was decimated by the Armada. The Hyperforce Rangers decide that this alien Ranger may be able to inform them more about this Armada and travel to the planet Andresia sometime during the year 2013 or 2014; just shortly after the population of Andresia was destroyed by the Armada. Chloe chooses to remain in her Ranger form and throws on Song's ripped trench coat as a disguise. The Hyperforce Rangers become concerned and a tad disgusted as Vesper decides to address Chloe directly about her questionable hygiene for wearing her Ranger costume for weeks on end. Chloe agrees they may be right but nonchalantly chooses to remain morphed anyway. On the planet surface, they meet Orion who is fishing. Vesper confronts Orion and scares away his fish, annoying Orion to a degree. As Vesper reprograms their morphers with a tongue lick to understand Orion's language Eddie makes up for Vesper's transgression by catching two fish for Orion. As Chloe reveals herself to Orion, she is mistaken for a robot by Orion. Angered, Chloe has to be restrained by the other Hyperforce Rangers from attacking Orion. Vesper informs the other Hyperforce Rangers that she has a plan for taking care of the Armada, stating that the remnants of the Venjix [[computer virus|virus]] still remain within her. Orion fills Jack in on how he used to mine ore, how the Armada ships have been loading up on the various ores of the planet, and how he failed to capture an Armada ship after downing it. As Jack continues to learn more from Orion about his past, Vesper mistakes what Orion says as a pickup line and runs off telling Orion that she can't live with hurting another person emotionally. Eddie talks with Marv about how lonely he is seeing how the other Hyperforce Rangers interact with each other. Marv attempts to comfort Eddie, telling him that the Hyperforce Rangers are only so close because of his efforts. Feeling better, Eddie and Marv rejoin Jack and Orion as Orion informs them of how he found his morpher while mining at the quarry. Chloe finds Vesper moping and tries to get her to come back to the rest of the group. Vesper tells Chloe that she thinks that she is broken and has been since Venjix had infected her. Vesper tries to run a diagnostic on herself, but with little success. As the girls make their way back to the rest of the group an Armada ship flies by. The Hyperforce Rangers and Orion follow the Armada ship to the woods. As The Hyperforce Rangers and Orion take cover behind a rock, Eddie combines his water attack with Chloe's whirlwind attack to create a water spout hurricane attack and down an Armada ship. As the remaining Armada ships flee with the recovered X-Borg pilot, the Hyperforce Rangers commandeer the downed Armada ship and start making repairs. Using the remnants of the Venjix virus Vesper configures a new form of the [[Trojan horse (computing)|virus]] and installs it into the repaired Armada ship with a tongue lick, turning the ship into a literal [[Trojan horse]]. Marv informs Orion that it is imperative to preserve the timeline and that he should come up with a cover story to explain how he captured the Armada ship. Chloe suggests that he should say he shot it down with a bow, but Orion decides to go with a slingshot instead. Vesper has Alpha 55 teleport her dog Burrito down and attempts to give the dog to Orion, though Orion declines the offer. Orion says his goodbyes and takes off in the Armada ship as the Hyperforce Rangers return to their time ship. The Hyperforce Rangers travel back to earth slightly farther in the future of the year 2014 having detected a time anomaly during the day of the Legendary Battle. The Hyperforce Rangers are confronted by a message from \"The Leader\" informing them that they are too late to stop him. Chloe activates her Pink Battle Warrior form and enters Emperor Mavro's lead Armada ship as Troy and Orion crash Orion's Armada ship into the side of the lead ship. With Vesper's help, Chloe activates the reconfigured Venjix virus, causing the lead ship to blast many of the smaller Armada ships. Scorpina and Velchanos attempt to abduct the remaining Armada ships for \"The Alliance\" to use, but are forced to retreat after finding their efforts are in vain due to the spreading Venjix virus. As Chloe makes her escape from the lead Armada ship, she uses her whirlwind blast to knock Troy and Orion to safety from the exploding ship. Chloe is damaged from the explosion and is forced to power down to her normal Ranger mode. The Hyperforce Rangers return to their time ship and monitor the Super Megaforce Rangers destroying Emperor Mavro while keeping \"The Alliance\" at bay. With an army of X-Borgs and Bruisers approaching, the Hyperforce Rangers witness the arrival of every legendary Power Ranger and the start of the Legendary Battle. Eddie begs Alpha 55 to let them join in despite the chance of altering the future and Alpha 55 agrees that the legendary Rangers could use the help. During the battle the Hyperforce Rangers come to the aid of many of the legendary Rangers unnoticed, though Marv gets Dr. Oliver's attention when Marv has an epic fail and runs off to hide. Knowing that the Hyperforce Rangers shouldn't be there, Dr. Oliver tries to get the Hyperforce Rangers to leave before they alter the timeline too severely. With the battle won the Hyperforce Rangers offer to return Orion home to Andresia so that he can search for any survivors from the Armada attack. The Hyperforce Rangers then return to the time stream to continue their mission.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |Title = Shattered Grid Part 1\n |Aux1 = [[Kyle Higgins]] as [[impostor|\"Captain Michael Hicks\"]]<br/>Malika Lim as Colonel Lina Song\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|13}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers become concerned and have Alpha 55 double check to be certain that their plan to sabotage the Armada had been completely successful. Alpha 55 confirms that the modified Venjix virus was completely successful and had spread to the ships beyond earth. Even with their success against \"The Alliance\" plan to acquire the Armada ships, the Hyperforce Rangers continue to be unsettled now knowing that additional time ships were stolen from Time Force and not having any other leads to follow up on beyond preserving Zordon's death in 1998. Vesper decides to [[Breaking the fourth wall|post]] about preserving Zordon's death through social media sites. As Vesper and Chloe nearly coerce Marv into singing with them an alarm sounds out. Alpha 55 declares that a dark energy has emerged from the normal time stream and somehow entered the hyper stream. Believing that \"The Alliance\" may have obtained the ability to enter the hyper stream from one of the additional time ships they had stolen the Hyperforce Rangers decide to investigate. The Hyperforce Rangers find themselves back in Newtech City at an unknown point in time. As they survey the city from their time ship the Hyperforce Rangers find the city oddly familiar and yet different in a surreal dystopian sense. The Hyperforce Rangers decide to go down on foot to get a better look. Vesper overhears an announcement that the curfew was now in effect as Chloe spies a group of individuals that resemble multiple Mighty Morphin Black Rangers. Eddie decides to investigate the mysterious group of Black Rangers further when he is hit with a spotlight and told to drop to his knees. Vesper tries to come to Eddie's aid, but is also stopped. Not tolerant of Vesper's antics, one of the Black Rangers hits Vesper upside the head with the butt of his gun. Marv gains the attention of the Black Rangers as he morphs in a massive explosion and takes out the Black Ranger that had hit Vesper. Chloe and Jack join in on the fight as Eddie kicks the unconscious Black Ranger for hurting Vesper. Eddie then disarms another Black Ranger and tosses the gun at the Black Ranger manning the spot light from the guard tower to take him out. Dazed and possibly suffering from a concussion, Vesper morphs with the awkward phrase of \"Its Torphin Mime\" and chops down another one of the guard towers with her weapon. As the battle continues on the Hyperforce Rangers are saved by a group of soldiers led by Captain Michael Hicks. On their way to the soldiers base of operations Marv tries to talk to Vesper about being reckless, but Vesper informs Marv that she would rather be injured herself than to have someone she loves get injured as she is more replaceable. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to follow the soldiers back to their base Captain Hicks recognizes that these Rangers are not of this reality. Captain Hicks informs the Hyperforce Rangers that this is not the first time the resistance, known as \"The Coinless\", has met Rangers from an alternate timeline and fills them in on what had happened to their world. Captain Hicks asks the Hyperforce Rangers what they knew of Tommy Oliver's past, to which they draw a blank despite Eddie's best effort to remember past Dino Thunder. Captain Hicks informs the Hyperforce Rangers that in most realities Tommy had at one point been the Mighty Morphin Green Ranger under a spell working for Rita Repulsa. Unlike other realities though, when the spell was broken in this reality Tommy chose to remain on the side of evil, helping Rita Repulsa to kill Zordon and most of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers slowly. In a last-ditch effort, the Ninjor of this reality helped to create the White Tiger coin for Jason, but Jason was killed and the coin was claimed by Tommy. With both the Dragon coin and White Tiger coin in hand, Tommy fused the two together to create a new hybrid coin and was renamed Lord Drakkon after one of the warriors who had served Rita Repulsa 10,000 years ago. Using the stolen Mastodon, Sabre-tooth Tiger, Pterodactyl and Tyrannosaurus coins Lord Drakkon created death squadrons known as the Ranger Sentries to enforce Rita Respulsa's rule upon the earth. Eventually Lord Zedd would also join in on the conquest of earth and captured Newtech City. Lord Drakkon then turned on Rita and Zedd, eventually toppling both and taking complete control of the planet for himself. Captain Hicks further explains that \"The Coinless\" would eventually be aided by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers of an [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|alternate timeline]] and that the alternate Billy would use the only coin of this reality not stolen, the Triceratops coin, to create an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] disabling Lord Drakkon and his Ranger Sentries from morphing before those alternate Mighty Morphin Rangers disappeared back to their reality and seemingly taking Lord Drakkon back with them. With a power vacuum left in Lord Drakkon's absence, the evil forces that were under him have begun to splinter off to take control of the world. The dominant faction is lead by the alternate Mighty Morphin reality's Scorpina, who seeks the power for herself. Another faction remains loyal to Lord Drakkon and is led by his cyborg assistant Finster 5. The Hyperforce Rangers are disturbed that such a reality could possibly exist. As the Hyperforce Rangers meet the leader of the soldiers they learn that the Colonel is this alternate reality's version of Lina Song. Seeing the deplorable state that the people live in, Chloe tries to get Alpha 55 to beam down the half rotten junk food from under her bed. Alpha 55 chastises Chloe for the mess, so Vesper promises to Chloe that she'll reprogram Alpha 55 later so that he doesn't remember. Colonel Song observes that Vesper and Chloe are rather odd and asks if perhaps they may be \"[[special needs|special]]\" to which Chloe responds to with an enthusiastic yes as she goes into Pink Battle Warrior form. Chloe then makes burritos for the soldiers and other Hyperforce Rangers using meat from the assorted animals she could find in the sewers. The Hyperforce Rangers and soldiers come up with a plan to rescue some of \"The Coinless\" from one of Scorpina's prisons,  but Colonel Song warns that they must be cautious as the Ranger Sentries may unleash \"The Great Destroyer\" upon them. The soldiers Major Galushi, Scout Fidget and Private Rice decide to sneak into the prison using an underground tunnel while most of the Hyperforce Rangers cause a distraction at the prison's main gate by using the explosions of Jack's morph and the spare bomb Vesper had gifted to Chloe after having dealt with the S.P.D. A-Squad. Marv summons his Lion Hyper Zord to deal with the Mastodon and Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries as Colonel Song and Vesper make their way to the server room and download documents pertaining to \"The Great Destroyer\", the nickname given to this reality's Serpentera; Lord Zedd's War Zord. The rescued members of \"The Coinless\" inform the other soldiers and the Hyperforce Rangers that the person they've been calling \"Captain Hicks\" is an impostor as they witnessed the fate of the real Captain Hicks. \"Captain Hicks\" reveals himself to be Finster 5's monster Pumpkin Rapper and starts a rap battle with Eddie. The Hyperforce Rangers do massive damage to Pumpkin Rapper, forcing him to grow in an unstable manner and risking explosion. Jack and Eddie try to save as many of the prisoners as they can while Chloe and Marv blasts Pumpkin Rapper. Rather than continuing the fight, Pumpkin Rapper decides to inflict as much damage as possible by going into self destruct mode and suicide bombs the prison and Hyper Zords. The Hyper Zords remain mostly unscathed from the blast, however Jack and Vesper are both badly injured in the blast with Jack being forced out of morph. The Hyperforce Rangers become disillusioned and emotionally shell-shocked when they realize the full extent of the blast. Many of the Ranger Sentries had been vaporized and nearly all the prisoners they had tried to save were killed. As Marv, Chloe, and Eddie check on Vesper and Jack they are surrounded by incoming trucks filled with Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries. A squad of Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentries then drops in from an airship along with a menacing figure that the Hyperforce Rangers immediately recognize from the propaganda posters. Lord Drakkon has returned.\n----\nNotes: 1. This is the first episode to feature more than one guest player.\n\n2.

The figure makes his way to the nearest coffee shop as people run for cover. The figure is revealed to be Lord Drakkon. Lord Drakkon makes a call on his communicator and requests for an immediate transport pickup back to Angel Grove. The Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry on other end informs Lord Drakkon that the Scorpina of the alternate Mighty Morphin reality has staged a coup d'\u00e9tat in his absence and has made a play to capture Serpentera. Lord Drakkon changes his plan and informs the Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry to have the transport take him to Newtech City instead. Flash forward back to the present, the Hyperforce Rangers are surrounded by Lord Drakkon and the Ranger Sentries. Alpha 55 informs the Hyperforce Rangers that they are in the presence of the dark energy they had detected earlier in the hyper stream. Emotionally distraught by the charred bodies of dead prisoners strewn about, Chloe lets her temper get the better of her and lashes out, attempting to take out Lord Drakkon as Marv tries to hold her back. Lord Drakkon demands that the Hyperforce Rangers submit to his will and help him obtain Serpentera before Scorpina has a chance to activate it. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to disobey Lord Drakkon decides to show that he is not in the mood to play games. The surviving prisoners and soldiers of \"The Coinless\" are round up as a demonstration. Lord Drakkon decapitates Private Rice, his head dropping to the ground in front of an emotional Chloe. Marv pleads as Lord Drakkon then begins to order the execution of everyone. Eventually Marv convinces Lord Drakkon that the Hyperforce Rangers will submit to his will and Lord Drakkon lets most of the remaining prisoners and soldiers go, but not before placing an explosive collar around Colonel Song's neck and threatening to blow her up should they have a change of heart. As the survivors leave one of the rescued members of \"The Coinless\", Zack Taylor, promises that this isn't over and tells the Hyperforce Rangers that he'll send for help. As Lord Drakkon, the Hyperforce Rangers and the Ranger Sentries make their way to the last known location of Serpentera a few of the Hyperforce Rangers try to make small talk with Lord Drakkon. As Marv distracts Lord Drakkon, Eddie manages to scan the bomb around Colonel Song's neck and send schematics to Alpha 55. Marv convinces Lord Drakkon to let Eddie heal Jack with the healing charge technology, but as Alpha 55 responds back about receiving the schematics Lord Drakkon becomes annoyed and threatens to detonate the bomb if the Hyperforce Rangers continue their shenanigans. As the group makes their way to Scorpina's base and what appears to be a mountain range, Vesper tries to negotiate the safety of the other Hyperforce Rangers further angering Lord Drakkon and forcing Jack to step in. A pair of Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries from guard towers order Lord Drakkon and the Hyperforce Rangers to surrender. Lord Drakkon demands the Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries to stand down and submit to his will. When the Ranger Sentries ignore his command, Lord Drakkon destroys both Ranger Sentries and the guard towers with a series of kicks. As the alarms sound, Eddie is forced to team up with Lord Drakkon and fight back to back. Lord Drakkon's attention is caught as he witnesses Chloe goes into her Pink Battle Warrior form and use one of her whirlwind attacks to take out a pair of Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries. Marv defeats the remaining Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentry while Lord Drakkon's Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentries gain entry into the side of the mountain range. The Hyperforce Rangers are alarmed by the dark aura. As Chloe begins to break down Marv promises her that he will not allow any more deaths to happen this day. As Eddie gets ahead of Lord Drakkon's Ranger Sentries he is nearly cut down by a saw when he accidentally triggers a trap. The Ranger Sentries warn the Hyperforce Rangers to not run ahead like fools. After failing to make small talk with Lord Drakkon and having a conversation about trust with Eddie, Vesper tries to trigger all the traps at once with her Cerberus Disc, breaking her weapon. Eddie picks up the remains of Vesper's weapon. Not impressed, Lord Drakkon motions them to continue onward. Misunderstanding Lord Drakkon's demands, some of the Hyperforce Rangers begin to bow to Lord Drakkon while others defy him. Lord Drakkon becomes further annoyed by the delay and demands that the Hyperforce Rangers move towards the bow of Serpentera. Vesper continues to ping her location to \"The Coinless\" as Scorpina confronts Lord Drakkon. Scorpina orders the Ranger Sentries loyal to her to make their way to the nearest city to murder the entire population. Vesper and Marv stay inside Serpentera to help Lord Drakkon as the other Hyperforce Rangers chase after Scorpina's Ranger Sentries to stop them. As Chloe makes her way out one of the Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentries turn on the others and frees Colonel Song from the bomb around her neck. Chloe then punches the mystery Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry out cold to maintain his cover as a double agent. Eddie takes the bomb while he and Chloe call upon their Hyper Zords to take out the Ranger Sentry trucks heading to the city. Chloe destroys one of the trucks with her Phoenix Hyper Zord while Eddie uses his Serpent Hyper Zord to launch the bomb to destroy another one of the trucks. Jack and Colonel Song make their way to the city as Eddie saves many of the civilians with his Hyper Zord. Jack calls upon his Hyper Zord to deal with the remaining Ranger Sentry trucks. Chloe picks up one of the trucks filled with bombs and tosses it to its destruction. Colonel Song then jumps on board one of the trucks and disarms a Mastodon Ranger Sentry of his rocket launcher before launching the rocket at another Ranger Sentry. The Ranger Sentry goes hurling into the side of another truck, rocket embedded in his chest, destroying the truck. Abandoning the truck, the remaining Mastodon Ranger Sentry crashes the truck with Colonel Song on board into the side of Jack's Hyper Zord, badly injuring Colonel Song in the explosion. Colonel Song limps away as the Mastodon Ranger Sentry pursues. After a brief scuffle Colonel Song emerges victorious and defeats the Ranger Sentry. Meanwhile back at the mountain range, the mountain range begins to rise into the sky revealing itself to be Serpentera. Lord Drakkon kicks down the door to Serpentera's cockpit hitting Scorpina upside the head. Marv and Lord Drakkon team up and defeat Scorpina, blasting Scorpina outside of Serpentera. Lord Drakkon then grabs Scorpina as Marv uses a pair of restraints to cuff Scorpina. Lord Drakkon attempts to kill Scorpina, but is stopped by Marv. Marv, mistaking this Scorpina as the Scorpina of \"The Alliance\" due to all the alternate universe talk, disagrees with Lord Drakkon thinking that Scorpina might be more useful alive. Finally deciding that he has had enough of Marv, Lord Drakkon attempts to take Marv's morpher. Scorpina laughs at Marv while attempting to topple all three of them off of Serpentera to their deaths. Lord Drakkon manages to save himself while holding onto Scorpina, but Marv falls off the side of Serpentera. Chloe attempts to save Marv, but comes under fire from enemy Ranger Sentry planes. Luckily for Marv another airship shows up in time piloted by Bulk of \"The Coinless\", who saves him from certain death. While all this is going on, Vesper names one of the Ranger Sentries Georgie as she attempts to hack into Serpentera to reprogram it. The first attempt isn't successful and Vesper is badly injured. Vesper attempts to heal herself by repeatedly morphing,  but only succeeds in badly injuring Georgie with the morphed explosions. After a second attempt Vesper is successful in reprogramming Serpentera and sends it on a collision course with the ocean going at full speed. Lord Drakkon jumps inside Serpentera and decides that he is going to finish off Vesper once and for all. Against all advice from Alpha 55, Eddie risks death by doing a blind teleport through solid matter into Serpentera. As Eddie appears to save Vesper, Vesper jumps in front of Lord Drakkon to protect Eddie. Using the blunt end of the saber that is the headless corpse of Saba, Lord Drakkon slices off Vesper's left arm. Eddie grabs hold of Vesper and teleports away as her arm falls to the ground. Serpentera slams into the ocean in a massive impact explosion killing Georgie as Chloe finishes off the remaining Ranger Sentry planes attacking the time ship. At near-death, Vesper is rushed to the medical bay of the time ship carried by Eddie as she begins to lose consciousnesses from the massive blood loss. Using the healing charge technology, Eddie stabilizes Vesper and he begins work on making Vesper a prosthesis arm. At the crash site of Serpentera, Lord Drakkon emerges with an unconscious Scorpina in hand. A Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry informs Lord Drakkon that Serpentera will be repaired and operational within a month. Back at the time ship Alpha 55 informs the Hyperforce Rangers that he has received a message and that they must time travel further into the future of this alternate reality or all will be lost. The Hyperforce Rangers' time ship then enters the hyper stream to jump further ahead in time of this alternate reality. To be continued in the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n----\nNotes: 1. Zac Eubank reprises his role as a guest [[gamemaster|Game Master]] due to Malika Lim reprising her guest player role during this episode.\n\n2. A direct continuation of the previous episode; this episode is also based on the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n\n3. This marks the first time Jason David Frank has portrayed his evil comic book counterpart [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Lord Drakkon]] in any official capacity beyond an advertisement for the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n\n4. It was announced at the end of this episode that the conclusion to the ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' story within the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event would take place within the actual ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' comics from [[Boom! Studios]] themselves. Due to this, the next episode takes place after the resolution of the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n\n5. It was also announced during this episode that ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' would receive a special bonus episode separate from the 25 main story episodes that were scheduled.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 21\n |Title = Enter The Green Ranger\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Hyperforce Green Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|27}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers are on board the time ship traveling through the hyper stream discussing \"The Leader\" when Marv notices that the strap on his morpher is torn. Confused, the Hyperforce Rangers look around and Vesper freaks out at the sight of her severed arm. In its place, Vesper finds a less elegant, robotic prosthetic arm of 3-D printed parts colored black and chrome. While lacking the pioneering eloquence of Vesper's original synthetic organic limb, Eddie finds through experimentation of the limb's buttons that the arm is none the less technologically advanced in its own right by featuring various weapon systems. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to look around for changes Marv asks Alpha 55 if the time ship may have experienced a time anomaly. Vesper, however, comes to the conclusion that Alpha 55 intentionally cut her arm off out of jealousy and attempts to take it out on him. As Alpha 55 breaks away he reminds Vesper that if anyone has been dismantling anyone it was her while pointing out his missing ankles used for the Hyperforce Rangers' weapons. Chloe becomes envious of Vesper's new prosthetic arm and asks Marv to cut off her arm so that she can also get a prosthetic. Looking through the data Marv comes to the conclusion that nearly a month's worth of time is unaccounted for and Alpha 55 discovers numerous messages from Joe. In the first message, Joe announces that he and Nadira have set a wedding date and invites the Hyperforce Rangers to attend. In the second message, Joe states that Jen Scotts wants to meet with him about something important. As the messages continue on Joe becomes more worried about not receiving a reply back and explains that he is setting out to find the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship. In the final message, Joe mentions that he has mysteriously woken up back in bed on his wedding day and that he has no recollection of the missing time. The Hyperforce Rangers return to the year 3017 and scramble to prepare for the wedding ceremony in time with Eddie leading the way. At the wedding reception, Marv and Jack remain uneasy about the loss of time and Marv attempts to pull Joe aside to talk, but with little success. Upon learning about the food Chloe sneaks away and begins to secretly eat the wedding cake before the cutting. Vesper meanwhile goes off to a corner of the room with Eddie; still fuming about Alpha 55 and her missing arm. Marv attempts to dance with several of the women, but with little success. As Marv asks for advice about what he is doing wrong, Vesper attempts to set Marv up with Chloe. After coming upon and startling Chloe, Marv discovers that Chloe's face is covered in frosting and her mouth is fully engorged with cake. Jack steps in wondering what the commotion is all about. After Marv shows off his dance moves Chloe reveals that women won't dance with him because his facial expression makes it look like he is farting. As Chloe attempts to help Marv by slapping the expression off of his face Joe discovers the partially ate cake and screams at Chloe. Chloe rubs the cake from her hands and face onto Abigail and attempts to pass the blame onto her while taking off. Finally getting a chance to talk, Joe reveals to the Hyperforce Rangers that he is going to join them on their mission to stop \"The Alliance\" on a more permanent basis. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to make small talk at the wedding reception they receive an incoming message from Alpha 55. Vesper takes the message and further antagonizes Alpha 55 while it is revealed that an individual known as [[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Sentinel Knight]] needs their help immediately. The Hyperforce Rangers and Joe are forced to leave the wedding reception early; much to Nadira's disappointment. As the time ship enters the hyper stream and goes off to the month of December in the year 2007 the Hyperforce Rangers and Joe learn from Eddie about Sentinel Knight and the Corona Aurora; the Crown of the Gods. Vesper questions how Joe could possibly help to which Joe reveals a new morpher from Jen Scotts. Chloe becomes somber as she reflects upon the wedding and begins to think of what her wedding might one day be like without her parents. Marv tells Chloe that maybe the Corona Aurora might be able to bring her parents back to her. In 2007 the Hyperforce Rangers find the Sentinel Knight at the Neda Waterfalls in Kyparissia, Greece. Sentinel Knight informs the Hyperforce Rangers that after the Operation Overdrive Rangers had recovered the Corona Aurora he hid the crown on Aquatar, but now some dark entity is trying to claim it. The time ship makes its way to Aquatar with the Sentinel Knight as Chloe freaks as she finds out that Burrito the dog has eaten all of her \"aged\" burritos and swollen to ten times his previous size. Elsewhere in the universe \"The Leader\" is accompanied by Scorpina, Velchanos, and four mysterious aliens, two snorting like pigs, as he recruits Lokar to \"The Alliance\" cause. On Aquatar the Sentinel Knight leads the Hyperforce Rangers to a dormant volcano where they see two mysterious blue pig aliens. The Hyperforce Rangers learn from Sentinel Knight that the aliens are Hydro Jr. and Hogz Jr.; the offspring of the deceased [[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers|Hydro Hog]], Emperor of the Dark Waters. As the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to sneak up the volcano Joe is spotted and has the water sucked out of his body. The Hyperforce Rangers morph and attack the two aliens, but both prove to be formidable. Eddie attempts to use his water abilities to return the stolen water from the aliens to Joe's body but is damaged. Jack frees Eddie from the aliens' grasp and Vesper breaks her Cerberus Axe while pulling it out. Vesper takes note to make Alpha 55 pay for it later. Joe morphs into the Hyperforce Green Ranger for the first time and lunges at Hydro Jr. in a barrage of sword strikes. Eddie fires a rocket from Vesper's robotic arm and topples Hogz Jr. to the ground. Marv and Jack attempt to cryo-freeze the pair but they manage to dodge with minimal damage. As Sentinel Knight is dragged up the volcano by Hogz Jr. Jack rams into the alien sending him flying. Jack and Sentinel Knight hurry to the volcano's peak and jump in to retrieve the Corona Aurora. As they land Sentinel Knight nearly loses his footing near the magma's edge and is steadied by Jack. Chloe's whirlwind attack backfires as her leg is grabbed by Hydro Jr. and both are buried in the sand. Eddie frees Chloe by giving her super strength with his experimental \"Birthrito\", a birthday cake burrito combination, before slamming the pair of aliens near the base of the volcano with a \"water hand\" attack that kills one of them. With Hydro Jr. dead Hogz Jr. tries to escape but is cryo-frozen by Marv. With the water frozen inside him, Hogz Jr. shatters to pieces and dies. As Jack and Sentinel Knight escape with the Corona Aurora in hand the volcano erupts. Eddie and Chloe combine their water and wind powers to buy the needed time for the team to escape the pyroclastic flow. Back on board the time ship the Hyperforce Rangers observe the formation of \"Burrito Island\". Chloe decides not to use the Corona Aurora to revive her parents partly because she believes them to be alive and partly out of fear that they may come back as zombies if they were deceased. Chloe instead asks Sentinel Knight to give her the robot arm from her drawing. Sentinel Knight avoids the request by tricking Chloe to go build it herself. Vesper also makes a request of Sentinel Knight to have both of her broken weapons repaired and for her old arm back while blaming Alpha 55. Sentinel Knight also avoids fulfilling these requests when Alpha 55 chimes in that he'll just repair Vesper's weapons. As Alpha 55 walks away with the broken weapons in hand Vesper warns him that she'll be watching him. The time ship makes its way back to earth in the year 2007 to drop Sentinel Knight back home as Eddie connects the time ship's hologram emitters to the wedding reception in the year 3017 so that Joe can have his first dance with his wife Nadira. Elsewhere \"The Leader\" looks upon earth in the year 2007 from his dark chamber on board the stolen time ship. He vows he will destroy the Sentinel Knight and claim the Corona Aurora for himself.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |Title = Fight for the Corona Aurora\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Hyperforce Green Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|04|03}}\n | ShortSummary= As Joe continues to dance with his wife Nadira through the hologram transmission from 3017 Vesper tells Sentinel Knight that he owes her a favor. Vesper tries to gain access to the crown as the Sentinel Knight warns the Hyperforce Rangers of the dangers of any evil entity that attempts to obtain the Corona Aurora at all costs. Jack has Alpha 55 scan the Corona Aurora's power and asks Alpha 55 to keep him informed of any time anomalies. Marv talks to Sentinel Knight about the Knight's past with the Operation Overdrive Rangers and asks for help to become stronger with his power to combine as a Battlizer. Sentinel Knight tells Marv to look toward his inner strength, but promises to help train him. Vesper makes small talk with Eddie, then [[psychological manipulation|attempts]] to [[emotional blackmail|coerce]] him into [[guilt trip|helping]] her get a hold of the Corona Aurora. Eddie decides that helping Vesper wouldn't be a good idea. So Vesper contemplates getting Chloe's help, but tries to give her dog Burrito to Sentinel Knight instead. After that fails and Chloe also refuses to help, Vesper simply asks Sentinel Knight to touch the crown all the while throwing Eddie under the bus by suggesting that it was his idea. Vesper wishes for a Battlizer as she touches the crown, but nothing happens. Vesper however does make note to scan a blueprint of the Corona Aurora's physical dimensions and external appearance into her memory. Arriving back at the Neda Waterfalls in Kyparissia, Greece in the year 2007, Sentinel Knight begins to train Marv. As Marv and Sentinel Knight train \"The Leader\" sends forth the monster [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Doomstone]]. Marv wields the sword [[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Excelsior]], now no longer merged with Sentinel Knight's body, against Doomstone. Before Marv can attack Doomstone however the monster revives two other fallen monsters that had been destroyed by past Power Rangers and runs away. The first fallen monster the Hyperforce Rangers see they instantly recognize as the Shibarai. The other fallen monster however, [[Power Rangers Ninja Storm|Beevil]], is one the Hyperforce Rangers do not recognize. Vesper summons her Cerberus Disc, but starts to berate Alpha 55 after finding that it is still broken. Eddie takes the broken pieces and begins to work on them as Vesper fights Beevil. Marv attempts to use Excelsior, but then realizes from his memory that the sword will only work with an artificial life form. Marv hands the sword to Vesper who uses it to become the Black Sentinel Ranger. As Eddie completes repairing and upgrading the Cerberus Disc into a spinning top, he is surprised to see Vesper has become the Black Sentinel Ranger. \"The Leader\" uses his power to send down beams of dark energy making the Shibarai and Beevil grow. Jack summons his Crius Cannon to attack Beevil's knee and Joe follows up by attacking the same knee. Sentinel Knight uses his energy to enhance the Hyperforce Rangers abilities. As Chloe's team attack with Vesper fails, Eddie summons his Serpent Hyper Zord and unleashes a pair of water fists attacks on the monsters. Beevil takes the brunt of the damage as Shibarai manages to repel the water fist attack. Annoyed, \"The Leader\" sends down Velchanos and a squad of Putties to steal the Corona Aurora from Sentinel Knight while the Hyperforce Rangers are distracted. Hearing the Putties, Joe senses that Sentinel Knight is in danger and rushes in. Joe arrives in time to lend one of his Hydra Blades to an already injured Sentinel Knight, who uses the blade to knock Velchanos back. After being rammed by Jack's Ram Hyper Zord, Vesper uses the Cerberus Zord to finish off Beevil. In a last-ditch attempt before exploding Beevil tries to pull Vesper out of her cockpit, but fails. The Hyperforce Rangers summon the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord and grab the Shibarai. With the monster within their grasp, they blast the Shibarai at point-blank range with repeated flamethrower bursts and a barrage of missiles, causing the Shibarai to shrink back down to human size from the damage. Joe takes out several of the Putties as Velchanos steals the Corona Aurora from Sentinel Knight. As \"The Leader\" arrives to claim the crown from Velchanos he becomes distracted by his obsession of destroying the Sentinel Knight. Joe calls for assistance as he attacks Velchanos. Running away, the Shibarai arrives at the location of \"The Leader\" with the Hyperforce Rangers close behind. Annoyed at the Shibarai's incompetence, \"The Leader\" drains the rest of the Shibarai's energy; destroying the monster. The Hyperforce Rangers partially heal Sentinel Knight using the healing charge technology as Vesper attempts to trick Velchanos into giving up the Corona Aurora by making a duplicate hologram crown from her memory. \"The Leader\" attempts to strip the decoy crown from Vesper's grasp and becomes aware of the ploy. \"The Leader\" body slams Vesper to the ground with the full force of his dark energy. Sentinel Knight comes to Vesper's aid by attacking \"The Leader\", but falls upon Vesper instead. After Jack's Ram Hyper Zord missile attack fails to knock the crown from Velchanos's head, Chloe uses her Phoenix Hyper Zord to pin him in between a pair of feathers, Joe and Marv. Using a combined attack Joe and Marv manage to strip the Corona Aurora from Velchanos. As Marv makes a run for it with the Corona Aurora in hand Eddie professes his love for Vesper while giving his Serpent Hyper Zord's all to destroy \"The Leader\". Vesper tells Eddie that she loves him with all her heart as \"The Leader\" easily brushes off the damage. Now knowing what Eddie cares for the most, \"The Leader\" unleashes the full force of his dark energy into Vesper at point blank range. The dark energy surges into and flows through Vesper's body, rattling her synthetic bones. Unable to contain the energy, it begins to spill out, burning and bursting forth through gaping wounds within Vesper's body and ricocheting off her Black Sentinel Ranger armor. As the energy burns out of her retinas, Vesper is completely obliterated from existence.\n----\nNotes: 1. Meghan Camarena was absent from participating in this episode. Rather than make up an excuse to explain Chloe's absence as had been done in past cases where a Hyperforce Ranger couldn't play; in this case the [[gamemaster|Game Master]] Malika Lim simply chose to play Chloe as an [[non-player character|NPC]] with minimal interaction with the other Hyperforce Rangers. Meghan Camarena does make a brief cameo appearance in the episode however through the earlier filmed stock footage used for the morph sequence.\n\n2. Yoshi Sudarso is credited as a guest player in the opening title sequence for the first time. While this is not new for other guest players to have appeared in the show; in this particular case its more likely an indicator to Yoshi's more permanent inclusion into the show for the remainder of the season.\n\n3. This episode did not have a ''Fireside Chat''.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 23\n |Title = Rebirth\u2026 Kind Of\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Hyperforce Green Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|04|10}}\n | ShortSummary= Proud of the damage that he has caused by killing Vesper, \"The Leader\" escalates the battle further by chanting an incantation to create a dark force field that prevents the Hyperforce Rangers from escaping with the Corona Aurora. \"The Leader\" attempts to make a deal with the Hyperforce Rangers, the crown for their freedom and the charred corpse of Vesper. Eddie argues intensely with Marv about not giving the crown away as Chloe exits her Phoenix Hyper Zord and transforms into her Pink Battle Warrior form. Jack attempts to hit the force field with his Ram Hyper Zord, but only succeeds in damaging his Hyper Zord in the process. Desperate to puncture the force field, Marv sends out a beam of energy that ricochets back into him. Sentinel Knight tries to talk Marv into turning over the Corona Aurora, but after hearing Marv's agony in submitting to the demands of \"The Leader\" he chooses to attack instead. \"The Leader\" easily dodges as Sentinel Knight bounces off the force field. Velchanos summons more Putties, but Eddie makes quick work of them with his Serpent Hyper Zord as he threatens \"The Leader\". \"The Leader\" stomps Vesper's corpse into the ground in response to the threats as Joe runs in to attack. \"The Leader\" grabs Joe by the neck nearly killing him. As Chloe argues with Marv, who is on the verge of breaking down, she starts to hear a voice inside her head to destroy the crown. Chloe snatches the Corona Aurora from Marv's hands. Marv tries to reclaim the Corona Aurora, but fails as Chloe unleashes the full force of her attack upon the crown; vaporizing it. As the crown is destroyed Alpha 55 manages to send a message to Joe that penetrates the force field. \"The Leader\" clutches his chest in pain at the destruction of the Corona Aurora. Using the moment to his advantage, Marv rushes in and grabs both Vesper's corpse and Joe. Not wanting \"The Leader\" to escape; Chloe in her Pink Battle Warrior form along with Eddie and Jack in their Hyper Zords blasts \"The Leader\" for damage. Sentinel Knight also attacks \"The Leader\" for added damage. Eddie exits his Hyper Zord to be close to Vesper as Jack attempts again to breach the force field, but with no success. \"The Leader\" has Velchanos grow as he makes his escape. Hearing the message from Alpha 55 that his Hyper Zord is now available, Joe transfers his chest shield to Marv and calls upon the Hydra Hyper Zord. The Hydra Hyper Zord smashes through the force field. Joe and Sentinel Knight use the Hydra Hyper Zord to keep Velchanos at bay as the other Hyperforce Rangers make their way to the time ship. Eddie has Alpha 55 control the Cerberus Hyper Zord to form the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord as Chloe warns the Hyperforce Rangers never to speak of this moment to Vesper if she ever \"gets better\". After launching Velchanos into the air with a water uppercut, Velchanos reciprocates by throwing chunks of flaming rocks at the Hyperforce Rangers. The Hydra Hyper Zord hits Velchanos with laser blasts stunning him. In a symbolic act, Eddie destroys Velchanos with the Cerberus arm; smashing Velchanos with a tsunami water blast. Back on board the time ship Alpha 55 becomes distressed at the sight of Vesper's charred corpse. The time ship jumps into the hyper stream as Vesper's body is rushed to the medical bay to be scanned. Elsewhere \"The Leader\" walks toward a mysterious man in a lab coat surrounded by advanced Time Force technology. \"The Leader\" admits his failure to the mysterious man. The mysterious man is not too concerned however; stating that the destruction of the Corona Aurora only proved his theory that a [[Temporal paradox|new timeline]] had been created as \"The Leader\" was still alive. The mysterious man further elaborates that in the previous timeline \"The Leader\" was only alive because two years prior they were successful in obtaining the crown from this same confrontation that now saw its destruction. Back on board the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship as Vesper's body is scanned, Alpha 55 powers down and begins to act strangely after rebooting. Meanwhile an angry Eddie tries to punch Marv in the face for attempting to give the Corona Aurora to \"The Leader\" and allowing Chloe to destroy the crown, but is stopped mid-swing by Chloe grabbing his arm. As Eddie breaks down crying Joe comforts Eddie. Sentinel Knight magically takes his leave of the time ship to go back to his time of 2007 to prepare in case the worst possible situation occurs as a result of these recent events. Jack examines footage of \"The Leader\" to see if he can figure out what his exact deal is following the recent events. Chloe helps Joe heal with medical supplies and an old burrito she found from under her bed. Eddie looks at old photos of Vesper as Marv tries to console him and Eddie comes up with an epiphany. Eddie goes off to find Jack who has come to a similar epiphany. Eddie begins searching for a point in time where \"The Leader\" can absorb massive amounts of good and bad energy connected to the Morphin Grid. Elsewhere in the time ship Vesper's consciousness comes online inside of Alpha 55 absent of all of her memories. Vesper begins to harvest all the knowledge from Alpha 55's memory as well as all knowledge of the Alphas that came before. As Vesper begins to freak out the Hyperforce Rangers come running to see why Alpha 55 is screaming. Alpha 55 tells the Hyperforce Rangers that she is really Vesper as Marv comes in with Vesper's corpse after Joe tells him to bring it. Vesper yells at the Hyperforce Rangers for destroying her body and argues out loud with the voice of Alpha 55 inside her head. Chloe and Eddie pass out from the revelation. Feeling uncomfortable in this new form, Vesper has Alpha 55 put on her bra and panties to feel more like her old self. Alpha 55 reveals to Vesper that her secret project away from the Hyperforce Rangers under the ruse of \"sleeping\" from an earlier time was really her creating a back-up copy of her consciousness should she ever die. Unfortunately because the back-up was made at an earlier time, the memories in the back-up were not kept up to date to the present time of her body's death. Joe nicknames Alpha 55 and Vesper sharing a body \"Vespa\" and the Hyperforce Rangers discuss way to help get Vesper a new body. Vesper refuses to have anything to do with her old body since its now gross and she doesn't want to be a zombie, so \"Vespa\" tries several times to throw it away. \"Vespa\" then takes Vesper's morpher and tries to morph, but is unable to due to not having DNA anymore to activate the morpher's unlock sequence. Eddie heals Joe further with the healing charge technology and \"Vespa\" shocks Joe for annoying Vesper in various ways; such as requesting repeatedly to dye her hair black. Checking with Alpha 55's data for a point in time that \"The Leader\" may use to obtain large amounts of energy at Eddie's request, Vesper and the other Hyperforce Rangers become aware of the Red Space Ranger Andros and the United Alliance of Evil. Eddie and Jack decide that getting Vesper a new body should be their first priority and come to the conclusion that the destroyed lab of the late Dr. Fericks in the year 3017 would be the best place to start. Vesper takes a moment alone to mourn her old body as Alpha 55 informs her that it may be possible to retrieve her old memories from the chip embedded within her skull. Marv takes a moment to apologize to Chloe for his earlier actions with the Corona Aurora. The Hyperforce Rangers contact Time Force and requests for the help of all available man power throughout time and space. The Hyperforce Rangers then have the time ship travel to the year 3017 to comb through the destroyed lab before going to pick up their potential allies to stop \"The Alliance\" in the year 1998. Meanwhile already in the year 1998 on the Cimmerian Planet \"The Leader\" walks among the various leaders of the United Alliance of Evil at Dark Specter's gathering spot. \"The Leader\" comes across Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, who become curious as to who would dare approach them. \"The Leader\" lowers his hood revealing dark energy pulsing from his exposed brain and heavily bandaged face; declaring that he will restore his family's legacy and that Zordon must not be allowed to die. Back on board the Hyperforce Ranger's time ship \"Vespa\" feels up and down his arms as Vesper's consciousness probes Alpha 55's mind of his darkest secret to which Alpha 55 replies that it is his confusion of Vesper's sporadic intentions.\n----\nNotes: 1. Zac Eubank has a brief [[non-player character|NPC]] cameo appearance in this episode, portraying the mysterious man in a lab coat.\n\n2.

As he begins to make his way to the dinner table he is grabbed by Joe and is teleported to the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship. Confused as to what has happened, the Hyperforce Rangers try to fill Andros in on the threat of \"The Leader\" while delicately trying to avoid altering history. On board the time ship Andros meets other allies of the Hyperforce Rangers that have traversed time and space to come and help upon receiving the Hyperforce Rangers' message: the wizard [[Merlin]], the [[Power Rangers S.P.D.|S.P.D.]] B-Squad Green Ranger Detective Lina Song, the Mighty Morphin Yellow Ranger Aisha and the RPM Ranger Operator Series Gold Gem. After the allies get caught up on the Hyperforce Rangers' exploits with \"The Leader\" and Vesper's current situation with being stuck inside Alpha 55, the group goes over the plan to stop \"The Alliance\" from altering history by using a hologram to trick \"The Leader\" into being blown up with explosives. Gem reveals that he has set up more explosives around the perimeter of the United Alliance of Evil meeting place as a backup plan while he builds additional explosives for the group to use. Andros decides to continue on as if he were still on his original mission to rescue Zordon while the Hyperforce Rangers go about their plans to stop \"The Leader\". Vesper puts Alpha 55 on speaker so that the rest of the group can hear him and prepares the hologram of Marv while the group teleports to the dinner meeting. As they prepare to make their move the Hyperforce Rangers notice multiple time ships appearing in the sky. At first the Hyperforce Rangers are confused, but come to an educated conclusion that these time ships are likely the ones stolen by \"The Alliance\" and not additional reinforcements from Time Force. The Hyperforce Rangers recognize \"The Leader\" as he approaches Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd. \"The Leader\" reveals his true identity to Rita and Zedd as their son [[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Thrax]]. Before the Hyperforce Rangers can react to Thrax, Dark Specter appears. Dark Specter reveals to the United Alliance of Evil that he has Zordon prisoner and is draining him of his energy. Andros attempts to distract Thrax by trying to throw his hood over his head, but is grabbed by Thrax instead. Thrax impertinently proclaims his superiority to the crowd of villains at being the ultimate evil while the Hyperforce Rangers set off the perimeter explosives as a distraction and Chloe transforms into her Pink Battle Warrior form. Joe strikes Thrax in the back causing him to drop Andros. Merlin suggests to Marv that this might be the perfect time to launch the Marv hologram. Vesper grows increasingly annoyed at being referred to as Alpha 55, but eventually complies by launching the Marv hologram. Eddie and Jack reach Zordon and try to explain the situation with time being altered while trying to save him. Jack tells Vesper to quit wasting time by asking for wishes from Zordon and to scan him for making a potential Zordon hologram to use in the future. As one of the stolen time ships gets close to Zordon, members of \"The Alliance\" launch themselves toward Zordon. \"Vespa\" has Alpha 55's chest lower and blast one of \"The Alliance\" members sending him hurling off into space. Eddie and Chloe successively combine their power to freeze the lava draining Zordon's power. Jack attempts to expel the lava elsewhere, but fails. Chloe has Jack launch her in the air and she uses her Hyperion Bow to take out the remaining members of \"The Alliance\" coming towards Zordon. Zordon lends a little of his strength to Eddie to power up his Oceanus Trident. Gem and Goldar clash in a head on head battle, but Gem is dazed as he is knocked to the ground. Aisha tries to distract Goldar with a dance as Andros uses his Galaxy Glider to strike Goldar. Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd discuss Thrax's potential to succeed and replace Dark Specter. Divatox and Elgar take cover under one of the tables as the various factions of the United Alliance of Evil are left confused in the chaos of the various attacks. Merlin lends his power to Marv to make the Marv hologram look more spectacular and distract Thrax. Annoyed, Thrax begins to drain the crowd of villains of their energy; killing Elgar, the Machine Empire's Royal House of Gadgetry and groups of Quantrons in the process. As Goldar is distracted by the Marv hologram Andros, Gem and Aisha do a combined pincer attack on board the Galaxy Glider to knock Goldar unconscious on the ground. Astronema keeps her distance observing the situation as Gem declares his victory over Goldar. Dark Specter confronts \"Vespa\" and Chloe in the middle of a conversation about Vesper missing her head of hair. Vesper remarks that Dark Specter is familiar to their deceased volcanic foe Velchanos. Eddie and Jack try to convince Dark Specter to destroy Thrax. Dark Specter does not trust the Hyperforce Rangers, but agrees that Thrax must be eliminated. As the Marv hologram continues to make a mockery of Thrax's abilities Dark Specter laughs at Thrax. Enraged, Thrax begins to absorb Dark Specter's energy. Marv and Joe attempt to boost Dark Specter's power. Thrax decides he has had enough and launches the full force of the energy back into Dark Specter's chest obliterating him. As Chloe quips about Dark Specter's death in retaliation for being silenced earlier by him Vesper decides to take this inopportune moment to ask why Eddie doesn't look at her in the same romantic way as \"Vespa\" despite wearing her best undergarments to get his attention. One of the stolen time ships swoops in and grabs Zordon with a gigantic claw. the stolen time ship attempts to pull Zordon inside as Eddie, Chloe and \"Vespa\" grab hold of Zordon, but only Chloe manages to maintain hold. The Hyperforce Rangers, Andros, Aisha, Gem, Song and Merlin unleash the full force of their attacks upon Thrax. Thrax attempts to absorb their attack, but becomes overwhelmed by the power. Thrax falls over in a massive explosion, unleashing a wave of dark energy upon Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, strengthening them. Rita and Zedd decide that a direct attack with their new found dark powers may not be wise without a plan and teleport away. The members of \"The Alliance\" on board the stolen time ship shoot Chloe off of Zordon's tube. As Chloe falls she calls upon her Phoenix Hyper Zord and attempts to break the claw holding Zordon, but accidentally knocks Zordon into the stolen time ship instead. Andros, Gem, Aisha, Merlin and Song decide to stay back and hold off the few survivors of the United Alliance of Evil as the Hyperforce Rangers escape to their time ship and chase after Zordon. Aisha thrashes Divatox like a rag doll while Astronema attacks Andros. Joe fails to put a tracker on the stolen time ship with Zordon, but an inner voice speaks to Chloe. Recognizing the voice as the same one who told her to destroy the Corona Aurora, Chloe pinpoints the stolen time ship with Zordon. As the course of time continues to be severely altered from the unfolding events the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship sets chase for Zordon.\n----\nNote: Due to the combined large number of both regular players and guest players featured during this episode not everyone could appear on screen at the same time.

Chloe confirms her certainty and Marv asks \"Vespa\" how close Vesper's new body is to completion using the technology that was found in Dr. Fericks burned down lab from the year 3017. Alpha 55 replies that it will be a few more hours before the body is completed. As the group makes their way into the stolen time ship Chloe inspects each of the rooms. The Hyperforce Rangers find a mysterious man in a lab coat locked behind a force field. As the Hyperforce Rangers free the mysterious man from the force field Chloe recognizes him as her father Mr. Ashford. Mr. Ashford tells Chloe that he had been contacting her through her locket and that he was the voice that she had been hearing in her head. Chloe asks about her mother, but begins to break down when Mr. Ashford tells Chloe that she is dead. Mr. Ashford leads the Hyperforce Rangers to the back of the stolen time ship telling them that Zordon is too powerful to keep at the front of the ship due to the interference with the electronics. As Mr. Ashford continues to talk to the Hyperforce Rangers about Time Force Alpha 55 detects a Time Force energy signal trying to access the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship controls. Mr. Ashford comments under his breath that \"she\" is ahead of schedule and drops a force field in between himself and the Hyperforce Rangers. Mr. Ashford tells the Hyperforce Rangers that there is no use trying to teleport back to their time ship because Scorpina has disabled the controls. Mr. Ashford warns Scorpina by communicator as Vesper downloads her consciousness from Alpha 55 into her partially completed body on board the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship where she regains the memories of her past life and death from her the charred memory chip of her original body. Vesper makes her way to the control room and confronts Scorpina, who has the Time Force Red Ranger Wes hostage. Vesper tries to strangle Scorpina with her own hair, but Scorpina breaks free by cutting off her own hair with her nails. Mr. Ashford threatens to destroy the remaining Time Force Rangers unless he gets some alone time with Chloe. The Hyperforce Rangers come to the conclusion that if Chloe complies with his demand it may prove to be distraction enough to save the Time Force Rangers from their captivity. As Chloe transforms into her Pink Battle Warrior form Alpha 55 pilots the Phoenix Hyper Zord and takes Marv, Joe, Jack and Eddie to each of the other stolen time ships with Time Force signatures. Eddie enters one of the stolen time ships. On board Eddie quickly disarms and tosses a member of \"The Alliance\" into a room, locking him inside by barring the now broken door knob with the member's own weapon. Before Eddie can free the prisoner he becomes trapped in an illusion of a deserted island with Vesper. Realizing this can't be real, Eddie body slams the illusion of Vesper and begins to follow the voice of the prisoner he hears as the island begins to flood. Jack enters another one of the stolen time ships and is injured by Goldar, who has now joined \"The Alliance\" on their mission. Jack damages Goldar's wing with his Crius Cannon as Goldar in turn jabs Jack in the shoulder. Jack blasts the access panel allowing the Time Force Yellow Ranger Katie to bust through the door of her prison cell. Annoyed that Goldar has interrupted her conversation with Jack, Katie punches Goldar upside the face. On another stolen time ship Marv and Joe break down a door finding Doomstone trying to revive Thrax back to life. Combining their attack, Doomstone is knocked to the ground and the Time Force Blue Ranger Lucas is freed. As Joe and Lucas get into it over love interest with Nadira Marv is left uncomfortable and Doomstone takes the opportunity to leave. They then manage to catch up with Doomstone in the control room. Back on board the first stolen time ship Chloe demands answers from her father. Mr. Ashford sidesteps Chloe's questions about her mother, only stating that she fell to her death. Mr. Ashford tells Chloe that he has been planning this for a long time, though some things will need cleaned up as not everything has gone to plan with Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd unexpectedly being powered up by Thrax's death. He then tells Chloe that the stolen time ships are programmed to self destruct if they can't escape through the time stream within ten minutes time. Chloe warns the other Hyperforce Rangers of the self destruct sequence. Back on the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship Scorpina hits Vesper as she fails to back-flip out of the way. Wes morphs and strikes Scorpina with some laser blasts. Vesper drags Scorpina by her leg to the airlock as Burrito the dog bites Scorpina's face. As Vesper continues to hold Scorpina in place Wes stomps her in the stomach. Wes gets tired of Vesper's antics with Scorpina and jettisons Scorpina from the airlock into an unknown point in the time stream. Back in the illusion, Eddie uses his Zordon enhanced Oceanus Trident to dispel the illusion and accidentally hits the Time Force Green Ranger Trip. Lokar uses his mental powers to mess with Trip and Eddie's minds by making a hole appear. Eddie uses his Oceanus Trident to dispel the illusion yet again. Eddie uses hologram technology enhanced by Trip's psychic powers to make a team of Time Force and Hyperforce Rangers with Eddie's face to distract Lokar. As the back of the stolen time ship opens up revealing Lokar, the holograms begin to malfunction and shrink. The shrinking holograms and Eddie lunge at Lokar. Eddie strikes Lokar causing him to disappear in the time stream in an explosion of black feathers. Eddie and Trip make their way to the control center and recover Trip's morpher. As the stolen time ship becomes unstable and starts to crash Alpha 55 picks the pair up. Trip is marveled by the fact that his design of the Phoenix Hyper Zord is now a reality. Back on board one of the other stolen time ships Jack hits Goldar in the face and Katie hits him in the abdomen. Katie catches and snaps Goldar's sword in two with her super strength. Jack uses the Crius Hammer to smack Goldar unconscious while ripping off his remaining wing. As Katie busts through multiple walls to claim her morpher Jack decides to ask her out for coffee. Alpha 55 picks up the pair of Yellow Rangers before the stolen time ship crashes. On another stolen time ship Marv drills through Doomstone's eye and body reclaiming Lucas's morpher from the control panel. As the time ship crashes the group of three runs to escape with Lucas and Joe both trying to \"accidentally\" leave the other behind. On board the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship and the Phoenix Hyper Zord the group of Rangers makes their way back to save Chloe from the remaining stolen time ship. Chloe becomes enraged at Mr. Ashford's responses and a whirlwind begins to threaten the destruction of the stolen time ship. Chloe begins to calm herself, still feeling her mother's presence and starts to notice little tells that her father may not have been entirely truthful with her. As Mr. Ashford teleports away Chloe attacks the force field and is knocked unconscious. As the Hyperforce Rangers enter stolen time ship and save Chloe, Eddie revives her with the healing charge technology. As the group enters the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship the remaining stolen time ships not destroyed disappear into the time stream. The group of Rangers decide that the best course of action is to go back to the year 3017, but before they can do that they will have to first pick up their other allies. The Hyperforce Rangers are unable to contact or locate Andros, but they manage to get hold of Aisha. Aisha begs for the Hyperforce Rangers to send her back to an earlier time before the dinner party took place from which she can warn Zordon, but the Time Force Rangers disagree stating that doing so would not solve problem currently at hand because time travel doesn't work that way. Alpha 55 teleports Merlin, Aisha, Song and Gem on board and the Time Force Rangers forcefully wipes their memories, despite much protest from the allies, in an attempt to best preserve what remains of the original timeline before returning them home. Seeing the technology to wipe minds at work Vesper begs the Time Force Rangers to use it on her, anguished by seeing and feeling the memories of herself burn to death on and endless loop in her mind. Trip tells her that it is impossible because her mind doesn't work like an organic mind, but perhaps one day remembering her experience would help her grow as a person. Vesper tells Eddie to find and erase every last back-up copy she has made of herself because if she were ever to die again she would prefer to remain dead instead of coming back even worse off than she is now. As Trip looks through the history records he concludes that the United Alliance of Evil dinner took place eight months before Zordon's death, meaning they have eight months to make things right before the time alterations become permanent. As their allies are dropped off one by one in their respective times and dimensions, the Hyperforce Rangers discover that Song has disappeared from the time ship. The Time Force Rangers and Hyperforce Rangers search the entire time ship, but are unable to locate her. Chloe decides to go off to be by herself for a while to think about things with her father. Back in the year 3017 the group finds three giant sculptures of Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd and Thrax. The group is confronted and shot at by an alternate timeline version of Jen Scotts from \"The Resistance\". As Lucas inquires about the alternate Nadira of this timeline, they learn from alternate Jen that \"The Resistance\" wants to bring about the downfall of Lady Nadira. The Time Force Rangers decide to stay in the 3017 to help \"The Resistance\" and Marv gives them a communicator to stay in touch. As the Hyperforce Rangers board the time ship they say their goodbyes as Trip hugs Joe and Katie kisses Jack on the cheek while pushing Marv five feet away for his \"friend zone\" comment. Back at the palace on the moon in the year 1998 the dark powered enhanced Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa return home. Fueled by the dark energy of Thrax's anger and the knowledge of their future fate to become good should Zordon die the two tear the palace apart. Rita says that they should have Goldar clean up the mess, but after Zedd informs Rita that Goldar never came back home, the two decide that they can make a new and better Goldar with their enhanced powers. Rita and Zedd then begin to plot their path to victory.\n----\nNotes: 1.

After some brief and yet crude introductions that make Poisandra blush, the villains partake in some food. The villains then come under attack from Gem, the RPM Ranger Operator Series Gold. The previously unnamed dumbbell-themed Attack Bot from ''RPM'', now referring to himself as \"Dumbbot\", immediately beats Gem to death until he is a fine paste and Robogoat decides to wear the Ranger outfit. Impressed by the ability of \"Dumbbot\" to kill a Ranger, Poisandra forces Psycho Green to wear a tuxedo and marry her to \"Dumbbot\". Goldar then reveals that he is the one who sent out the invitations to all the villains. Goldar reveals to all the other villains that they weren't invited to join either \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" or the forces of Lord Drakkon in destroying the Power Rangers. Now Goldar wants the villains to prove that they are indeed strong enough to defeat the Power Rangers and they decide to film themselves at the gym destroying Putties dressed as Rangers. \"Dumbbot\" makes an offhand comment about Rita Repulsa that gets him struck by a bolt of lightning. A short time later \"Dumbbot\" has his arms randomly fall off. Poisandra decides to keep one of the arms and his other arm is reattached backward and severely melted. Waspicable decides to show everyone how evil she is by growing big and smacking all the villains to various locations throughout space, time and other dimensions. Goldar tells Waspicable that none of it was recorded. Robogoat goes swimming on Aquatar and Psycho Green ends up in the Dark Dimension. Poisandra runs into Thrax, who is looking for his parents in Angel Grove in 1994 and she bludgeons him to death with the arm from \"Dumbbot\". \"Dumbbot\" is on a planet of gold in the Lion's Head Galaxy. The Alien Rangers of Aquatar throw Robogoat back to the moon and his muscles are now ripped from the swimming. Psycho Green returns to the moon and randomly brings back \"Dumbbot\", Poisandra and Grace Sterling, the Mighty Morphin Red Ranger from 1969. Several of the villains decide to show off to Grace Sterling by playing basketball. Grace Sterling ends up up-showing and injuring Robogoat. Waspicable spins the basketball on her stinger and \"Dumbbot\" ends up hitting himself upside the head with the ball. [[Breaking the fourth wall|Mike Ginn]] randomly appears in the gym with dumbbells for arms and is decapitated by Poisandra. \"Dumbbot\" blocks Grace Sterling's attack and she seems to disintegrate after Psycho Green attacks her. \"Dumbbot\" claim's Mike Ginn's head as a trophy but fails to record another Ranger being destroyed. General Venjix and the Venjix virus show up and both are attacked by \"Dumbbot\" and Robogoat. \"Dumbbot\" use Mike Ginn's head to attack General Venjix as Dr. Tommy Oliver appears in the arena. As Dr. Oliver attempts to morph into Dino Thunder Black Ranger he is stopped in mid-morph after being suplexed from the pocket dimension by Robogoat. \"Dumbbot\" decides to teabag Dr. Oliver as he lays on the floor partially morphed and is punched in the nards by Dr. Oliver. Sledge appears and teams up with Psycho Green. To avoid Poisandra Sledge challenges all the villains to a dance battle. Robogoat reaches into the pocket dimension and uses the Dragon Dagger to summon Dragonzord to throw Dr. Oliver into orbit while joining in on the dance off. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson appears to join the dance off and Goldar beheads him. Ziggy, the RPM Ranger Operator Series Green then appears and joins the dance. \"Dumbbot\" beats up Ziggy and Poisandra throws Ziggy and Sledge together as she calls down Sledge's Ship and releases all the bounty monsters on board the ship. Goldar's armor starts to fall off revealing that he is really Zac Eubank in disguise. Robogoat decides to rummage through all of Dr. Oliver's closets in the Dragonzord and finds each of his Ranger costumes along with the \"[[Dear John letter|Dear John]]\" letter Kimberly gave him. Robogoat then destroys all the bounty monsters from Sledge's ship with Dragonzord's missiles. \"Dumbbot\" beats Ziggy to death as Koda, the Dino Charge Blue Ranger appears. Koda tries to eat a shrunk Waspicable and spits the monster to the ground. Poisandra steals Koda's Energem. Robogoat has Dragonzord throw Koda against the wall killing him. Zac Eubank tries to keep the villains from also killing him by telling them he was recording them to give the villains better press. So Waspicable shoots Dragonzord and it falls onto Sledge's ship killing Rito Revolto, General Venjix and the Venjix virus. \"Dumbbot\" tries to grow and instead swells up and falls over teabagging Zac Eubank to death. Poisandra attacks a grown Psycho Green with the Energem enhanced arm of \"Dumbbot\" as Robogoat appeals to Waspicable with some balloons. Vesper, the Hyperforce Black Ranger then appears and attacks Robogoat for trying to say he is Doggie Cruger because she believes that Cruger is a jerk. Vesper then uses the Energem from Poisandra to become a half Blue and Black Ranger and comments on it being like being merged with Eddie, the Hyperforce Blue Ranger. \"Dumbbot\" has his muscles explode and is reduced to a weakling. Vesper rips off Robogoat's arm and beats him with it. Robogoat tries to pull Alpha 5 from the pocket dimension, but fails and is forced to slap Vesper. Robogoat tries to hide by dressing up in the Goldar armor that was left behind. Psycho Green smashes Robogoat until Robogoat and the Goldar armor fuse together. Poisandra runs off to hide in Lord Zedd's palace. Robogoat prays to a goat god to grows a new arm. Robogoat then flies away with the Goldar wings to go get a chocolate shake and joins the police to become [[RoboCop|RobogoatCop]]. Rita Repulsa goes to the arena to yell at the deceased Zac for all the damage to the arena. \"Dumbbot\" tries to convince Vesper to leave him alone, but Mike Ginn's head reveals that \"Dumbbot\" is a villain. Vesper injures \"Dumbbot\" as Eye Guy randomly appears. Vesper blows a bunch of dust into Eye Guy's eyes and Waspicable makes it worse trying to clean the dust away. Eye Guy sprouts some wings and flies away to join the hamburger franchise [[Five Guys]] so that the place can be now known as Five Eye Guys. Vesper shrinks and Rita Repulsa randomly blows up. Lord Zedd sends Psycho Green to pick up the food from Five Eye Guys for a commercial shoot. \"Dumbbot\" steps on Vesper, killing her. \"Dumbbot\" then restores Mike Ginn back to life and they revive Zac Eubank back to life for the sole purpose of killing him again. The Wizard of Deception turns the arena into a curvy road covered in rain as Lord Zedd takes the food. Chloe Ashford, the Hyperforce Pink Ranger appears with a burrito and has a conversation with Waspicable. Louie Kaboom randomly appears from a portal and stands over in a corner as Chloe and the villains decide they want to act in the commercial. Poisandra has taken over Lord Zedd's palace on the moon as no one remains in the palace to challenge her as the ruler of the moon. Mike Ginn follows the Wizard of Deception's advice and falls into a portal that causes him to drift off lifelessly into space. Louie Kaboom explodes killing everyone in the arena except for the Wizard of Deception who floats away with an SD card. The Wizard of Deception takes the SD card to Eye Five Guys and watches the footage as Eye Guy gives the Wizard of Deception a gift card.\n----\nNotes: 1. Zac Eubank once again reprises his role as a guest [[gamemaster|Game Master]] due to Malika Lim once again taking on a guest player role during this special episode.\n\n2. This special is a bonus episode made beyond the original 25 episodes that were scheduled. The special episode aired on a special day as part of Hyper RPG's HyperDrive; a monthly day long fundraiser event designed to help raise funds for the company's daily expenses. Due to this the episode isn't labelled under the ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' show title as the rest of the season. Also due to being part of the HyperDrive, after the live airing the special remained a [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] exclusive that can only be re-watched if caught during rerun while Hyper RPG isn't airing live or through a paid subscription to Hyper RPG's channel. Since the special won't be uploaded to [[YouTube]] like the normal episodes it doesn't have an episode title in the same way as the rest of the ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' episodes do. As such, the episode title listed for this special comes from what the special was listed as on Hyper RPG's HyperDrive schedule when it originally aired live.\n\n3. Unlike the main episodes for ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'', this special featured a slightly different [[Tabletop role-playing game|Tabletop RPG]] system and interactive Twitch participation component during the live-stream that favored more spontaneity. The special was also less reliant on planned scenarios to guide the special's narrative unlike the main episodes. As such, the story and [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] was much more chaotic and random, similar to what one might expect from an [[improvisational comedy]] or [[sketch comedy]] show like ''[[Kwik Witz]]'' or ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''. Due to these factors, this special is considered to be in its own continuity separate of ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'', the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' TV show multiverse and the ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' comics multiverse despite drawing inspiration from all three sources. Although not considered in continuity with anything else in the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, the special is still none the less considered a canon product to ''[[Power Rangers]]'' in the sense that Saban Brands approved of the special being made.\n\n4. Because this special episode focuses mostly on the perspective of the random villains and monsters of the day, the cast of this special is entirely guest players. The new guest players are Cameron Rice, Melissa Flores and Jason Bischoff. Cameron Rice is a Writer for ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' and Hyper RPG. Melissa Flores is the Director for ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' and ''Power Rangers'' Content for Saban Brands. Jason Bischoff is the Director of Global Consumer Products for ''Power Rangers'' and Saban Brands. The returning guest players, Mike Ginn and Malika Lim, are playing new characters from their previous guest player appearances.\n\n5. This special was made before it was officially established in ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' that Thrax and \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" were one in the same.

Often these shows will feature a game master and four to five players, with an occasional guest depending on the game. Many of their shows feature heavy viewer participation where participants can donate to the channel to earn the players a power-up or extra roll. Larger donations may initiate plot twists in the story, causing further drama to unfold. Each episode regardless of game will often run between 2 and 3 hours, with a short intermission somewhere in the middle of the broadcast.\n\nReviews - Review shows covering television shows, movies, books and general pop culture and often with a rotating panel of guests and regular members.Typically these will air when a notable pop-culture event is released.\n\nTalk Shows - General forum for news, pop talk and the opinions of the guests and hosts. Many of their talk shows air daily, often before or after a related show, with the Coffee & Comics airing on Wednesdays.\n\nPodcast - ''Hyper Heroes'' is a podcast form of some of the non-role-playing game shows. The Podcast has been active since August 1, 2017<ref>{{Citation|title=Is Batfleck leaving the DCEU?! \u2014 Hyper Heroes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRNL0XkHEXw&list=PLHKocVDXoWBt0sPht2wq48hcGpv4g3HZH&index=104|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nWeekly Update - Every Monday a member of the team will break down the schedule for the week and share channel news.\n\n=== Kollok 1991 ===\nRecent show ''Kollok 1991'' is inspired by such shows as ''Stranger Things'', ''X-Files'', and ''Twin Peaks''.

Professor Jen Scotts distracts the attackers from her cadets while four of her cadets (Marv, Vesper, Chloe, Eddie) and Time Force [[Beat (police)|beat]] officer Jack struggle to keep themselves safe.They discover that the officers who betrayed Time Force are part of \"The Alliance\", who state that their numbers are infinite and evil is their goal. A mysterious shadowed figure appears to be \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" and battles against the Pink Time Force Ranger. The cadets attempt to save Professor Scotts but are unable to stop the shadowed figure from escaping in a time ship and traveling through time. Professor Scotts indicates that she has lost contact with her Ranger team and that the cadets, along with officer Jack, need to follow the shadowed figure through time while she stays in 3016 to gather information. The cadets reluctantly leave the Pink Time Force Ranger behind and activate a time ship along with robotic assistant Alpha 55, who informs them that the shadowed figure has traveled back to a city called Angel Grove in the year 1994. Alpha 55 then assists the cadets in opening a case that Professor Scotts gave them and inside they find prototype morphers.\n }}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = It's Morphin Time!\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|10|31}}\n | ShortSummary= The Time Force cadets and officer Jack struggle to acclimate to the many aspects of their newly recruited roles as Hyperforce Rangers. After getting better acquainted with their time ship the Rangers arrive at Angel Grove on Halloween night in the year 1994. They begin their search to apprehend \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" while attempting to better understand both the holiday and general culture of that time period. Eventually, the Rangers discover the shadowed figure's time ship at the park, but not before coming into confrontation with the Putty Patrollers and the Candius Cornicus monster; forcing them to morph for the first time. The Rangers struggle to come together as a team but eventually succeed in defeating the Putties and monster. \"The Leader\" however proves to be too much for the Rangers. In a weakened state, a reckless Marv has to be stopped by Eddie before he is destroyed. Jack attempts to take on \"The Leader\" himself to give the rest of his team a chance to regroup but is severely injured in the process. The Rangers are forced to retreat to get Jack desperate medical attention for his injuries.\n }}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = Whatever Happened to Scorpina?\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|07}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers find themselves in a difficult situation trying to save Jack's life while their time ship comes under attack from \"The Leader\" who is in close pursuit. They manage to save Jack and drive off \"The Leader\" with the help of the Vortex Cannon, but not before the time ship is heavily damaged in the attack stranding the Hyperforce Rangers in 1994. Vesper and Eddie attempt to make repairs while the other Rangers experiment with the time ship's battle simulator and food replicator systems with unusual results. Eddie becomes resentful of Chloe as she grows to be close friends with Marv. Meanwhile, Vesper fashions the Hyperforce Rangers' power weapons from parts salvaged off of the time ship and Alpha 55 while developing closer feelings towards Eddie; whom she gives a present. Jack tries to discern what \"The Leader\" is plotting when the time ship receives a warning that the timeline is being altered as a villain known as Scorpina will disappear from 1994. The Hyperforce Rangers confront a disguised Scorpina at the library where Eddie is compromised by Scorpina's influence. They manage to snap Eddie out of the spell but then come under attack from Velchanos and his monsters created from the library's books and other surroundings. The Rangers destroy the book monsters, but Scorpina and Velchanos manage to escape. The Hyperforce Rangers later return to the Library in civilian form to help clean up the damage while discussing what to do next to complete their mission before the timeline is further compromised by the return of the Rangers of 1994 from outer space. Marv comes to the realization that he may not have been a good friend towards Eddie following the incident with Scorpina and privately begins to open up to him about his troubled past in Time Force and with Jack.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Aisha Campbell Returns!\n |Aux1 = [[Karan Ashley]] as Aisha Campbell, the 2nd [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Mighty Morphin]] Yellow Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|14}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers finish cleaning up the library as they ponder how to stop Scorpina and Velchanos from stealing Finster's clay when they are suddenly contacted by Zordon, who had been monitoring the situation from a distance since detecting their time ship's arrival on Halloween. Zordon recalls Aisha from the Mighty Morphin Rangers' space mission and enlists her on a secret mission to help the Hyperforce Rangers' in their task to repair the timeline. Chloe and Vesper return to the library and awkwardly use their stealth to slip past the police to borrow some of the damaged books hoping to use the residual energy signature to track Scorpina and Velchanos. As Alpha 55 sets up the means of tracking the signature Aisha attempts to assess the Hyperforce Rangers' abilities within the battle simulator much to Jack's chagrin at Chloe's program choices. The six Rangers then travel together within the Sabretooth Tiger Griffin Thunderzord to Italy to find a depressed Finster who is feeling outcast and obsolete since Lord Zedd's arrival. The Hyperforce Rangers attempt to befriend Finster before Velchanos and Scorpina arrive, but then come under attack on two sides by Finster's Bully Putty and Velchanos's lady, fighter, and senator statue monsters. The Rangers destroy the monsters, but Velchanos is successful in stealing Finster's clay. Velchanos uses a tiny piece of clay to create the Gladiator statue monster and calls upon the dark powers of \"The Leader\" to make the monster grow to cover his and Scorpina's escape. The Hyperforce Rangers combine their powers with the Thunderzord to destroy the Gladiator, but not before some historical monuments were damaged in the attack. The Hyperforce Rangers return to Angel Grove and say their goodbyes to Aisha as Zordon recalls her back to continue her space mission with the Mighty Morphin Rangers.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = We Need Megazord Power!\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|21}}\n | ShortSummary= Alpha 55 improves upon the time ship's scanners and discovers that only three hours remain before Scorpina's disappearance from time becomes permanent. The Hyperforce Rangers continue their repairs to the time ship in hopes of tracking down Scorpina and stopping the change, but realize they don't have the necessary parts for repairs. Vesper and Eddie then attempt an alternate plan of contacting Time Force in the year 3016 instead for assistance. Zordon contacts the Hyperforce Rangers once again noting that Lord Zedd has taken advantage of the situation with the Mighty Morphin Rangers being away from the planet. As Vesper and Eddie continue to contact the future Marv, Chloe, and Jack come to Zordon's aid of evacuating civilians and confronting the dog samurai monster known as Shibarai. Lord Zedd observes the battle from his palace on the moon and sends in reinforcements with the Z-Putties. Scorpina, Velchanos and \"The Leader\" also observe the battle from their time ship but choose not to interfere as they prepare for the next phase of their plans. The Hyperforce Rangers defeat the Z-Putties and Shibari, but Zedd then makes the monster grow. Vesper and Eddie succeed in contacting Time Force and are sent the newly created Hyper Zords along with supplies for repairing their time ship. The Shibarai monster is destroyed by the Hyper Zords and the Hyperforce Rangers combine the Hyper Zords with their time ship to follow \"The Leader\" and his time ship as they slip away in a time stream outside of normal time and space. The Hyperforce Rangers' time ship is then compromised by turbulence from the other time ship along with an unknown system failure to the electronics. Alpha 55  also becomes compromised to a similar system failure as the time ship crash lands. The Hyperforce Rangers then come into contact with a person calling herself M and agree to help her and the other refugees make their way to Corinth.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Vesper's Betrayal\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|11|28}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers continue their trip with the refugees to make their way to Corinth. On the way there they learn more from M about the Venjix computer virus that has infected their time ship and Alpha 55's systems as well as the condition of the barren, radioactive and machine infested world they are left to traverse in. Marv, unaware that they are in a parallel reality from their own, blames himself for this apocalyptic outcome due to the Hyperforce Rangers inability to stop the alterations to the timeline. Vesper begins to question the meaning of her existence and asks Eddie out on a date after they complete their mission as Hyperforce Rangers. The Hyperforce Rangers and refugees arrive at the now abandoned ruins of Omega City and are forced to take shelter from an oncoming radioactive storm within the freezer of an old gelato store. While taking shelter they come under attack from the Grinders. The Hyperforce Rangers and M manage to fend off the robots, but the refugees are captured and dragged away. They follow the tracks left behind to a factory being commanded by the machine general known as Kilobyte. M takes cover as the Hyperforce Rangers ram their truck into the factory as a diversion. As the main Grinder force attacks Jack, Marv and Chloe, Vesper tries to take on Kilobyte while Eddie follows close behind. Kilobyte infects Vesper with the Venjix virus, revealing Vesper to be an android. Vesper, unable to control her actions, beats Eddie within an inch of his life. Marv and Chloe discover the refugees, but Chloe becomes horribly mortified when one her attacks on the Grinders goes awry and injures several of the refugees. Jack comes to Marv and Chloe's aid and explains that Eddie needs help from Vesper. Marv however distrusts Jack when Vesper radios Marv to say that Jack had attacked her and Eddie. Before Marv and Jack can sort out the issue Kilobyte springs a trap ensnaring the two along with Chloe and the refugees within a cage. A barely live Eddie is left alone to struggle against the infected Vesper.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = It's Boom Time\n |Aux1 = [[Mike Ginn]] as Gem, the [[Power Rangers RPM|RPM]] Ranger Operator Series Gold\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|12|12}}\n | ShortSummary= Venjix discusses with Kilobyte the unusual devices taken off of the captured Hyperforce Rangers and sends Shifter out to ascertain their origins as to acquire more of their technology. Meanwhile the captured Hyperforce Rangers are processed at a factory responsible for building Grinders where they meet another captor by the name of Gem. The Rangers attempt to appeal to Vesper's better nature, but to no avail much to Gem's amusement at the spectacle as he reveals to the Rangers that Vesper is a machine. As the Hyperforce Rangers discuss a plan for escape, Gem mentions that he already has a plan for escape using a device he cobbled together from the scraps of tech about the factory to disable the security. The Rangers decide to make a distraction for the escape by flipping some tables while working on the assembly lines, but things quickly go south after Gem gets a bit overzealous in table flipping and Vesper threatens to kill the badly injured Eddie. Marv quickly improvises a new distraction by intentionally gagging himself until he vomits on Vesper. With the Grinders distracted Gem and Chloe sneak off and destroy the factory's generator before elaborately flipping into the ducts leading to the research lab where medical supplies for Eddie and their Time Force devices are being held. Jack enters the lab shortly after and reacquires the Hyperforce team's morphers as well as the RPM Gold and Silver morphers for Gem. Gem quickly builds a new device allowing the Rangers to briefly enter Vesper's mind where they learn more of Vesper's past through her memories and eventually break Venjix's hold. Gem goes off to free more prisoners in a separate wing of the factory only to learn that his sister Gemma is no longer there. Before Gem and the Hyperforce Rangers can escape they come under attack from the Generation 13 Buzzsaw Attack Bot nicknamed Buzzkill. M arrives with reinforcements found near Omega City and comes to help rescue the prisoners as Venjix initiates the download to make Buzzkill grow. While the reinforcements deal with the ground forces Gem summons the RPM Falcon Zord and the Hyperforce Rangers summon the Hyperforce Zords to form the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord for the first time. With their combined powers Gem and the Hyperforce Rangers destroy Buzzkill and send Kilobyte hurdling into the distance thousands of miles away. Gem leaves to search for his sister Gemma. M and the refugees also leave to continue their trip to Corinth. Thinking Alpha 55 may have also been freed of Venjix's hold after saving Vesper, the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to contact him, but are unable to reach him. The Rangers return to the ship to find it and Alpha 55 slightly in disarray from when they were last there. Vesper, now knowing that she is an android, is able to connect herself directly to the time ship and return it to the time stream to pursue \"The Leader\" on his last known trajectory. As most of the Rangers head off to celebrate with some well earned burritos Marv reveals to Vesper in secret that he is an alien and that he can relate to her android situation as he knows what it feels like trying to fit in with others when you are different.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = Holiday Special Featuring Santa!\n |Aux1 = Zac Eubank as [[Santa Claus]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2017|12|19}}\n | ShortSummary= Some time has passed since the Hyperforce Rangers had resumed their mission in time. Eddie discusses with Marv and Chloe all that has happened since discovering Vesper was an android and wonders how she could keep something like that from him and the others. In the process of discussing Vesper overhears part of the conversation and states to Eddie and the others that even she was unaware until she was infected with the Venjix virus. In the same conversation Marv inadvertently outs himself as being an alien. Vesper and Chloe head off to work on repairing Alpha 55 and decide to test the full extent of Vesper's android abilities. Vesper lets Chloe know that she is intentionally avoiding Eddie partly out of guilt for hurting him and partly out of a need to focus on herself at the moment since the revelation of not being human. Chloe reveals to Vesper that she also isn't being fully honest with the other Rangers and has also been looking for her parents. Alpha 55 comes back online but before the Hyperforce Rangers can celebrate Alpha 55 warns them of an incoming magical power. Marv, Chloe, Eddie and Vesper are forcibly teleported off of the time ship to the North Pole on Christmas Eve in the year 1985, leaving Alpha 55 and Jack on board the time ship. They learn from the elf Squeezy Sparkle Toes that it was Santa who had teleported the Rangers as Christmas was being threatened by the monster [[Krampus]]. Santa explains that only the holiday spirit can truly defeat Krampus and the Hyperforce Rangers agree to help. To get into the holiday spirit the Rangers change into holiday-themed pajamas and Vesper finally gains the courage to talk to Eddie about how she is currently feeling. Eddie tells Vesper to take all the time she needs to figure things out and Vesper decides to take a chance and kisses Eddie on the cheek. Meanwhile Santa confronts Chloe and gives her some advice about being truthful with her friends, though Chloe still remains reluctant. Krampus attacks Santa's workshop with his foot soldiers created from coal known as the Naughties. Eddie fends off some of the Naughties, but Krampus manages to steal Santa's \"Naughty or Nice\" Christmas list. Santa suits up in elf created battlizer armor and he and the Hyperforce Rangers head out to retrieve back the list. Chloe and Squeezy do some reconnaissance in Krampus's hideout and cause a distraction. Santa and the Hyperforce Rangers take this opportunity to attack Krampus as he grows giant. Santa combines his battlizer with his sleigh to create a large Sleigh Zord and the Hyperforce Rangers summon their Hyperforce Zords. The Hyperforce Rangers injure Krampus and steal back the list as the constant singing causes the Naughties to be destroyed. Krampus is further weakened by the Hyperforce Ranger's holiday spirit as Santa uses the full force of his now damaged Sleigh Zord and then his own inner magical abilities to defeat Krampus in an explosive uppercut. After shrinking, Krampus retreats and the Hyperforce Rangers use their Hyperforce Zords to help Santa deliver the presents in time to save Christmas day. While celebrating the victory back at the North Pole the Rangers are contacted by Alpha 55 as the time ship appears in the sky. As the time ship lands and opens up the Hyperforce Rangers are greeted by Jack.\n----\nNote: Paul Schrier was absent from participating in this episode due to recovering from oral surgery.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |Title = Dr. Tommy Oliver Returns!\n |Aux1 = [[Jason David Frank]] as [[Tommy Oliver|Dr. Tommy Oliver]], the [[Power Rangers Dino Thunder|Dino Thunder]] Black Dino Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|02}}\n | ShortSummary= Jack exits the time ship along with Dr. Tommy Oliver to greet the other Hyperforce Rangers. Confused by Dr. Oliver's presence, the Hyperforce Rangers fill Jack in with their recent adventure with Santa and Jack in turn explains to the other Hyperforce Rangers that from his perspective the Hyperforce Rangers had been missing for several weeks and not just hours. In those weeks that the Hyperforce Rangers were missing Jack explains that he and Alpha 55 did an extensive search for them and were able to reprogram the time ship to detect time anomalies in the process. As a result, they were able to detect \"The Leader\" in Reefside in the year 2005 attempting to find Dr. Anton Mercer and revive his alter ego Mesogog. Jack explains that while in 2005 he met Dr. Oliver who in turn offered his expertise in finding the Hyperforce Rangers, eventually bringing the time ship to the North Pole in 1985. The Hyperforce Rangers and Dr. Oliver return to Reefside in the year 2005 to discover that Dr. Mercer is missing and Dr. Oliver's friend Haley is in the process of destroying his newly rebuilt underground headquarters, having prior been destroyed by Zeltrax. Eddie uses his focus ability to neutralize Hayley and they see a news broadcast where \"The Leader\" is demanding for Dr. Mercer and his alter ego Mesogog for his plans. The Hyperforce Rangers learn that Hayley's actions were the result of being exposed to a strange gas being emitted from Hayley's Cyber Cafe. The Hyperforce Rangers use their power to temporarily charge the Black Dino Gem so that Dr. Oliver can become the Black Dino Ranger once more and then they head to the Cyber Cafe. At the Cyber Cafe the Rangers discover the Putties and a horse plant hybrid Perfume Pony monster. The Hyperforce Rangers manage to drive off the people infected by the gas and discover that the Perfume Pony is the source of the gas. Eddie and Vesper are infected by the gas, but are brought back to their senses after taking blows to their heads. As the putties are defeated by Dr. Oliver and the other Hyperforce Rangers, Jack uses one of Dr. Oliver's borrowed gas masks to smother the Perfume Pony in its own gas causing the monster to grow. Alpha 55 works on an antidote to the gas and part of the Hyperforce team begins to cryonic-ally freeze the infected civilians attacking them. Dr. Oliver summons the Mezodon Megazord and the other Hyperforce Rangers follow him to suppress the Perfume Pony. Calling upon the Hyperforce Zords, the Perfume Pony is badly damaged. Dr. Oliver finishes the monster off with his Brachio Staff, sealing the monster underground. Using their combined powers the antidote is then dispersed around Reefside saving the civilians. Dr. Oliver receives a phone call from Dr. Mercer, who is at Mercer Industries. They head to Mercer Industries and discover a badly injured Mercer surrounded by Putties. The Putties are driven off and Mercer is healed by Dr. Oliver using the Hyperforce Rangers' healing charge technology. Mercer begins changing into Mesogog, brought back to life due to residual Dino DNA still in Mercer's system. The Hyperforce Rangers learn from Mercer and the partially revived Mesogog that they refused to help \"The Leader\" in his plan of conquest, a plan that is revealed to be somehow tied to Zordon. Alpha 55 detects a disturbance on the other side of Reefside and the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to use the gas antidote to help Mercer rid himself of Mesogog, but with little success. Dr. Oliver decides to stay behind to help Mercer in preventing Mesogog from fully reviving as the Hyperforce Rangers say their goodbyes and head off to check out the disturbance.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |Title = Family\n |Aux1 = N/A\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|09}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at the disturbance on the other side of Reefside and discover the stolen time ship. Scorpina confronts the Hyperforce Rangers as the stolen time ship slips away into a time stream. After a brief battle, Scorpina is knocked unconscious and the Hyperforce Rangers decide to take her prisoner aboard their time ship as they jump into a time stream to follow after the stolen time ship. Failing to learn any new information from Scorpina, Eddie forms his own hypothesis based on Mercer and Mesogog's information that \"The Leader\" may be trying to prevent Zordon's death and the subsequent energy wave that resulted from it from destroying most of the United Alliance of Evil back in 1998. Using an unknown electrical power, Scorpina breaks free of her imprisonment and severely cripples the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship's systems. The Hyperforce Rangers split up to search the ship for Scorpina with part of the team heading to engineering and the other part heading to the living quarters. The Rangers are then visited by various demonic visions based on their past lives and dreams for the future. Jack sees his deceased robot dog. Marv is visited by his missing brother Joe and Eddie sees his childhood sweetheart and now ex-fiancee Bianca. Vesper sees a vision of a cool Eddie and Chloe must come to terms with the appearance of her deceased mother. The Hyperforce Rangers come to the conclusion that the visions are tied in some way to Scorpina using information from the police notes that Jack made with Alpha 55 when he was searching for the other Rangers. Uncertain what is real and what is fake they decide to disclose information about their pasts with each other to prove that they are indeed the real Rangers and not just illusions. Marv discloses how he faked being a Time Force officer in order to find his missing brother and was subsequently turned in by Jack. Chloe speaks of her deceased parents and explains that she steals things for those who are less fortunate. It is revealed that the Alpha 55 in the medical bay is fake and the real Alpha 55 uses a chest cannon to blow the fake Alpha 55 through the side of the time ship leaving a gaping hole. The fake Alpha 55, Scorpina, and demonic visions are all revealed to actually be the shape-shifting monster Primator. After a brief battle, the Primator grows and the Rangers call upon the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord's Phoenix formation. Primator proves too strong and rips off the Megazord's arms. The Rangers leave their cockpits and attempt to use their cannons to defeat the monster, but Primator avoids the damage and further trashes the Hyperforce Zords before shrinking back to normal size. Using the subterfuge of rocks, trees, Bianca and chipmunks to manipulate the Rangers, Primator separates and overcomes Marv. Using Mesogog's invisi-portal technology stolen from Mercer Industries, Primator kidnaps Marv and escapes to rejoin \"The Leader\" aboard the stolen time ship. Uncertain of where they are, the remaining Hyperforce Rangers are left stranded with their time ship in need of desperate repair. The Hyperforce Rangers are then confronted by knights on horseback who accuse them of witchcraft after seeing Alpha 55 cloak himself and the damaged time ship out of fear. Alpha 55 contacts the Hyperforce Rangers to let them know that the ship's sensors indicate that they are stranded in the 6th century.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |Title = A Ranger in King Arthur's Court\n |Aux1 = [[Allie Gonino]] as [[Guinevere|Lady Guinevere]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|16}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers are led by the knights to their castle of [[Camelot]] where they meet Lady Guinevere and [[Merlin]]. The knights identify themselves as the knights of the [[Round Table]]: Sir [[Lancelot]], Sir [[Galahad]], and Eddie's ancestor Sir Edward Banks II. The Hyperforce Rangers explain to Guinevere how the \"magic\" of their time ship had caused them to end up their kingdom, how their team leader Marv was kidnapped, and how they are now stranded due to the damage that the time ship had endured. Guinevere and Merlin agree to have their finest blacksmiths help the Hyperforce Rangers in repairing their time ship in exchange for the Rangers' own help in finding Camelot's missing leader, [[King Arthur]], and destroying the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] that is believed to be responsible for both his disappearance and the mass devastation throughout the kingdom. The Hyperforce Rangers agree to help and then excuse themselves to freshen up for dinner before discussing a plan with Guinevere and Merlin in accomplishing their goals. Vesper decides at this time to pretend to be a man while Chloe decides to introduce Guinevere to invention of world's first burrito. The castle comes under attack from the red dragon, but Guinevere manages to chase it away with an arrow attack to the dragon's eye. Eddie, uncertain of his fate in the future after having met his ancestor, decides to give Sir Edward love advice to help ensure that someday he'll still be born. As the Rangers retire for the night, Jack learns more from Lancelot about Arthur's disappearance, the magic crystals that Guinevere and the knights received from Merlin, and the deaths of the knights [[Percival]] and [[Tristan]]. The next day the Hyperforce Rangers, Guinevere and the knights set off for the cave of the dragon. Eddie becomes concerned that Sir Edward is also coming along, knowing that if Sir Edward were to die it would also mean an end to his existence. While trying to find their bearings in the dark woods they confront a [[werewolf]] that attacks Guinevere's pet dragon. The Hyperforce Rangers injure the werewolf; reverting the creature back into a villager that they then send off back to the castle on horseback for medical attention. After leaving the woods they are attacked near an ocean-side cliff first by [[harpy|harpies]] and then by [[siren (mythology)|sirens]]. Guinevere and the knights use their gems to morph into more powerful Ranger-like knight forms. Chloe also morphs and drives off the harpies with her whirlwind attack, but Sir Edward falls from the cliff. Eddie, Guinevere, and Chloe each try to save Sir Edward, but the allure of the sirens' song proves too powerful to overcome in a direct confrontation. Guinevere and the Hyperforce Rangers instead use a song of their own to drive off the sirens. Finally arriving at the abandoned village and cave of the red dragon the Hyperforce, Guinevere, and knights confront the red dragon in battle. After several attacks and massive damage, Eddie and Sir Edward use the combined power of their water attacks within the dragon's mouth and cause the dragon to implode on itself in a massive fireball. Jack then launches the fireball down a well extinguishing it. It is revealed that the red dragon was in fact King Arthur all along, having been cursed by [[Morgan le Fay]]. The Hyperforce Rangers use their healing charge technology to heal Arthur. As thanks for their help Guinevere and Arthur reward the Hyperforce Rangers with a pink magic crystal similar to the ones that the knights used. Saying their goodbyes to Guinevere, Arthur, Sir Edward and the rest of the knights; Alpha 55 has the Hyperforce Rangers teleport back to the now repaired time ship. The Hyperforce Rangers then send a message back to the Time Force Academy in the year 3017 to apprise them of the situation in hopes that Professor Scotts may have a means of finding and saving Marv.\n----\nNote: Peter Sudarso was absent from participating in this episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 12\n |Title = Save Marv\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|01|23}}\n | ShortSummary= Its been three days since the Hyperforce Rangers sent their message to Time Force and Jen Scotts in the year 3017. Getting desperate for a sign of Marv's location Vesper attempts a seance with the rest of the Hyperforce Rangers and Alpha 55. Unexpectedly it works to a degree and they make a brief connection to Marv and Alpha 55 gets a lock on the stolen time ship travelling within the normal time stream. The Hyperforce Rangers then receive a reply back from Jen Scotts who informs them that she can not assist them at this time due to dealing with \"The Alliance\" still present in the year 3017, but that she was going to send back an agent to help assist them. Not knowing who this agent was or when they would arrive the Hyperforce Rangers decide to drop from the hyper stream to the normal time stream to pursue the stolen time ship and begin to experience a similar turbulence to the last time they attempted to follow the stolen time ship so closely. Meanwhile aboard the stolen time ship \"The Leader\" continues his relentless torture and interrogation of Marv trying to ascertain how the Hyperforce Rangers are tracking his stolen ship so easily, yet he is not able to track the Hyperforce's ship. Marv attempts to buy time and feed misinformation to \"The Leader\" stating that they planted a tracker aboard the stolen ship. Finding Marv useless, \"The Leader\" decides that Alpha 55 must be the key and sends the Primator monster through an invisi-portal back to the Hyperforce's ship to kidnap Alpha. Primator disguises itself as Marv, but the Hyperforce Rangers aren't buying it. Eddie, remembering from what he read in the archives of when the Mighty Morphin Rangers faced Primator, decides to use a mirrored piece of the ship to reveal the Primator's identity. Unfazed, the Primator uses the image of Jack's robot dog and Chloe's deceased mom to escape and further mess with the Hyperforce Rangers while searching the ship for Alpha 55. Back aboard the stolen time ship, Marv is freed from his cell by a mysterious Time Force Silver Ranger with the ability to cloak himself invisible. The Silver Ranger reveals himself to be Joe, Marv's brother. Marv, under duress from several days of sleep deprivation and mental torture by \"The Leader\" and Primator, refuses to believe Joe; thinking that he is the Primator further trying to mess with his head. After some convincing, Marv eventually leaves the cell with alarms sounding, causing Putties to head toward the cell room. Joe claims that in order to get off the ship they need to destroy the main command room and Marv taps into one of the stolen ship's computers to bring up map schematics of the ship. Marv destroys a large group of Putties but is then confronted by Velchanos and a group of newly created Putties. Joe distracts Velchanos and the Putties as Marv sneaks away into the main command room being operated by Scorpina. Back on the Hyperforce's ship, Vesper tries to ram the stolen time ship in order to get it to drop its shields to teleport Marv, but with no success. Eddie attempts to follow Jack's advice of locking Primator in the pocket dimension, but finds himself locked inside instead. Vesper and Chloe then attempt to lure the Primator to the airlock to eject him out into the time stream. Not falling for the trick, Primator grabs Alpha and tries to make an escape through an invisi-portal. Chloe shoots the Primator in the back while disguised as her mother; then Jack throws himself in the way, freeing Alpha. Vesper in turn frees Jack with an attack and opens the airlock. Chloe uses the power of the pink gem she received from Guinevere to summon a Knight-like Battlizer form and blasts Primator out of the airlock, seemingly destroying the monster. Back aboard the stolen time ship, Marv sneaks into the engineering section and begins to smash the electronics, disabling the shields. Alpha detects two Ranger signatures and locks on to Marv, teleporting him away just before Scorpina and \"The Leader\" can destroy him. Marv informs the other Hyperforce Rangers that while he can't say for certainty, he  was saved by a Time Force Silver Ranger that may be his lost brother Joe. Joe then teleports to the Hyperforce's time ship. The Hyperforce Rangers try to get answers but are further confused when Joe refuses to fill them in as to why he was missing or what he is currently doing. Joe says his goodbyes and then teleports away. The Hyperforce Rangers then briefly discuss what Marv saw aboard the stolen ship, why \"The Leader\" thinks Alpha 55 may be important, why \"The Leader\" is unable to track the Hyperforce time ship, how the Hyperforce Rangers were able to connect to Marv briefly through their bond to the Morphin Grid and the possibility of tracking Joe through that same connection. The Hyperforce Rangers then decide to jump back into the hyper stream in order to repair their damaged ship and regroup before the stolen time ship has a chance to retaliate.\n----\nNotes: 1.

Jack and Eddie then confide in each other more about their past, from Jack's parents losing their lives in a war when Jack was young to Eddie having difficulties with stepping out of the shadow of his family's legacy. Meanwhile, Chloe, suffering from junk food withdrawal, searches the ship for Vesper desperately in the hope that the kitchen can be repaired. Alpha 55 hears Chloe crying for Vesper and tries to calm her down while trying to cover for Vesper's disappearance by telling Chloe that Vesper is napping. Chloe then goes off to find Marv, who is currently in the simulator repeatedly reliving his nightmare on board the stolen time ship as a prisoner. Concerned for Marv, Chloe has a talk with him about his brother's secret mission. Marv tells Chloe he feels like he is unworthy to be the leader of the Hyperforce Rangers. Chloe, in turn, confesses that she feels similar with her role as a Ranger and that the only reason she joined Time Force was to find answers about her own parents' disappearance, even if it meant stealing the information from Time Force itself. Alpha 55 joins them in the simulator and surprises Chloe with a repaired food replicator, but needs Chloe's help in entering the recipes. Chloe takes this time to also have Alpha 55 contact Time Force with her concern for Marv and his brother's secret mission. A short time later, the Hyperforce Rangers discuss \"The Alliance\" intentions some more but with little progress when Alpha 55 picks up a time anomaly in the town of [[Power Rangers Mystic Force|Briarwood]] in the year 2005. Not wanting to be a step behind yet again, Jack asks Alpha 55 if its possible to teleport there a day early to stop \"The Alliance\" to which Alpha 55 complies. While in Briarwood, the Hyperforce Rangers track an energy signature to a candy store before hearing the sirens of several fire trucks. The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at a burning apartment building and spring into action to save any lives inside. Alpha 55 then detects the time anomaly occurring ahead of schedule and teleports the Hyperforce Rangers to the site where they meet the Mystic Mother in her Mystic Palace. Mystic Mother confesses that she had sensed the Hyperforce Rangers and had actually been the one to summon them there. Mystic Mother learns from the Hyperforce Rangers about the plan to revive Zordon and tells them about her past as Rita Repulsa and that Zordon's revival must be stopped at all cost to maintain the future. Mystic Mother then helps Chloe, Marv, Eddie and Jack confront their insecurities to unlock their full potential with upgraded weapons for the entire team, before teleporting the Rangers back to their time ship. Back aboard the time ship, Chloe receives a reply back from Time Force with declassified files on Marv's brother and his secret mission. The Hyperforce Rangers decide to follow up on the secret mission lead and set the time ship for the year 2025.\n----\nNotes: 1.

Vesper wakes from her nap and attempts another seance to make a connection to Joe, but Alpha 55 has a better plan and takes a DNA sample from Marv and uses that sample in conjunction with the ship's sensors to track people with a similar DNA signature. Alpha 55 manages to make a connection with Joe, but the signature is weak enough that there is a half hour lag. The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at the apartment of Adonis Washington and are confronted by Detective Lina Song of S.P.D.'s D-Squad when a proton accelerator is mysteriously stolen. The Hyperforce Rangers attempt to remain incognito by passing themselves off as \"H-Squad\" from planet Kaien's S.P.D. division. Detective Song and the Hyperforce Rangers track the proton accelerator's signature to the Oak's Furniture Company where they are confronted by a furniture pirate themed mutant known as Captain Pegs and his monstrous pet macaw known as Birdie. After a brief skirmish with both monsters, Chloe uses the Gem to enter her Pink Battle Warrior form and exposes the monsters' mutant DNA with a blast, making them grow. The Hyperforce Rangers combine their recently upgraded weapons from Mystic Mother to form the Hyper Vortex Cannon and destroy Birdie. Captain Pegs retaliates, but Eddie makes quick work of the monster by making its wooden body swell with water till exploding. Detective Song then takes the Hyperforce Rangers to meet with Commander Anubis \"Doggie\" Cruger for debriefing. Cruger is suspicious of the Hyperforce Rangers' cover story of being \"H-Squad\", but he does believe them enough to let them tag along and look for their undercover officer as S.P.D. tracks down the stolen proton accelerator while the A-Squad Rangers are off-world and B-Squad is still in training to become Rangers. With Detective Song's surveillance equipment the Hyperforce Rangers go undercover to follow a lead on Captain Peg's employer, a frog mutant known as Napoleon Wrench, that takes them to a seedy hideout for misfit teens. While there, Eddie is mistaken for his ancestor from 2025, Johnny Banks. Napoleon Wrench calls a meeting with all the misfit teens and reveals that their plans will soon come to fruition now that he is in possession of the proton accelerator thanks to Maxwell. Napoleon then names Maxwell as his personal guard as Maxwell is revealed from a distance to the Hyperforce Rangers to be Joe Shih in disguise.\n----\nNotes: 1.

Joe recognizes Vesper in the crowd and attempts to maintain his cover as \"Maxwell\" by dispatching one of the teens, the lobster armed mutant Jackson, to deal with her stating that she may be dangerous. Napoleon is alerted by Jackson to the detection of someone or something from the future. Joe tells Napoleon that he will deal with the problem, but not wanting to risk losing the proton accelerator for their beacon to initiate the \"Absorption\", Napoleon instead chooses to have himself and Joe retreat to another room in the building while alerting the mutant teens to deal with the threat. Jack tries to create a diversion and lure some of the mutant teens away by saying there is free ice cream, but only succeeds in distracting Chloe instead. Jack resigns himself to pretending to be a mutant using a boot. Under Marv's advisement, Chloe then decides to \"Power Streak\" by stripping off Detective Song's coat and damaging it in process, much to Song's dismay, before running away from the crowd of mutants. Vesper uses her hologram ability to look like a lizard mutant and distracts even more mutants into looking for a lost purse and dog. Joe convinces Napoleon to let him go back and deal with the problem and uses the opportunity to go invisible to tamper with the proton accelerator. Marv goes to help Vesper escape the mutants while Eddie comes to Chloe's aid and destroys an incoming barrel, hurting Chloe in the process. Eddie and Chloe then combine their powers to create a wall of water to wash many of the mutant teens away. With Joe taking too long to reply back, Napoleon checks on the proton accelerator and catches \"Maxwell\" in the process of tampering with it. Napoleon reprimands Joe physically, but Joe manages to barely talk himself out of the situation as the two retreat from the hideout with the proton accelerator to the barge. Detective Song takes the Hyperforce Rangers back to S.P.D.'s headquarters for severely botching the mission to retrieve the proton accelerator. Cruger and Song separate the Hyperforce Rangers into different cells and begin to interrogate them more severely after Cruger learns from S.P.D.'s main command that there is no \"H-Squad\" or S.P.D. division on the planet Kaien. While being interrogated, each Hyperforce Ranger takes a different tactic to dealing with Cruger and Song. Chloe refuses commands to power down and acts overall aloof. Vesper cracks dog jokes, howls from her cell, and morphs; forgetting that S.P.D. was already aware that she could. Eddie is unable to take the pressure, freaking out completely. He cracks, spilling his guts within only a literal matter of seconds, but Cruger and Song are unable to fully comprehend due to the speed at which he had said it. Cruger tries to confirm Eddie's story with Jack, who will only recite his rank and serial number. Cruger then tries again with Marv who becomes the most confrontational of the five. Back at the barge, Joe continues to tamper with the proton accelerator while hooking it up to the beacon. Joe attempts to warn one of the more trustful teens, the turtle legged mutant Carl, to leave before it is too late. Napoleon overhears Joe and notices that he is tampering with the proton accelerator yet again. Enraged, Napoleon decides that \"Maxwell\" can't be trusted and attempts to have him eliminated. Joe blows his cover and reveals that he is with Time Force. Unable to defeat Napoleon in a head on head confrontation, Joe attempts to destroy the proton accelerator. The proton is accelerator is activated instead, badly injuring Joe and vaporizing Napoleon. The pulse makes S.P.D. aware that the beacon has been activated and the Hyperforce Rangers are released to deal with the problem; with Song giving the Hyperforce Rangers a \"one use\" healing charge replica. The stolen time ship lands and \"The Leader\" appears. The proton accelerator is removed from the beacon and given to Velchanos to repair the stolen time ship. Scorpina relays to \"The Leader\" that the ship is being repaired, but the reboot sequence has initiated a security protocol requiring a Time Force signature. \"The Leader\" begins to absorb the life force energy of the mutant teens, but Joe interferes. The saved mutant teens try to flee as the Hyperforce Rangers arrive within their Hyper Zords. Eddie, with Chloe's help, uses S.P.D.'s \"one use\" healing charge replica to heal Joe making \"The Leader\" aware to their presence. Jack then damages \"The Leader\" with a barrage of missiles. \"The Leader\" tosses Joe while taking his morpher and, despite Vesper's efforts to protect the mutant teens, finishes to absorb their life force energy. \"The Leader\" then returns to the stolen time ship, activating it with the stolen morpher, and re-enters the time stream. The Hyperforce Rangers activate their own healing charge technology to revive Carl, but don't have enough energy to revive the other mutant teens. Detective Song contacts the Hyperforce Rangers to say that S.P.D. will take care of the unconscious mutant teens. The Hyperforce Rangers then board their time ship as Alpha 55 sets the tracking signal to Joe's stolen morpher and enters the time stream to chase after the stolen time ship.\n----\nNote: Zac Eubank has a brief [[non-player character|NPC]] cameo appearance in this episode, reprising his role as Anubis \"Doggie\" Cruger, the leader of S.P.D.'s earth division and eventual [[Power Rangers S.P.D.|S.P.D.]] Shadow Ranger.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 16\n |Title = Homecoming\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|02|20}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers, with Joe recovering in the medical bay, follow the stolen time ship two years further into the future to the year 2027 where they arrive at an off-world S.P.D. correctional facility on the planet Y37. \"The Leader\" breaks into the facility and frees the S.P.D. A-Squad from their imprisonment for police corruption and treason against S.P.D. by aligning with the Troobian Empire. Jack suggests that it may be in the team's best interest to capture the A-Squad's Red Ranger, Charlie and interrogate her for information. Vesper however has another plan and builds a pair of bombs with the hope of destroying the facility against the other Hyperforce Ranger's better judgement. As A-Squad infiltrates the watchtower and harasses the guard, the Hyperforce Rangers discuss the best way to infiltrate the facility. Ignoring the conversation, Vesper throws caution to the wind and lets out the battle cry of \"[[Leeroy Jenkins]]\" as she jumps into action. The remaining Hyperforce Rangers immediately jump into action to aid Vesper, but Chloe misjudges her jump and ends up in the moat instead. Vesper threatens to blow up A-Squad with her bombs, forcing them to retreat. Eddie checks on the guard as Chloe uses her whirlwind attack with the water from the moat to slow down A-Squad from escaping. As the other Hyperforce Rangers catch up to Chloe, Vesper uses one of her bombs to injure A-Squad. The A-Squad Rangers attempt to retaliate, but are blinded by the smoke. Using the smoke cloud from the exploded bomb to their advantage, Eddie grabs hold of A-Squad Red and A-Squad Blue is knocked unconscious. With Marv's help Jack uses his plasma restraints and taser restraints on the pair. Vesper tries to apprehend A-Squad Green, but takes an elbow to face; angering Eddie. As A-Squad Green is defeated Eddie and Vesper quip about the \"[[Easter egg (media)|inferiority]]\" of [[inside joke|thinking]] that a Green Ranger could ever [[Power Rangers Megaforce|replace]] a Black Ranger. Chloe uses another whirlwind attack to dispatch of A-Squad Pink and A-Squad Yellow as an unknown S.P.D. Green Ranger shows up responding to the facility's distress signal. Against Marv's wishes Chloe, followed by Vesper, dog pile on top of him and A-Squad Red as the unnamed S.P.D. Green Ranger contains the five A-Squad Rangers in cards. The S.P.D. Green Ranger reveals herself to be Song, having been promoted in the two years since she had last seen Hyperforce. She explains that the mutant teens had been brought back to health and that S.P.D. had been helping them find a normal means of living off the street. Vesper starts to shut down, feeling overwhelmed emotionally and homesick; so the other Hyperforce Rangers help her back to the time ship. Enraged at Hyperforce interfering yet again; \"The Leader\" has the stolen time ship searched and discovers a tracker Joe had planted on board. With the tracker destroyed and the stolen morpher's signal also gone; the stolen time ship slips back into the time stream. With no clue as what to do next, the Hyperforce Rangers head back to the Time Force Academy in the year 3017. Vesper decides to thank Chloe for helping her earlier during her emotional breakdown by gifting the remaining bomb to her. As Joe debriefs, the Hyperforce Rangers meet up with former classmate Abigail. Vesper and Chloe immediately fill Abigail in on the fun that they've had experimenting with \"illegal\" substances of the 31st century; such as [[sugar]], [[caffeine]] and [[trans fats]]. Abigail then informs them as to what has been happening with \"The Alliance\" in the year 3017 and they become alerted to the fact that additional time ships had been stolen since the initial ship \"The Leader\" stole. The four cadets officially graduate in an informal ceremony, becoming full-fledged Time Force officers. Jack is also promoted a rank. The Hyperforce Rangers then decide to split up to each handle some personal matters before returning to their mission. Vesper and Jack confront Vesper's parents to learn that she was a synthetic organism pioneered by the late man who was both the creator of the Cyclobot technology and their employer; Dr. Louis Fericks. They explain that they had rescued a young Vesper from burning to death the night that the lab was destroyed and how she was named for the star in the night's sky on that fateful day. Meanwhile, Eddie confronts Bianca and they mutually decide to break their arranged engagement, to be nothing more than business partners and casual friends. After showing off her Ranger outfit around the Time Force Academy, Chloe confesses to Abigail why she joined Time Force and asks Abigail to search for more information on her parents. Marv and Joe have a heart to heart about his secret mission, the suffering its caused and how Joe was unaware that his and Hyperforce's missions were connected. The brothers then confront their parents with the news that Joe is alive. A short time later the Hyperforce Rangers meet up and Vesper has gifts in hand from home. Much to Jack's displeasure, he learns that Vesper also secretly took the family dog despite warning her about his phobia to small animals. The Hyperforce Rangers arrive at the burned out remains of the lab where they meet other synthetic organisms created by Dr. Fericks. They reveal to Vesper that they had witnessed the destruction of the lab 17 years earlier at the hands of a mutant known as Ransik and that they had helped Dr. Fericks rebuild himself into the cyborg Frax. Vesper vows that she will help her \"sibling\" synthetic organisms get revenge on Ransik for what he had done to their \"father\" Dr. Fericks.\n----\nNote: Yoshi Sudarso was unable to participate during the first half of the episode due to running late, but joins in towards the end of the second half.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 17\n |Title = Director Ransik\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Time Force Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|02|27}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers inform Vesper that as a Time Force officer it may not be in her best interest to help her synthetic \"siblings\" Spencer, Rory, Jocelyn and Josh in their attempt to get revenge on Ransik now that he has reformed from his criminal ways. The Hyperforce Rangers promise to investigate the matter further, but the synthetics become impatient and further pressure Vesper to help them in their plan for revenge. Vesper refuses and the synthetics attempt to take their leave. Joe teleports in front of the synthetics and tries to stop them making the synthetics become confrontational. As the synthetics make their escape, Eddie and Vesper pull the child like synthetic Josh aside and discover that he is unable to speak due to a malfunctioning voice box. Vesper uses the healing charge technology to repair Josh's ability to speak. The Hyperforce Rangers attempt to gain Josh's trust with one of Chloe's \"aged\" burritos. Marv's attempt to heat the burrito goes awry turning the peace offering to ash, but Joe manages salvage the situation by revealing he still has some food he packed from the visit home. The Hyperforce Rangers decide to make their way to City Hall in order to find out Ransik's latest whereabouts. Joe begins to get cold feet and decides that he has to take care of something before he confronts Ransik. The Hyperforce Rangers pressure Joe into telling them what the problem is. Joe reveals that he was \"sort of\" engaged to Ransik's daughter Nadira before he \"disappeared\" on his secret mission without informing her. The Hyperforce Rangers excuse Joe to take care of the situation as they arrive at City Hall. Vesper comes to the realization that she left her dog Yappy behind at the burned down lab. Chloe responds by pulling the dog from her tote and announces that she has arbitrarily renamed the dog Burrito. Finding the Mutant Rehabilitation Center's doors locked, the Hyperforce Rangers learn from Jack's former boss Chief Petell that Ransik has taken some rehabilitated mutants to the animal shelter to take care of the animals as part of their rehabilitation therapy. Chief Petell then informs Jack that he needs to clean out his old office now that he is a Hyperforce Ranger, much to Jack's disdain. At the animal shelter, the Hyperforce Rangers confront Ransik about the synthetics and learn from Ransik about how he was indeed responsible for both the lab's destruction as well as the final fate of Dr. Fericks after having become the cyborg Frax. At Nadira's house, Joe learns that Nadira has gone to the animal shelter to help her father. Back at the shelter, Josh attempts to destroy Ransik, but the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to distract him. Chloe suggests that throwing Josh in a cage might work, but Vesper considers that \"babysitting\" may require them having to sit on \"baby\" Josh instead. Joe arrives at the shelter to talk to Nadira as Josh informs the Hyperforce Rangers that he has telepathically contacted his synthetic \"siblings\" to alert them of Ransik's presence. As the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to protect Ransik from the synthetics, Vesper manages to tap into Jocelyn's mind and gives Jack enough time to put Jocelyn into stasis. Eddie restrains Josh as Vesper taps into his mind. While inside Josh's mind, Josh informs Vesper that he cannot help but want revenge due to his current programming. Vesper promises Josh that she will help to reprogram him. Chloe manages to put restraints on Spencer, but Spencer breaks away from Chloe and uses the restraints to ricochet Marv's taser blasts back into him. Jack blocks Rory from attacking Ransik as Joe complies to Nadira's pleas to save her father and teleports in to flip Rory to the ground. Vesper manages to transfer her memories of love, family and friendship into Josh; quelling the flames of \"vengeance\" that were burning in his mind. With Josh saved, Josh disengages from Vesper and in turn engages Spencer's mind. Eddie then rushes Vesper to Rory who engages his mind with a kiss. Vesper then complicates things further by sending mixed signals to Eddie in telling him how they can never be more than friends all the while kissing him. Heartbroken, Eddie seeks comfort from Jack and Joe. With three of the synthetics freed of their need for revenge, Jack releases Jocelyn from her stasis so that the same can be done for her. Overwhelmed by all that has happened, Vesper tells the synthetics that she can never be a part of their family as she never grew up with them. Vesper decides she needs some alone time and goes off to think about the recent events. Joe decides to stay behind for a bit to finish his conversation with Nadira and Ransik. Marv and Eddie return to Time Force Academy to prepare the time ship for departure while Chloe and Jack go back to City Hall to clean out Jack's old office. As Jack reminisces about his beat cop days with Chloe, Chief Petell and Jack's old cop buddies show up to give Jack a proper send-off for his new promotion. As they continue to talk Jack learns from Chief Petell that there is a janitor by the name of Steven Lang that is currently in custody who seems to have intimate knowledge of what \"The Alliance\" has in plan. Jack contacts the other Hyperforce Rangers about the potential lead as he and Chloe interrogate the janitor and learn that aside from saving Zordon \"The Alliance\" plans to amass an armada of alien ships from the year 2014.\n----\nNote: This episode did not have a ''Fireside Chat'' due to a [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] charity event that immediately followed the show.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |Title = Stage 4: The Armada\n |Aux1 = Cameron Jebo as Orion, the [[Power Rangers Megaforce|Super Megaforce]] Silver Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|06}}\n | ShortSummary= Following up on the new lead from the janitor the Hyperforce Rangers learn more from Alpha 55 about the Warstar Armada that invaded earth in the year 2014. Alpha 55 informs the Hyperforce Rangers that one of the Rangers responsible for the Armada's defeat came from the planet Andresia who's population was decimated by the Armada. The Hyperforce Rangers decide that this alien Ranger may be able to inform them more about this Armada and travel to the planet Andresia sometime during the year 2013 or 2014; just shortly after the population of Andresia was destroyed by the Armada. Chloe chooses to remain in her Ranger form and throws on Song's ripped trench coat as a disguise. The Hyperforce Rangers become concerned and a tad disgusted as Vesper decides to address Chloe directly about her questionable hygiene for wearing her Ranger costume for weeks on end. Chloe agrees they may be right but nonchalantly chooses to remain morphed anyway. On the planet surface, they meet Orion who is fishing. Vesper confronts Orion and scares away his fish, annoying Orion to a degree. As Vesper reprograms their morphers with a tongue lick to understand Orion's language Eddie makes up for Vesper's transgression by catching two fish for Orion. As Chloe reveals herself to Orion, she is mistaken for a robot by Orion. Angered, Chloe has to be restrained by the other Hyperforce Rangers from attacking Orion. Vesper informs the other Hyperforce Rangers that she has a plan for taking care of the Armada, stating that the remnants of the Venjix [[computer virus|virus]] still remain within her. Orion fills Jack in on how he used to mine ore, how the Armada ships have been loading up on the various ores of the planet, and how he failed to capture an Armada ship after downing it. As Jack continues to learn more from Orion about his past, Vesper mistakes what Orion says as a pickup line and runs off telling Orion that she can't live with hurting another person emotionally. Eddie talks with Marv about how lonely he is seeing how the other Hyperforce Rangers interact with each other. Marv attempts to comfort Eddie, telling him that the Hyperforce Rangers are only so close because of his efforts. Feeling better, Eddie and Marv rejoin Jack and Orion as Orion informs them of how he found his morpher while mining at the quarry. Chloe finds Vesper moping and tries to get her to come back to the rest of the group. Vesper tells Chloe that she thinks that she is broken and has been since Venjix had infected her. Vesper tries to run a diagnostic on herself, but with little success. As the girls make their way back to the rest of the group an Armada ship flies by. The Hyperforce Rangers and Orion follow the Armada ship to the woods. As The Hyperforce Rangers and Orion take cover behind a rock, Eddie combines his water attack with Chloe's whirlwind attack to create a water spout hurricane attack and down an Armada ship. As the remaining Armada ships flee with the recovered X-Borg pilot, the Hyperforce Rangers commandeer the downed Armada ship and start making repairs. Using the remnants of the Venjix virus Vesper configures a new form of the [[Trojan horse (computing)|virus]] and installs it into the repaired Armada ship with a tongue lick, turning the ship into a literal [[Trojan horse]]. Marv informs Orion that it is imperative to preserve the timeline and that he should come up with a cover story to explain how he captured the Armada ship. Chloe suggests that he should say he shot it down with a bow, but Orion decides to go with a slingshot instead. Vesper has Alpha 55 teleport her dog Burrito down and attempts to give the dog to Orion, though Orion declines the offer. Orion says his goodbyes and takes off in the Armada ship as the Hyperforce Rangers return to their time ship. The Hyperforce Rangers travel back to earth slightly farther in the future of the year 2014 having detected a time anomaly during the day of the Legendary Battle. The Hyperforce Rangers are confronted by a message from \"The Leader\" informing them that they are too late to stop him. Chloe activates her Pink Battle Warrior form and enters Emperor Mavro's lead Armada ship as Troy and Orion crash Orion's Armada ship into the side of the lead ship. With Vesper's help, Chloe activates the reconfigured Venjix virus, causing the lead ship to blast many of the smaller Armada ships. Scorpina and Velchanos attempt to abduct the remaining Armada ships for \"The Alliance\" to use, but are forced to retreat after finding their efforts are in vain due to the spreading Venjix virus. As Chloe makes her escape from the lead Armada ship, she uses her whirlwind blast to knock Troy and Orion to safety from the exploding ship. Chloe is damaged from the explosion and is forced to power down to her normal Ranger mode. The Hyperforce Rangers return to their time ship and monitor the Super Megaforce Rangers destroying Emperor Mavro while keeping \"The Alliance\" at bay. With an army of X-Borgs and Bruisers approaching, the Hyperforce Rangers witness the arrival of every legendary Power Ranger and the start of the Legendary Battle. Eddie begs Alpha 55 to let them join in despite the chance of altering the future and Alpha 55 agrees that the legendary Rangers could use the help. During the battle the Hyperforce Rangers come to the aid of many of the legendary Rangers unnoticed, though Marv gets Dr. Oliver's attention when Marv has an epic fail and runs off to hide. Knowing that the Hyperforce Rangers shouldn't be there, Dr. Oliver tries to get the Hyperforce Rangers to leave before they alter the timeline too severely. With the battle won the Hyperforce Rangers offer to return Orion home to Andresia so that he can search for any survivors from the Armada attack. The Hyperforce Rangers then return to the time stream to continue their mission.\n}}\n{{Episode list|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |Title = Shattered Grid Part 1\n |Aux1 = [[Kyle Higgins]] as [[impostor|\"Captain Michael Hicks\"]]<br/>Malika Lim as Colonel Lina Song\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|13}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers become concerned and have Alpha 55 double check to be certain that their plan to sabotage the Armada had been completely successful. Alpha 55 confirms that the modified Venjix virus was completely successful and had spread to the ships beyond earth. Even with their success against \"The Alliance\" plan to acquire the Armada ships, the Hyperforce Rangers continue to be unsettled now knowing that additional time ships were stolen from Time Force and not having any other leads to follow up on beyond preserving Zordon's death in 1998. Vesper decides to [[Breaking the fourth wall|post]] about preserving Zordon's death through social media sites. As Vesper and Chloe nearly coerce Marv into singing with them an alarm sounds out. Alpha 55 declares that a dark energy has emerged from the normal time stream and somehow entered the hyper stream. Believing that \"The Alliance\" may have obtained the ability to enter the hyper stream from one of the additional time ships they had stolen the Hyperforce Rangers decide to investigate. The Hyperforce Rangers find themselves back in Newtech City at an unknown point in time. As they survey the city from their time ship the Hyperforce Rangers find the city oddly familiar and yet different in a surreal dystopian sense. The Hyperforce Rangers decide to go down on foot to get a better look. Vesper overhears an announcement that the curfew was now in effect as Chloe spies a group of individuals that resemble multiple Mighty Morphin Black Rangers. Eddie decides to investigate the mysterious group of Black Rangers further when he is hit with a spotlight and told to drop to his knees. Vesper tries to come to Eddie's aid, but is also stopped. Not tolerant of Vesper's antics, one of the Black Rangers hits Vesper upside the head with the butt of his gun. Marv gains the attention of the Black Rangers as he morphs in a massive explosion and takes out the Black Ranger that had hit Vesper. Chloe and Jack join in on the fight as Eddie kicks the unconscious Black Ranger for hurting Vesper. Eddie then disarms another Black Ranger and tosses the gun at the Black Ranger manning the spot light from the guard tower to take him out. Dazed and possibly suffering from a concussion, Vesper morphs with the awkward phrase of \"Its Torphin Mime\" and chops down another one of the guard towers with her weapon. As the battle continues on the Hyperforce Rangers are saved by a group of soldiers led by Captain Michael Hicks. On their way to the soldiers base of operations Marv tries to talk to Vesper about being reckless, but Vesper informs Marv that she would rather be injured herself than to have someone she loves get injured as she is more replaceable. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to follow the soldiers back to their base Captain Hicks recognizes that these Rangers are not of this reality. Captain Hicks informs the Hyperforce Rangers that this is not the first time the resistance, known as \"The Coinless\", has met Rangers from an alternate timeline and fills them in on what had happened to their world. Captain Hicks asks the Hyperforce Rangers what they knew of Tommy Oliver's past, to which they draw a blank despite Eddie's best effort to remember past Dino Thunder. Captain Hicks informs the Hyperforce Rangers that in most realities Tommy had at one point been the Mighty Morphin Green Ranger under a spell working for Rita Repulsa. Unlike other realities though, when the spell was broken in this reality Tommy chose to remain on the side of evil, helping Rita Repulsa to kill Zordon and most of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers slowly. In a last-ditch effort, the Ninjor of this reality helped to create the White Tiger coin for Jason, but Jason was killed and the coin was claimed by Tommy. With both the Dragon coin and White Tiger coin in hand, Tommy fused the two together to create a new hybrid coin and was renamed Lord Drakkon after one of the warriors who had served Rita Repulsa 10,000 years ago. Using the stolen Mastodon, Sabre-tooth Tiger, Pterodactyl and Tyrannosaurus coins Lord Drakkon created death squadrons known as the Ranger Sentries to enforce Rita Respulsa's rule upon the earth. Eventually Lord Zedd would also join in on the conquest of earth and captured Newtech City. Lord Drakkon then turned on Rita and Zedd, eventually toppling both and taking complete control of the planet for himself. Captain Hicks further explains that \"The Coinless\" would eventually be aided by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers of an [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|alternate timeline]] and that the alternate Billy would use the only coin of this reality not stolen, the Triceratops coin, to create an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] disabling Lord Drakkon and his Ranger Sentries from morphing before those alternate Mighty Morphin Rangers disappeared back to their reality and seemingly taking Lord Drakkon back with them. With a power vacuum left in Lord Drakkon's absence, the evil forces that were under him have begun to splinter off to take control of the world. The dominant faction is lead by the alternate Mighty Morphin reality's Scorpina, who seeks the power for herself. Another faction remains loyal to Lord Drakkon and is led by his cyborg assistant Finster 5. The Hyperforce Rangers are disturbed that such a reality could possibly exist. As the Hyperforce Rangers meet the leader of the soldiers they learn that the Colonel is this alternate reality's version of Lina Song. Seeing the deplorable state that the people live in, Chloe tries to get Alpha 55 to beam down the half rotten junk food from under her bed. Alpha 55 chastises Chloe for the mess, so Vesper promises to Chloe that she'll reprogram Alpha 55 later so that he doesn't remember. Colonel Song observes that Vesper and Chloe are rather odd and asks if perhaps they may be \"[[special needs|special]]\" to which Chloe responds to with an enthusiastic yes as she goes into Pink Battle Warrior form. Chloe then makes burritos for the soldiers and other Hyperforce Rangers using meat from the assorted animals she could find in the sewers. The Hyperforce Rangers and soldiers come up with a plan to rescue some of \"The Coinless\" from one of Scorpina's prisons,  but Colonel Song warns that they must be cautious as the Ranger Sentries may unleash \"The Great Destroyer\" upon them. The soldiers Major Galushi, Scout Fidget and Private Rice decide to sneak into the prison using an underground tunnel while most of the Hyperforce Rangers cause a distraction at the prison's main gate by using the explosions of Jack's morph and the spare bomb Vesper had gifted to Chloe after having dealt with the S.P.D. A-Squad. Marv summons his Lion Hyper Zord to deal with the Mastodon and Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries as Colonel Song and Vesper make their way to the server room and download documents pertaining to \"The Great Destroyer\", the nickname given to this reality's Serpentera; Lord Zedd's War Zord. The rescued members of \"The Coinless\" inform the other soldiers and the Hyperforce Rangers that the person they've been calling \"Captain Hicks\" is an impostor as they witnessed the fate of the real Captain Hicks. \"Captain Hicks\" reveals himself to be Finster 5's monster Pumpkin Rapper and starts a rap battle with Eddie. The Hyperforce Rangers do massive damage to Pumpkin Rapper, forcing him to grow in an unstable manner and risking explosion. Jack and Eddie try to save as many of the prisoners as they can while Chloe and Marv blasts Pumpkin Rapper. Rather than continuing the fight, Pumpkin Rapper decides to inflict as much damage as possible by going into self destruct mode and suicide bombs the prison and Hyper Zords. The Hyper Zords remain mostly unscathed from the blast, however Jack and Vesper are both badly injured in the blast with Jack being forced out of morph. The Hyperforce Rangers become disillusioned and emotionally shell-shocked when they realize the full extent of the blast. Many of the Ranger Sentries had been vaporized and nearly all the prisoners they had tried to save were killed. As Marv, Chloe, and Eddie check on Vesper and Jack they are surrounded by incoming trucks filled with Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries. A squad of Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentries then drops in from an airship along with a menacing figure that the Hyperforce Rangers immediately recognize from the propaganda posters. Lord Drakkon has returned.\n----\nNotes: 1. This is the first episode to feature more than one guest player.\n\n2.

The figure makes his way to the nearest coffee shop as people run for cover. The figure is revealed to be Lord Drakkon. Lord Drakkon makes a call on his communicator and requests for an immediate transport pickup back to Angel Grove. The Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry on other end informs Lord Drakkon that the Scorpina of the alternate Mighty Morphin reality has staged a coup d'\u00e9tat in his absence and has made a play to capture Serpentera. Lord Drakkon changes his plan and informs the Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry to have the transport take him to Newtech City instead. Flash forward back to the present, the Hyperforce Rangers are surrounded by Lord Drakkon and the Ranger Sentries. Alpha 55 informs the Hyperforce Rangers that they are in the presence of the dark energy they had detected earlier in the hyper stream. Emotionally distraught by the charred bodies of dead prisoners strewn about, Chloe lets her temper get the better of her and lashes out, attempting to take out Lord Drakkon as Marv tries to hold her back. Lord Drakkon demands that the Hyperforce Rangers submit to his will and help him obtain Serpentera before Scorpina has a chance to activate it. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to disobey Lord Drakkon decides to show that he is not in the mood to play games. The surviving prisoners and soldiers of \"The Coinless\" are round up as a demonstration. Lord Drakkon decapitates Private Rice, his head dropping to the ground in front of an emotional Chloe. Marv pleads as Lord Drakkon then begins to order the execution of everyone. Eventually Marv convinces Lord Drakkon that the Hyperforce Rangers will submit to his will and Lord Drakkon lets most of the remaining prisoners and soldiers go, but not before placing an explosive collar around Colonel Song's neck and threatening to blow her up should they have a change of heart. As the survivors leave one of the rescued members of \"The Coinless\", Zack Taylor, promises that this isn't over and tells the Hyperforce Rangers that he'll send for help. As Lord Drakkon, the Hyperforce Rangers and the Ranger Sentries make their way to the last known location of Serpentera a few of the Hyperforce Rangers try to make small talk with Lord Drakkon. As Marv distracts Lord Drakkon, Eddie manages to scan the bomb around Colonel Song's neck and send schematics to Alpha 55. Marv convinces Lord Drakkon to let Eddie heal Jack with the healing charge technology, but as Alpha 55 responds back about receiving the schematics Lord Drakkon becomes annoyed and threatens to detonate the bomb if the Hyperforce Rangers continue their shenanigans. As the group makes their way to Scorpina's base and what appears to be a mountain range, Vesper tries to negotiate the safety of the other Hyperforce Rangers further angering Lord Drakkon and forcing Jack to step in. A pair of Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries from guard towers order Lord Drakkon and the Hyperforce Rangers to surrender. Lord Drakkon demands the Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries to stand down and submit to his will. When the Ranger Sentries ignore his command, Lord Drakkon destroys both Ranger Sentries and the guard towers with a series of kicks. As the alarms sound, Eddie is forced to team up with Lord Drakkon and fight back to back. Lord Drakkon's attention is caught as he witnesses Chloe goes into her Pink Battle Warrior form and use one of her whirlwind attacks to take out a pair of Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentries. Marv defeats the remaining Sabre-tooth Tiger Ranger Sentry while Lord Drakkon's Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentries gain entry into the side of the mountain range. The Hyperforce Rangers are alarmed by the dark aura. As Chloe begins to break down Marv promises her that he will not allow any more deaths to happen this day. As Eddie gets ahead of Lord Drakkon's Ranger Sentries he is nearly cut down by a saw when he accidentally triggers a trap. The Ranger Sentries warn the Hyperforce Rangers to not run ahead like fools. After failing to make small talk with Lord Drakkon and having a conversation about trust with Eddie, Vesper tries to trigger all the traps at once with her Cerberus Disc, breaking her weapon. Eddie picks up the remains of Vesper's weapon. Not impressed, Lord Drakkon motions them to continue onward. Misunderstanding Lord Drakkon's demands, some of the Hyperforce Rangers begin to bow to Lord Drakkon while others defy him. Lord Drakkon becomes further annoyed by the delay and demands that the Hyperforce Rangers move towards the bow of Serpentera. Vesper continues to ping her location to \"The Coinless\" as Scorpina confronts Lord Drakkon. Scorpina orders the Ranger Sentries loyal to her to make their way to the nearest city to murder the entire population. Vesper and Marv stay inside Serpentera to help Lord Drakkon as the other Hyperforce Rangers chase after Scorpina's Ranger Sentries to stop them. As Chloe makes her way out one of the Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentries turn on the others and frees Colonel Song from the bomb around her neck. Chloe then punches the mystery Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry out cold to maintain his cover as a double agent. Eddie takes the bomb while he and Chloe call upon their Hyper Zords to take out the Ranger Sentry trucks heading to the city. Chloe destroys one of the trucks with her Phoenix Hyper Zord while Eddie uses his Serpent Hyper Zord to launch the bomb to destroy another one of the trucks. Jack and Colonel Song make their way to the city as Eddie saves many of the civilians with his Hyper Zord. Jack calls upon his Hyper Zord to deal with the remaining Ranger Sentry trucks. Chloe picks up one of the trucks filled with bombs and tosses it to its destruction. Colonel Song then jumps on board one of the trucks and disarms a Mastodon Ranger Sentry of his rocket launcher before launching the rocket at another Ranger Sentry. The Ranger Sentry goes hurling into the side of another truck, rocket embedded in his chest, destroying the truck. Abandoning the truck, the remaining Mastodon Ranger Sentry crashes the truck with Colonel Song on board into the side of Jack's Hyper Zord, badly injuring Colonel Song in the explosion. Colonel Song limps away as the Mastodon Ranger Sentry pursues. After a brief scuffle Colonel Song emerges victorious and defeats the Ranger Sentry. Meanwhile back at the mountain range, the mountain range begins to rise into the sky revealing itself to be Serpentera. Lord Drakkon kicks down the door to Serpentera's cockpit hitting Scorpina upside the head. Marv and Lord Drakkon team up and defeat Scorpina, blasting Scorpina outside of Serpentera. Lord Drakkon then grabs Scorpina as Marv uses a pair of restraints to cuff Scorpina. Lord Drakkon attempts to kill Scorpina, but is stopped by Marv. Marv, mistaking this Scorpina as the Scorpina of \"The Alliance\" due to all the alternate universe talk, disagrees with Lord Drakkon thinking that Scorpina might be more useful alive. Finally deciding that he has had enough of Marv, Lord Drakkon attempts to take Marv's morpher. Scorpina laughs at Marv while attempting to topple all three of them off of Serpentera to their deaths. Lord Drakkon manages to save himself while holding onto Scorpina, but Marv falls off the side of Serpentera. Chloe attempts to save Marv, but comes under fire from enemy Ranger Sentry planes. Luckily for Marv another airship shows up in time piloted by Bulk of \"The Coinless\", who saves him from certain death. While all this is going on, Vesper names one of the Ranger Sentries Georgie as she attempts to hack into Serpentera to reprogram it. The first attempt isn't successful and Vesper is badly injured. Vesper attempts to heal herself by repeatedly morphing,  but only succeeds in badly injuring Georgie with the morphed explosions. After a second attempt Vesper is successful in reprogramming Serpentera and sends it on a collision course with the ocean going at full speed. Lord Drakkon jumps inside Serpentera and decides that he is going to finish off Vesper once and for all. Against all advice from Alpha 55, Eddie risks death by doing a blind teleport through solid matter into Serpentera. As Eddie appears to save Vesper, Vesper jumps in front of Lord Drakkon to protect Eddie. Using the blunt end of the saber that is the headless corpse of Saba, Lord Drakkon slices off Vesper's left arm. Eddie grabs hold of Vesper and teleports away as her arm falls to the ground. Serpentera slams into the ocean in a massive impact explosion killing Georgie as Chloe finishes off the remaining Ranger Sentry planes attacking the time ship. At near-death, Vesper is rushed to the medical bay of the time ship carried by Eddie as she begins to lose consciousnesses from the massive blood loss. Using the healing charge technology, Eddie stabilizes Vesper and he begins work on making Vesper a prosthesis arm. At the crash site of Serpentera, Lord Drakkon emerges with an unconscious Scorpina in hand. A Tyrannosaurus Ranger Sentry informs Lord Drakkon that Serpentera will be repaired and operational within a month. Back at the time ship Alpha 55 informs the Hyperforce Rangers that he has received a message and that they must time travel further into the future of this alternate reality or all will be lost. The Hyperforce Rangers' time ship then enters the hyper stream to jump further ahead in time of this alternate reality. To be continued in the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n----\nNotes: 1.

A direct continuation of the previous episode; this episode is also based on the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n\n3. This marks the first time Jason David Frank has portrayed his evil comic book counterpart [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Lord Drakkon]] in any official capacity beyond an advertisement for the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n\n4. It was announced at the end of this episode that the conclusion to the ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' story within the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event would take place within the actual ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' comics from [[Boom! Studios]] themselves. Due to this, the next episode takes place after the resolution of the '''Shattered Grid''' comic book event.\n\n5. It was also announced during this episode that ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' would receive a special bonus episode separate from the 25 main story episodes that were scheduled.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 21\n |Title = Enter The Green Ranger\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Hyperforce Green Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|27}}\n | ShortSummary= The Hyperforce Rangers are on board the time ship traveling through the hyper stream discussing \"The Leader\" when Marv notices that the strap on his morpher is torn. Confused, the Hyperforce Rangers look around and Vesper freaks out at the sight of her severed arm. In its place, Vesper finds a less elegant, robotic prosthetic arm of 3-D printed parts colored black and chrome. While lacking the pioneering eloquence of Vesper's original synthetic organic limb, Eddie finds through experimentation of the limb's buttons that the arm is none the less technologically advanced in its own right by featuring various weapon systems. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to look around for changes Marv asks Alpha 55 if the time ship may have experienced a time anomaly. Vesper, however, comes to the conclusion that Alpha 55 intentionally cut her arm off out of jealousy and attempts to take it out on him. As Alpha 55 breaks away he reminds Vesper that if anyone has been dismantling anyone it was her while pointing out his missing ankles used for the Hyperforce Rangers' weapons. Chloe becomes envious of Vesper's new prosthetic arm and asks Marv to cut off her arm so that she can also get a prosthetic. Looking through the data Marv comes to the conclusion that nearly a month's worth of time is unaccounted for and Alpha 55 discovers numerous messages from Joe. In the first message, Joe announces that he and Nadira have set a wedding date and invites the Hyperforce Rangers to attend. In the second message, Joe states that Jen Scotts wants to meet with him about something important. As the messages continue on Joe becomes more worried about not receiving a reply back and explains that he is setting out to find the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship. In the final message, Joe mentions that he has mysteriously woken up back in bed on his wedding day and that he has no recollection of the missing time. The Hyperforce Rangers return to the year 3017 and scramble to prepare for the wedding ceremony in time with Eddie leading the way. At the wedding reception, Marv and Jack remain uneasy about the loss of time and Marv attempts to pull Joe aside to talk, but with little success. Upon learning about the food Chloe sneaks away and begins to secretly eat the wedding cake before the cutting. Vesper meanwhile goes off to a corner of the room with Eddie; still fuming about Alpha 55 and her missing arm. Marv attempts to dance with several of the women, but with little success. As Marv asks for advice about what he is doing wrong, Vesper attempts to set Marv up with Chloe. After coming upon and startling Chloe, Marv discovers that Chloe's face is covered in frosting and her mouth is fully engorged with cake. Jack steps in wondering what the commotion is all about. After Marv shows off his dance moves Chloe reveals that women won't dance with him because his facial expression makes it look like he is farting. As Chloe attempts to help Marv by slapping the expression off of his face Joe discovers the partially ate cake and screams at Chloe. Chloe rubs the cake from her hands and face onto Abigail and attempts to pass the blame onto her while taking off. Finally getting a chance to talk, Joe reveals to the Hyperforce Rangers that he is going to join them on their mission to stop \"The Alliance\" on a more permanent basis. As the Hyperforce Rangers continue to make small talk at the wedding reception they receive an incoming message from Alpha 55. Vesper takes the message and further antagonizes Alpha 55 while it is revealed that an individual known as [[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Sentinel Knight]] needs their help immediately. The Hyperforce Rangers and Joe are forced to leave the wedding reception early; much to Nadira's disappointment. As the time ship enters the hyper stream and goes off to the month of December in the year 2007 the Hyperforce Rangers and Joe learn from Eddie about Sentinel Knight and the Corona Aurora; the Crown of the Gods. Vesper questions how Joe could possibly help to which Joe reveals a new morpher from Jen Scotts. Chloe becomes somber as she reflects upon the wedding and begins to think of what her wedding might one day be like without her parents. Marv tells Chloe that maybe the Corona Aurora might be able to bring her parents back to her. In 2007 the Hyperforce Rangers find the Sentinel Knight at the Neda Waterfalls in Kyparissia, Greece. Sentinel Knight informs the Hyperforce Rangers that after the Operation Overdrive Rangers had recovered the Corona Aurora he hid the crown on Aquatar, but now some dark entity is trying to claim it. The time ship makes its way to Aquatar with the Sentinel Knight as Chloe freaks as she finds out that Burrito the dog has eaten all of her \"aged\" burritos and swollen to ten times his previous size. Elsewhere in the universe \"The Leader\" is accompanied by Scorpina, Velchanos, and four mysterious aliens, two snorting like pigs, as he recruits Lokar to \"The Alliance\" cause. On Aquatar the Sentinel Knight leads the Hyperforce Rangers to a dormant volcano where they see two mysterious blue pig aliens. The Hyperforce Rangers learn from Sentinel Knight that the aliens are Hydro Jr. and Hogz Jr.; the offspring of the deceased [[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers|Hydro Hog]], Emperor of the Dark Waters. As the Hyperforce Rangers attempt to sneak up the volcano Joe is spotted and has the water sucked out of his body. The Hyperforce Rangers morph and attack the two aliens, but both prove to be formidable. Eddie attempts to use his water abilities to return the stolen water from the aliens to Joe's body but is damaged. Jack frees Eddie from the aliens' grasp and Vesper breaks her Cerberus Axe while pulling it out. Vesper takes note to make Alpha 55 pay for it later. Joe morphs into the Hyperforce Green Ranger for the first time and lunges at Hydro Jr. in a barrage of sword strikes. Eddie fires a rocket from Vesper's robotic arm and topples Hogz Jr. to the ground. Marv and Jack attempt to cryo-freeze the pair but they manage to dodge with minimal damage. As Sentinel Knight is dragged up the volcano by Hogz Jr. Jack rams into the alien sending him flying. Jack and Sentinel Knight hurry to the volcano's peak and jump in to retrieve the Corona Aurora. As they land Sentinel Knight nearly loses his footing near the magma's edge and is steadied by Jack. Chloe's whirlwind attack backfires as her leg is grabbed by Hydro Jr. and both are buried in the sand. Eddie frees Chloe by giving her super strength with his experimental \"Birthrito\", a birthday cake burrito combination, before slamming the pair of aliens near the base of the volcano with a \"water hand\" attack that kills one of them. With Hydro Jr. dead Hogz Jr. tries to escape but is cryo-frozen by Marv. With the water frozen inside him, Hogz Jr. shatters to pieces and dies. As Jack and Sentinel Knight escape with the Corona Aurora in hand the volcano erupts. Eddie and Chloe combine their water and wind powers to buy the needed time for the team to escape the pyroclastic flow. Back on board the time ship the Hyperforce Rangers observe the formation of \"Burrito Island\". Chloe decides not to use the Corona Aurora to revive her parents partly because she believes them to be alive and partly out of fear that they may come back as zombies if they were deceased. Chloe instead asks Sentinel Knight to give her the robot arm from her drawing. Sentinel Knight avoids the request by tricking Chloe to go build it herself. Vesper also makes a request of Sentinel Knight to have both of her broken weapons repaired and for her old arm back while blaming Alpha 55. Sentinel Knight also avoids fulfilling these requests when Alpha 55 chimes in that he'll just repair Vesper's weapons. As Alpha 55 walks away with the broken weapons in hand Vesper warns him that she'll be watching him. The time ship makes its way back to earth in the year 2007 to drop Sentinel Knight back home as Eddie connects the time ship's hologram emitters to the wedding reception in the year 3017 so that Joe can have his first dance with his wife Nadira. Elsewhere \"The Leader\" looks upon earth in the year 2007 from his dark chamber on board the stolen time ship. He vows he will destroy the Sentinel Knight and claim the Corona Aurora for himself.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |Title = Fight for the Corona Aurora\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Hyperforce Green Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|04|03}}\n | ShortSummary= As Joe continues to dance with his wife Nadira through the hologram transmission from 3017 Vesper tells Sentinel Knight that he owes her a favor. Vesper tries to gain access to the crown as the Sentinel Knight warns the Hyperforce Rangers of the dangers of any evil entity that attempts to obtain the Corona Aurora at all costs. Jack has Alpha 55 scan the Corona Aurora's power and asks Alpha 55 to keep him informed of any time anomalies. Marv talks to Sentinel Knight about the Knight's past with the Operation Overdrive Rangers and asks for help to become stronger with his power to combine as a Battlizer. Sentinel Knight tells Marv to look toward his inner strength, but promises to help train him. Vesper makes small talk with Eddie, then [[psychological manipulation|attempts]] to [[emotional blackmail|coerce]] him into [[guilt trip|helping]] her get a hold of the Corona Aurora. Eddie decides that helping Vesper wouldn't be a good idea. So Vesper contemplates getting Chloe's help, but tries to give her dog Burrito to Sentinel Knight instead. After that fails and Chloe also refuses to help, Vesper simply asks Sentinel Knight to touch the crown all the while throwing Eddie under the bus by suggesting that it was his idea. Vesper wishes for a Battlizer as she touches the crown, but nothing happens. Vesper however does make note to scan a blueprint of the Corona Aurora's physical dimensions and external appearance into her memory. Arriving back at the Neda Waterfalls in Kyparissia, Greece in the year 2007, Sentinel Knight begins to train Marv. As Marv and Sentinel Knight train \"The Leader\" sends forth the monster [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Doomstone]]. Marv wields the sword [[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Excelsior]], now no longer merged with Sentinel Knight's body, against Doomstone. Before Marv can attack Doomstone however the monster revives two other fallen monsters that had been destroyed by past Power Rangers and runs away. The first fallen monster the Hyperforce Rangers see they instantly recognize as the Shibarai. The other fallen monster however, [[Power Rangers Ninja Storm|Beevil]], is one the Hyperforce Rangers do not recognize. Vesper summons her Cerberus Disc, but starts to berate Alpha 55 after finding that it is still broken. Eddie takes the broken pieces and begins to work on them as Vesper fights Beevil. Marv attempts to use Excelsior, but then realizes from his memory that the sword will only work with an artificial life form. Marv hands the sword to Vesper who uses it to become the Black Sentinel Ranger. As Eddie completes repairing and upgrading the Cerberus Disc into a spinning top, he is surprised to see Vesper has become the Black Sentinel Ranger. \"The Leader\" uses his power to send down beams of dark energy making the Shibarai and Beevil grow. Jack summons his Crius Cannon to attack Beevil's knee and Joe follows up by attacking the same knee. Sentinel Knight uses his energy to enhance the Hyperforce Rangers abilities. As Chloe's team attack with Vesper fails, Eddie summons his Serpent Hyper Zord and unleashes a pair of water fists attacks on the monsters. Beevil takes the brunt of the damage as Shibarai manages to repel the water fist attack. Annoyed, \"The Leader\" sends down Velchanos and a squad of Putties to steal the Corona Aurora from Sentinel Knight while the Hyperforce Rangers are distracted. Hearing the Putties, Joe senses that Sentinel Knight is in danger and rushes in. Joe arrives in time to lend one of his Hydra Blades to an already injured Sentinel Knight, who uses the blade to knock Velchanos back. After being rammed by Jack's Ram Hyper Zord, Vesper uses the Cerberus Zord to finish off Beevil. In a last-ditch attempt before exploding Beevil tries to pull Vesper out of her cockpit, but fails. The Hyperforce Rangers summon the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord and grab the Shibarai. With the monster within their grasp, they blast the Shibarai at point-blank range with repeated flamethrower bursts and a barrage of missiles, causing the Shibarai to shrink back down to human size from the damage. Joe takes out several of the Putties as Velchanos steals the Corona Aurora from Sentinel Knight. As \"The Leader\" arrives to claim the crown from Velchanos he becomes distracted by his obsession of destroying the Sentinel Knight. Joe calls for assistance as he attacks Velchanos. Running away, the Shibarai arrives at the location of \"The Leader\" with the Hyperforce Rangers close behind. Annoyed at the Shibarai's incompetence, \"The Leader\" drains the rest of the Shibarai's energy; destroying the monster. The Hyperforce Rangers partially heal Sentinel Knight using the healing charge technology as Vesper attempts to trick Velchanos into giving up the Corona Aurora by making a duplicate hologram crown from her memory. \"The Leader\" attempts to strip the decoy crown from Vesper's grasp and becomes aware of the ploy. \"The Leader\" body slams Vesper to the ground with the full force of his dark energy. Sentinel Knight comes to Vesper's aid by attacking \"The Leader\", but falls upon Vesper instead. After Jack's Ram Hyper Zord missile attack fails to knock the crown from Velchanos's head, Chloe uses her Phoenix Hyper Zord to pin him in between a pair of feathers, Joe and Marv. Using a combined attack Joe and Marv manage to strip the Corona Aurora from Velchanos. As Marv makes a run for it with the Corona Aurora in hand Eddie professes his love for Vesper while giving his Serpent Hyper Zord's all to destroy \"The Leader\". Vesper tells Eddie that she loves him with all her heart as \"The Leader\" easily brushes off the damage. Now knowing what Eddie cares for the most, \"The Leader\" unleashes the full force of his dark energy into Vesper at point blank range. The dark energy surges into and flows through Vesper's body, rattling her synthetic bones. Unable to contain the energy, it begins to spill out, burning and bursting forth through gaping wounds within Vesper's body and ricocheting off her Black Sentinel Ranger armor. As the energy burns out of her retinas, Vesper is completely obliterated from existence.\n----\nNotes: 1. Meghan Camarena was absent from participating in this episode. Rather than make up an excuse to explain Chloe's absence as had been done in past cases where a Hyperforce Ranger couldn't play; in this case the [[gamemaster|Game Master]] Malika Lim simply chose to play Chloe as an [[non-player character|NPC]] with minimal interaction with the other Hyperforce Rangers. Meghan Camarena does make a brief cameo appearance in the episode however through the earlier filmed stock footage used for the morph sequence.\n\n2. Yoshi Sudarso is credited as a guest player in the opening title sequence for the first time. While this is not new for other guest players to have appeared in the show; in this particular case its more likely an indicator to Yoshi's more permanent inclusion into the show for the remainder of the season.\n\n3. This episode did not have a ''Fireside Chat''.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 23\n |Title = Rebirth\u2026 Kind Of\n |Aux1 = Yoshi Sudarso as Joseph \"Joe\" Shih, the Hyperforce Green Ranger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|04|10}}\n | ShortSummary= Proud of the damage that he has caused by killing Vesper, \"The Leader\" escalates the battle further by chanting an incantation to create a dark force field that prevents the Hyperforce Rangers from escaping with the Corona Aurora. \"The Leader\" attempts to make a deal with the Hyperforce Rangers, the crown for their freedom and the charred corpse of Vesper. Eddie argues intensely with Marv about not giving the crown away as Chloe exits her Phoenix Hyper Zord and transforms into her Pink Battle Warrior form. Jack attempts to hit the force field with his Ram Hyper Zord, but only succeeds in damaging his Hyper Zord in the process. Desperate to puncture the force field, Marv sends out a beam of energy that ricochets back into him. Sentinel Knight tries to talk Marv into turning over the Corona Aurora, but after hearing Marv's agony in submitting to the demands of \"The Leader\" he chooses to attack instead. \"The Leader\" easily dodges as Sentinel Knight bounces off the force field. Velchanos summons more Putties, but Eddie makes quick work of them with his Serpent Hyper Zord as he threatens \"The Leader\". \"The Leader\" stomps Vesper's corpse into the ground in response to the threats as Joe runs in to attack. \"The Leader\" grabs Joe by the neck nearly killing him. As Chloe argues with Marv, who is on the verge of breaking down, she starts to hear a voice inside her head to destroy the crown. Chloe snatches the Corona Aurora from Marv's hands. Marv tries to reclaim the Corona Aurora, but fails as Chloe unleashes the full force of her attack upon the crown; vaporizing it. As the crown is destroyed Alpha 55 manages to send a message to Joe that penetrates the force field. \"The Leader\" clutches his chest in pain at the destruction of the Corona Aurora. Using the moment to his advantage, Marv rushes in and grabs both Vesper's corpse and Joe. Not wanting \"The Leader\" to escape; Chloe in her Pink Battle Warrior form along with Eddie and Jack in their Hyper Zords blasts \"The Leader\" for damage. Sentinel Knight also attacks \"The Leader\" for added damage. Eddie exits his Hyper Zord to be close to Vesper as Jack attempts again to breach the force field, but with no success. \"The Leader\" has Velchanos grow as he makes his escape. Hearing the message from Alpha 55 that his Hyper Zord is now available, Joe transfers his chest shield to Marv and calls upon the Hydra Hyper Zord. The Hydra Hyper Zord smashes through the force field. Joe and Sentinel Knight use the Hydra Hyper Zord to keep Velchanos at bay as the other Hyperforce Rangers make their way to the time ship. Eddie has Alpha 55 control the Cerberus Hyper Zord to form the Chronos Hyperforce Megazord as Chloe warns the Hyperforce Rangers never to speak of this moment to Vesper if she ever \"gets better\". After launching Velchanos into the air with a water uppercut, Velchanos reciprocates by throwing chunks of flaming rocks at the Hyperforce Rangers. The Hydra Hyper Zord hits Velchanos with laser blasts stunning him. In a symbolic act, Eddie destroys Velchanos with the Cerberus arm; smashing Velchanos with a tsunami water blast. Back on board the time ship Alpha 55 becomes distressed at the sight of Vesper's charred corpse. The time ship jumps into the hyper stream as Vesper's body is rushed to the medical bay to be scanned. Elsewhere \"The Leader\" walks toward a mysterious man in a lab coat surrounded by advanced Time Force technology. \"The Leader\" admits his failure to the mysterious man. The mysterious man is not too concerned however; stating that the destruction of the Corona Aurora only proved his theory that a [[Temporal paradox|new timeline]] had been created as \"The Leader\" was still alive. The mysterious man further elaborates that in the previous timeline \"The Leader\" was only alive because two years prior they were successful in obtaining the crown from this same confrontation that now saw its destruction. Back on board the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship as Vesper's body is scanned, Alpha 55 powers down and begins to act strangely after rebooting. Meanwhile an angry Eddie tries to punch Marv in the face for attempting to give the Corona Aurora to \"The Leader\" and allowing Chloe to destroy the crown, but is stopped mid-swing by Chloe grabbing his arm. As Eddie breaks down crying Joe comforts Eddie. Sentinel Knight magically takes his leave of the time ship to go back to his time of 2007 to prepare in case the worst possible situation occurs as a result of these recent events. Jack examines footage of \"The Leader\" to see if he can figure out what his exact deal is following the recent events. Chloe helps Joe heal with medical supplies and an old burrito she found from under her bed. Eddie looks at old photos of Vesper as Marv tries to console him and Eddie comes up with an epiphany. Eddie goes off to find Jack who has come to a similar epiphany. Eddie begins searching for a point in time where \"The Leader\" can absorb massive amounts of good and bad energy connected to the Morphin Grid. Elsewhere in the time ship Vesper's consciousness comes online inside of Alpha 55 absent of all of her memories. Vesper begins to harvest all the knowledge from Alpha 55's memory as well as all knowledge of the Alphas that came before. As Vesper begins to freak out the Hyperforce Rangers come running to see why Alpha 55 is screaming. Alpha 55 tells the Hyperforce Rangers that she is really Vesper as Marv comes in with Vesper's corpse after Joe tells him to bring it. Vesper yells at the Hyperforce Rangers for destroying her body and argues out loud with the voice of Alpha 55 inside her head. Chloe and Eddie pass out from the revelation. Feeling uncomfortable in this new form, Vesper has Alpha 55 put on her bra and panties to feel more like her old self. Alpha 55 reveals to Vesper that her secret project away from the Hyperforce Rangers under the ruse of \"sleeping\" from an earlier time was really her creating a back-up copy of her consciousness should she ever die. Unfortunately because the back-up was made at an earlier time, the memories in the back-up were not kept up to date to the present time of her body's death. Joe nicknames Alpha 55 and Vesper sharing a body \"Vespa\" and the Hyperforce Rangers discuss way to help get Vesper a new body. Vesper refuses to have anything to do with her old body since its now gross and she doesn't want to be a zombie, so \"Vespa\" tries several times to throw it away. \"Vespa\" then takes Vesper's morpher and tries to morph, but is unable to due to not having DNA anymore to activate the morpher's unlock sequence. Eddie heals Joe further with the healing charge technology and \"Vespa\" shocks Joe for annoying Vesper in various ways; such as requesting repeatedly to dye her hair black. Checking with Alpha 55's data for a point in time that \"The Leader\" may use to obtain large amounts of energy at Eddie's request, Vesper and the other Hyperforce Rangers become aware of the Red Space Ranger Andros and the United Alliance of Evil. Eddie and Jack decide that getting Vesper a new body should be their first priority and come to the conclusion that the destroyed lab of the late Dr. Fericks in the year 3017 would be the best place to start. Vesper takes a moment alone to mourn her old body as Alpha 55 informs her that it may be possible to retrieve her old memories from the chip embedded within her skull. Marv takes a moment to apologize to Chloe for his earlier actions with the Corona Aurora. The Hyperforce Rangers contact Time Force and requests for the help of all available man power throughout time and space. The Hyperforce Rangers then have the time ship travel to the year 3017 to comb through the destroyed lab before going to pick up their potential allies to stop \"The Alliance\" in the year 1998. Meanwhile already in the year 1998 on the Cimmerian Planet \"The Leader\" walks among the various leaders of the United Alliance of Evil at Dark Specter's gathering spot. \"The Leader\" comes across Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, who become curious as to who would dare approach them. \"The Leader\" lowers his hood revealing dark energy pulsing from his exposed brain and heavily bandaged face; declaring that he will restore his family's legacy and that Zordon must not be allowed to die. Back on board the Hyperforce Ranger's time ship \"Vespa\" feels up and down his arms as Vesper's consciousness probes Alpha 55's mind of his darkest secret to which Alpha 55 replies that it is his confusion of Vesper's sporadic intentions.\n----\nNotes: 1. Zac Eubank has a brief [[non-player character|NPC]] cameo appearance in this episode, portraying the mysterious man in a lab coat.\n\n2.

As he begins to make his way to the dinner table he is grabbed by Joe and is teleported to the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship. Confused as to what has happened, the Hyperforce Rangers try to fill Andros in on the threat of \"The Leader\" while delicately trying to avoid altering history. On board the time ship Andros meets other allies of the Hyperforce Rangers that have traversed time and space to come and help upon receiving the Hyperforce Rangers' message: the wizard [[Merlin]], the [[Power Rangers S.P.D.|S.P.D.]] B-Squad Green Ranger Detective Lina Song, the Mighty Morphin Yellow Ranger Aisha and the RPM Ranger Operator Series Gold Gem. After the allies get caught up on the Hyperforce Rangers' exploits with \"The Leader\" and Vesper's current situation with being stuck inside Alpha 55, the group goes over the plan to stop \"The Alliance\" from altering history by using a hologram to trick \"The Leader\" into being blown up with explosives. Gem reveals that he has set up more explosives around the perimeter of the United Alliance of Evil meeting place as a backup plan while he builds additional explosives for the group to use. Andros decides to continue on as if he were still on his original mission to rescue Zordon while the Hyperforce Rangers go about their plans to stop \"The Leader\". Vesper puts Alpha 55 on speaker so that the rest of the group can hear him and prepares the hologram of Marv while the group teleports to the dinner meeting. As they prepare to make their move the Hyperforce Rangers notice multiple time ships appearing in the sky. At first the Hyperforce Rangers are confused, but come to an educated conclusion that these time ships are likely the ones stolen by \"The Alliance\" and not additional reinforcements from Time Force. The Hyperforce Rangers recognize \"The Leader\" as he approaches Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd. \"The Leader\" reveals his true identity to Rita and Zedd as their son [[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Thrax]]. Before the Hyperforce Rangers can react to Thrax, Dark Specter appears. Dark Specter reveals to the United Alliance of Evil that he has Zordon prisoner and is draining him of his energy. Andros attempts to distract Thrax by trying to throw his hood over his head, but is grabbed by Thrax instead. Thrax impertinently proclaims his superiority to the crowd of villains at being the ultimate evil while the Hyperforce Rangers set off the perimeter explosives as a distraction and Chloe transforms into her Pink Battle Warrior form. Joe strikes Thrax in the back causing him to drop Andros. Merlin suggests to Marv that this might be the perfect time to launch the Marv hologram. Vesper grows increasingly annoyed at being referred to as Alpha 55, but eventually complies by launching the Marv hologram. Eddie and Jack reach Zordon and try to explain the situation with time being altered while trying to save him. Jack tells Vesper to quit wasting time by asking for wishes from Zordon and to scan him for making a potential Zordon hologram to use in the future. As one of the stolen time ships gets close to Zordon, members of \"The Alliance\" launch themselves toward Zordon. \"Vespa\" has Alpha 55's chest lower and blast one of \"The Alliance\" members sending him hurling off into space. Eddie and Chloe successively combine their power to freeze the lava draining Zordon's power. Jack attempts to expel the lava elsewhere, but fails. Chloe has Jack launch her in the air and she uses her Hyperion Bow to take out the remaining members of \"The Alliance\" coming towards Zordon. Zordon lends a little of his strength to Eddie to power up his Oceanus Trident. Gem and Goldar clash in a head on head battle, but Gem is dazed as he is knocked to the ground. Aisha tries to distract Goldar with a dance as Andros uses his Galaxy Glider to strike Goldar. Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd discuss Thrax's potential to succeed and replace Dark Specter. Divatox and Elgar take cover under one of the tables as the various factions of the United Alliance of Evil are left confused in the chaos of the various attacks. Merlin lends his power to Marv to make the Marv hologram look more spectacular and distract Thrax. Annoyed, Thrax begins to drain the crowd of villains of their energy; killing Elgar, the Machine Empire's Royal House of Gadgetry and groups of Quantrons in the process. As Goldar is distracted by the Marv hologram Andros, Gem and Aisha do a combined pincer attack on board the Galaxy Glider to knock Goldar unconscious on the ground. Astronema keeps her distance observing the situation as Gem declares his victory over Goldar. Dark Specter confronts \"Vespa\" and Chloe in the middle of a conversation about Vesper missing her head of hair. Vesper remarks that Dark Specter is familiar to their deceased volcanic foe Velchanos. Eddie and Jack try to convince Dark Specter to destroy Thrax. Dark Specter does not trust the Hyperforce Rangers, but agrees that Thrax must be eliminated. As the Marv hologram continues to make a mockery of Thrax's abilities Dark Specter laughs at Thrax. Enraged, Thrax begins to absorb Dark Specter's energy. Marv and Joe attempt to boost Dark Specter's power. Thrax decides he has had enough and launches the full force of the energy back into Dark Specter's chest obliterating him. As Chloe quips about Dark Specter's death in retaliation for being silenced earlier by him Vesper decides to take this inopportune moment to ask why Eddie doesn't look at her in the same romantic way as \"Vespa\" despite wearing her best undergarments to get his attention. One of the stolen time ships swoops in and grabs Zordon with a gigantic claw. the stolen time ship attempts to pull Zordon inside as Eddie, Chloe and \"Vespa\" grab hold of Zordon, but only Chloe manages to maintain hold. The Hyperforce Rangers, Andros, Aisha, Gem, Song and Merlin unleash the full force of their attacks upon Thrax. Thrax attempts to absorb their attack, but becomes overwhelmed by the power. Thrax falls over in a massive explosion, unleashing a wave of dark energy upon Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, strengthening them. Rita and Zedd decide that a direct attack with their new found dark powers may not be wise without a plan and teleport away. The members of \"The Alliance\" on board the stolen time ship shoot Chloe off of Zordon's tube. As Chloe falls she calls upon her Phoenix Hyper Zord and attempts to break the claw holding Zordon, but accidentally knocks Zordon into the stolen time ship instead. Andros, Gem, Aisha, Merlin and Song decide to stay back and hold off the few survivors of the United Alliance of Evil as the Hyperforce Rangers escape to their time ship and chase after Zordon. Aisha thrashes Divatox like a rag doll while Astronema attacks Andros. Joe fails to put a tracker on the stolen time ship with Zordon, but an inner voice speaks to Chloe. Recognizing the voice as the same one who told her to destroy the Corona Aurora, Chloe pinpoints the stolen time ship with Zordon. As the course of time continues to be severely altered from the unfolding events the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship sets chase for Zordon.\n----\nNote: Due to the combined large number of both regular players and guest players featured during this episode not everyone could appear on screen at the same time.

Alpha 55 replies that it will be a few more hours before the body is completed. As the group makes their way into the stolen time ship Chloe inspects each of the rooms. The Hyperforce Rangers find a mysterious man in a lab coat locked behind a force field. As the Hyperforce Rangers free the mysterious man from the force field Chloe recognizes him as her father Mr. Ashford. Mr. Ashford tells Chloe that he had been contacting her through her locket and that he was the voice that she had been hearing in her head. Chloe asks about her mother, but begins to break down when Mr. Ashford tells Chloe that she is dead. Mr. Ashford leads the Hyperforce Rangers to the back of the stolen time ship telling them that Zordon is too powerful to keep at the front of the ship due to the interference with the electronics. As Mr. Ashford continues to talk to the Hyperforce Rangers about Time Force Alpha 55 detects a Time Force energy signal trying to access the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship controls. Mr. Ashford comments under his breath that \"she\" is ahead of schedule and drops a force field in between himself and the Hyperforce Rangers. Mr. Ashford tells the Hyperforce Rangers that there is no use trying to teleport back to their time ship because Scorpina has disabled the controls. Mr. Ashford warns Scorpina by communicator as Vesper downloads her consciousness from Alpha 55 into her partially completed body on board the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship where she regains the memories of her past life and death from her the charred memory chip of her original body. Vesper makes her way to the control room and confronts Scorpina, who has the Time Force Red Ranger Wes hostage. Vesper tries to strangle Scorpina with her own hair, but Scorpina breaks free by cutting off her own hair with her nails. Mr. Ashford threatens to destroy the remaining Time Force Rangers unless he gets some alone time with Chloe. The Hyperforce Rangers come to the conclusion that if Chloe complies with his demand it may prove to be distraction enough to save the Time Force Rangers from their captivity. As Chloe transforms into her Pink Battle Warrior form Alpha 55 pilots the Phoenix Hyper Zord and takes Marv, Joe, Jack and Eddie to each of the other stolen time ships with Time Force signatures. Eddie enters one of the stolen time ships. On board Eddie quickly disarms and tosses a member of \"The Alliance\" into a room, locking him inside by barring the now broken door knob with the member's own weapon. Before Eddie can free the prisoner he becomes trapped in an illusion of a deserted island with Vesper. Realizing this can't be real, Eddie body slams the illusion of Vesper and begins to follow the voice of the prisoner he hears as the island begins to flood. Jack enters another one of the stolen time ships and is injured by Goldar, who has now joined \"The Alliance\" on their mission. Jack damages Goldar's wing with his Crius Cannon as Goldar in turn jabs Jack in the shoulder. Jack blasts the access panel allowing the Time Force Yellow Ranger Katie to bust through the door of her prison cell. Annoyed that Goldar has interrupted her conversation with Jack, Katie punches Goldar upside the face. On another stolen time ship Marv and Joe break down a door finding Doomstone trying to revive Thrax back to life. Combining their attack, Doomstone is knocked to the ground and the Time Force Blue Ranger Lucas is freed. As Joe and Lucas get into it over love interest with Nadira Marv is left uncomfortable and Doomstone takes the opportunity to leave. They then manage to catch up with Doomstone in the control room. Back on board the first stolen time ship Chloe demands answers from her father. Mr. Ashford sidesteps Chloe's questions about her mother, only stating that she fell to her death. Mr. Ashford tells Chloe that he has been planning this for a long time, though some things will need cleaned up as not everything has gone to plan with Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd unexpectedly being powered up by Thrax's death. He then tells Chloe that the stolen time ships are programmed to self destruct if they can't escape through the time stream within ten minutes time. Chloe warns the other Hyperforce Rangers of the self destruct sequence. Back on the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship Scorpina hits Vesper as she fails to back-flip out of the way. Wes morphs and strikes Scorpina with some laser blasts. Vesper drags Scorpina by her leg to the airlock as Burrito the dog bites Scorpina's face. As Vesper continues to hold Scorpina in place Wes stomps her in the stomach. Wes gets tired of Vesper's antics with Scorpina and jettisons Scorpina from the airlock into an unknown point in the time stream. Back in the illusion, Eddie uses his Zordon enhanced Oceanus Trident to dispel the illusion and accidentally hits the Time Force Green Ranger Trip. Lokar uses his mental powers to mess with Trip and Eddie's minds by making a hole appear. Eddie uses his Oceanus Trident to dispel the illusion yet again. Eddie uses hologram technology enhanced by Trip's psychic powers to make a team of Time Force and Hyperforce Rangers with Eddie's face to distract Lokar. As the back of the stolen time ship opens up revealing Lokar, the holograms begin to malfunction and shrink. The shrinking holograms and Eddie lunge at Lokar. Eddie strikes Lokar causing him to disappear in the time stream in an explosion of black feathers. Eddie and Trip make their way to the control center and recover Trip's morpher. As the stolen time ship becomes unstable and starts to crash Alpha 55 picks the pair up. Trip is marveled by the fact that his design of the Phoenix Hyper Zord is now a reality. Back on board one of the other stolen time ships Jack hits Goldar in the face and Katie hits him in the abdomen. Katie catches and snaps Goldar's sword in two with her super strength. Jack uses the Crius Hammer to smack Goldar unconscious while ripping off his remaining wing. As Katie busts through multiple walls to claim her morpher Jack decides to ask her out for coffee. Alpha 55 picks up the pair of Yellow Rangers before the stolen time ship crashes. On another stolen time ship Marv drills through Doomstone's eye and body reclaiming Lucas's morpher from the control panel. As the time ship crashes the group of three runs to escape with Lucas and Joe both trying to \"accidentally\" leave the other behind. On board the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship and the Phoenix Hyper Zord the group of Rangers makes their way back to save Chloe from the remaining stolen time ship. Chloe becomes enraged at Mr. Ashford's responses and a whirlwind begins to threaten the destruction of the stolen time ship. Chloe begins to calm herself, still feeling her mother's presence and starts to notice little tells that her father may not have been entirely truthful with her. As Mr. Ashford teleports away Chloe attacks the force field and is knocked unconscious. As the Hyperforce Rangers enter stolen time ship and save Chloe, Eddie revives her with the healing charge technology. As the group enters the Hyperforce Rangers' time ship the remaining stolen time ships not destroyed disappear into the time stream. The group of Rangers decide that the best course of action is to go back to the year 3017, but before they can do that they will have to first pick up their other allies. The Hyperforce Rangers are unable to contact or locate Andros, but they manage to get hold of Aisha. Aisha begs for the Hyperforce Rangers to send her back to an earlier time before the dinner party took place from which she can warn Zordon, but the Time Force Rangers disagree stating that doing so would not solve problem currently at hand because time travel doesn't work that way. Alpha 55 teleports Merlin, Aisha, Song and Gem on board and the Time Force Rangers forcefully wipes their memories, despite much protest from the allies, in an attempt to best preserve what remains of the original timeline before returning them home. Seeing the technology to wipe minds at work Vesper begs the Time Force Rangers to use it on her, anguished by seeing and feeling the memories of herself burn to death on and endless loop in her mind. Trip tells her that it is impossible because her mind doesn't work like an organic mind, but perhaps one day remembering her experience would help her grow as a person. Vesper tells Eddie to find and erase every last back-up copy she has made of herself because if she were ever to die again she would prefer to remain dead instead of coming back even worse off than she is now. As Trip looks through the history records he concludes that the United Alliance of Evil dinner took place eight months before Zordon's death, meaning they have eight months to make things right before the time alterations become permanent. As their allies are dropped off one by one in their respective times and dimensions, the Hyperforce Rangers discover that Song has disappeared from the time ship. The Time Force Rangers and Hyperforce Rangers search the entire time ship, but are unable to locate her. Chloe decides to go off to be by herself for a while to think about things with her father. Back in the year 3017 the group finds three giant sculptures of Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd and Thrax. The group is confronted and shot at by an alternate timeline version of Jen Scotts from \"The Resistance\". As Lucas inquires about the alternate Nadira of this timeline, they learn from alternate Jen that \"The Resistance\" wants to bring about the downfall of Lady Nadira. The Time Force Rangers decide to stay in the 3017 to help \"The Resistance\" and Marv gives them a communicator to stay in touch. As the Hyperforce Rangers board the time ship they say their goodbyes as Trip hugs Joe and Katie kisses Jack on the cheek while pushing Marv five feet away for his \"friend zone\" comment. Back at the palace on the moon in the year 1998 the dark powered enhanced Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa return home. Fueled by the dark energy of Thrax's anger and the knowledge of their future fate to become good should Zordon die the two tear the palace apart. Rita says that they should have Goldar clean up the mess, but after Zedd informs Rita that Goldar never came back home, the two decide that they can make a new and better Goldar with their enhanced powers. Rita and Zedd then begin to plot their path to victory.\n----\nNotes: 1. Zac Eubank appears in this episode as a guest [[cooperative board game|Co-Op]] [[gamemaster|Game Master]] and acts similar to a guest player (with access to Supers, Megas and Ultras) while portraying multiple characters. Those characters include: Wes Collins, the [[Power Rangers Time Force|Time Force]] Red Ranger; Trip Regis, the Time Force Green Ranger; Katie Walker, the Time Force Yellow Ranger; and Lucas Kendall, the Time Force Blue Ranger.\n\n2. Due to his guest [[cooperative board game|Co-Op]] [[gamemaster|Game Master]] status Zac Eubank also has several [[non-player character|NPC]] cameo appearances throughout this episode portraying multiple characters. Those characters include: Lord Zedd; Mr. Ashford (aka Chloe's father and the mysterious man in a lab coat); Gem, the [[Power Rangers RPM|RPM]] Ranger Operator Series Gold; Aisha Campbell, the [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Mighty Morphin]] Yellow Ranger; [[Merlin]], the wizard; Jen Scotts of \"The Resistance\", the alternate timeline version of the Time Force Pink Ranger; and Lokar's illusion of Vesper Leigh Vasquez, the Hyperforce Black Ranger.\n\n3. The [[Rita Repulsa]] [[cosplay]] worn by Malika Lim during this episode was created by Stella Chuu.\n}}\n{{Episode List|List of Power Rangers Hyperforce episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = Special\n |Title = Power Rangers Villains\n |Aux1 = [[Mike Ginn]] as [[Power Rangers RPM|Unnamed Attack Bot #6 (dumbbell-themed Attack Bot)]] aka \"Dumbbot\"<br/>Malika Lim as [[Power Rangers in Space|Waspicable]]<br/>Cameron Rice as [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Robogoat]] and [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Eye Guy]]<br/>Melissa Flores as [[Power Rangers Dino Charge|Poisandra]]<br/>Jason Bischoff as [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Psycho Green]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|03|25}}\n | ShortSummary= Many of the villains of the Power Rangers throughout the multiverse receive a letter with a dinner invitation to meet at Lord Zedd's palace on the moon. After some brief and yet crude introductions that make Poisandra blush, the villains partake in some food. The villains then come under attack from Gem, the RPM Ranger Operator Series Gold. The previously unnamed dumbbell-themed Attack Bot from ''RPM'', now referring to himself as \"Dumbbot\", immediately beats Gem to death until he is a fine paste and Robogoat decides to wear the Ranger outfit. Impressed by the ability of \"Dumbbot\" to kill a Ranger, Poisandra forces Psycho Green to wear a tuxedo and marry her to \"Dumbbot\". Goldar then reveals that he is the one who sent out the invitations to all the villains. Goldar reveals to all the other villains that they weren't invited to join either \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" or the forces of Lord Drakkon in destroying the Power Rangers. Now Goldar wants the villains to prove that they are indeed strong enough to defeat the Power Rangers and they decide to film themselves at the gym destroying Putties dressed as Rangers. \"Dumbbot\" makes an offhand comment about Rita Repulsa that gets him struck by a bolt of lightning. A short time later \"Dumbbot\" has his arms randomly fall off. Poisandra decides to keep one of the arms and his other arm is reattached backward and severely melted. Waspicable decides to show everyone how evil she is by growing big and smacking all the villains to various locations throughout space, time and other dimensions. Goldar tells Waspicable that none of it was recorded. Robogoat goes swimming on Aquatar and Psycho Green ends up in the Dark Dimension. Poisandra runs into Thrax, who is looking for his parents in Angel Grove in 1994 and she bludgeons him to death with the arm from \"Dumbbot\". \"Dumbbot\" is on a planet of gold in the Lion's Head Galaxy. The Alien Rangers of Aquatar throw Robogoat back to the moon and his muscles are now ripped from the swimming. Psycho Green returns to the moon and randomly brings back \"Dumbbot\", Poisandra and Grace Sterling, the Mighty Morphin Red Ranger from 1969. Several of the villains decide to show off to Grace Sterling by playing basketball. Grace Sterling ends up up-showing and injuring Robogoat. Waspicable spins the basketball on her stinger and \"Dumbbot\" ends up hitting himself upside the head with the ball. [[Breaking the fourth wall|Mike Ginn]] randomly appears in the gym with dumbbells for arms and is decapitated by Poisandra. \"Dumbbot\" blocks Grace Sterling's attack and she seems to disintegrate after Psycho Green attacks her. \"Dumbbot\" claim's Mike Ginn's head as a trophy but fails to record another Ranger being destroyed. General Venjix and the Venjix virus show up and both are attacked by \"Dumbbot\" and Robogoat. \"Dumbbot\" use Mike Ginn's head to attack General Venjix as Dr. Tommy Oliver appears in the arena. As Dr. Oliver attempts to morph into Dino Thunder Black Ranger he is stopped in mid-morph after being suplexed from the pocket dimension by Robogoat. \"Dumbbot\" decides to teabag Dr. Oliver as he lays on the floor partially morphed and is punched in the nards by Dr. Oliver. Sledge appears and teams up with Psycho Green. To avoid Poisandra Sledge challenges all the villains to a dance battle. Robogoat reaches into the pocket dimension and uses the Dragon Dagger to summon Dragonzord to throw Dr. Oliver into orbit while joining in on the dance off. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson appears to join the dance off and Goldar beheads him. Ziggy, the RPM Ranger Operator Series Green then appears and joins the dance. \"Dumbbot\" beats up Ziggy and Poisandra throws Ziggy and Sledge together as she calls down Sledge's Ship and releases all the bounty monsters on board the ship. Goldar's armor starts to fall off revealing that he is really Zac Eubank in disguise. Robogoat decides to rummage through all of Dr. Oliver's closets in the Dragonzord and finds each of his Ranger costumes along with the \"[[Dear John letter|Dear John]]\" letter Kimberly gave him. Robogoat then destroys all the bounty monsters from Sledge's ship with Dragonzord's missiles. \"Dumbbot\" beats Ziggy to death as Koda, the Dino Charge Blue Ranger appears. Koda tries to eat a shrunk Waspicable and spits the monster to the ground. Poisandra steals Koda's Energem. Robogoat has Dragonzord throw Koda against the wall killing him. Zac Eubank tries to keep the villains from also killing him by telling them he was recording them to give the villains better press. So Waspicable shoots Dragonzord and it falls onto Sledge's ship killing Rito Revolto, General Venjix and the Venjix virus. \"Dumbbot\" tries to grow and instead swells up and falls over teabagging Zac Eubank to death. Poisandra attacks a grown Psycho Green with the Energem enhanced arm of \"Dumbbot\" as Robogoat appeals to Waspicable with some balloons. Vesper, the Hyperforce Black Ranger then appears and attacks Robogoat for trying to say he is Doggie Cruger because she believes that Cruger is a jerk. Vesper then uses the Energem from Poisandra to become a half Blue and Black Ranger and comments on it being like being merged with Eddie, the Hyperforce Blue Ranger. \"Dumbbot\" has his muscles explode and is reduced to a weakling. Vesper rips off Robogoat's arm and beats him with it. Robogoat tries to pull Alpha 5 from the pocket dimension, but fails and is forced to slap Vesper. Robogoat tries to hide by dressing up in the Goldar armor that was left behind. Psycho Green smashes Robogoat until Robogoat and the Goldar armor fuse together. Poisandra runs off to hide in Lord Zedd's palace. Robogoat prays to a goat god to grows a new arm. Robogoat then flies away with the Goldar wings to go get a chocolate shake and joins the police to become [[RoboCop|RobogoatCop]]. Rita Repulsa goes to the arena to yell at the deceased Zac for all the damage to the arena. \"Dumbbot\" tries to convince Vesper to leave him alone, but Mike Ginn's head reveals that \"Dumbbot\" is a villain. Vesper injures \"Dumbbot\" as Eye Guy randomly appears. Vesper blows a bunch of dust into Eye Guy's eyes and Waspicable makes it worse trying to clean the dust away. Eye Guy sprouts some wings and flies away to join the hamburger franchise [[Five Guys]] so that the place can be now known as Five Eye Guys. Vesper shrinks and Rita Repulsa randomly blows up. Lord Zedd sends Psycho Green to pick up the food from Five Eye Guys for a commercial shoot. \"Dumbbot\" steps on Vesper, killing her. \"Dumbbot\" then restores Mike Ginn back to life and they revive Zac Eubank back to life for the sole purpose of killing him again. The Wizard of Deception turns the arena into a curvy road covered in rain as Lord Zedd takes the food. Chloe Ashford, the Hyperforce Pink Ranger appears with a burrito and has a conversation with Waspicable. Louie Kaboom randomly appears from a portal and stands over in a corner as Chloe and the villains decide they want to act in the commercial. Poisandra has taken over Lord Zedd's palace on the moon as no one remains in the palace to challenge her as the ruler of the moon. Mike Ginn follows the Wizard of Deception's advice and falls into a portal that causes him to drift off lifelessly into space. Louie Kaboom explodes killing everyone in the arena except for the Wizard of Deception who floats away with an SD card. The Wizard of Deception takes the SD card to Eye Five Guys and watches the footage as Eye Guy gives the Wizard of Deception a gift card.\n----\nNotes: 1. Zac Eubank once again reprises his role as a guest [[gamemaster|Game Master]] due to Malika Lim once again taking on a guest player role during this special episode.\n\n2. This special is a bonus episode made beyond the original 25 episodes that were scheduled. The special episode aired on a special day as part of Hyper RPG's HyperDrive; a monthly day long fundraiser event designed to help raise funds for the company's daily expenses. Due to this the episode isn't labelled under the ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' show title as the rest of the season. Also due to being part of the HyperDrive, after the live airing the special remained a [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] exclusive that can only be re-watched if caught during rerun while Hyper RPG isn't airing live or through a paid subscription to Hyper RPG's channel. Since the special won't be uploaded to [[YouTube]] like the normal episodes it doesn't have an episode title in the same way as the rest of the ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' episodes do. As such, the episode title listed for this special comes from what the special was listed as on Hyper RPG's HyperDrive schedule when it originally aired live.\n\n3. Unlike the main episodes for ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'', this special featured a slightly different [[Tabletop role-playing game|Tabletop RPG]] system and interactive Twitch participation component during the live-stream that favored more spontaneity. The special was also less reliant on planned scenarios to guide the special's narrative unlike the main episodes. As such, the story and [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] was much more chaotic and random, similar to what one might expect from an [[improvisational comedy]] or [[sketch comedy]] show like ''[[Kwik Witz]]'' or ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''. Due to these factors, this special is considered to be in its own continuity separate of ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'', the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' TV show multiverse and the ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (comics)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' comics multiverse despite drawing inspiration from all three sources. Although not considered in continuity with anything else in the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, the special is still none the less considered a canon product to ''[[Power Rangers]]'' in the sense that Saban Brands approved of the special being made.\n\n4. Because this special episode focuses mostly on the perspective of the random villains and monsters of the day, the cast of this special is entirely guest players. The new guest players are Cameron Rice, Melissa Flores and Jason Bischoff. Cameron Rice is a Writer for ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' and Hyper RPG. Melissa Flores is the Director for ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' and ''Power Rangers'' Content for Saban Brands. Jason Bischoff is the Director of Global Consumer Products for ''Power Rangers'' and Saban Brands. The returning guest players, Mike Ginn and Malika Lim, are playing new characters from their previous guest player appearances.\n\n5. This special was made before it was officially established in ''Power Rangers Hyperforce'' that Thrax and \"The Leader\" of \"The Alliance\" were one in the same. Because of this they are treated as two completely separate individuals in regards to this special.\n\n6. This special did not have a ''Fireside Chat'' due to being part of Hyper RPG's HyperDrive.\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n== Hyper RPG ==\nHyper RPG (Hyper Rabbit Power Go) is an entertainment channel that streams live tabletop games, reviews and talk shows every weekday on Twitch.

(Accessed December 2010.)</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAll single malt goes through a similar [[batch production]] process, as outlined below. There are several types of single malts available from distilleries including single barrel single malts which are the product of a single batch that was stored for three or more years in a single oak barrel.  These single barrel variants afford the opportunity for the consumer to see the influence of different types of storage on the same whisky (e.g., first use [[bourbon whiskey]] barrels, port pipes, etc.).  The more common form of Single Malt is a marrying at bottling time of various batches that are mixed or vatted to achieve consistent flavours from one bottling run to the next.\n\n===Water===\nWater is first added to the barley to promote [[germination]].  At a later stage, prior to fermentation, it is mixed with ground barley grist to create a mash. Water is also used later in the production process to dilute most whisky before maturation and added once again before bottling.\n\nMost new-make malt whisky is diluted to about 60% alcohol by volume (ABV) or so before it is placed in casks to mature (62.5% is specified as a maximum in U.S. law for making [[straight whisky]]). The aged spirit is then diluted with water to reduce it to bottling strength (typically 40-50% ABV). Since large amounts of water are used during the process of whisky production, water supplies are a key factor for the location of any distillery.\n\n===Malting===\n[[File:Highland park malting floor.jpg|thumb|Malting floor at [[Highland Park Distillery]].]]\n[[Image:Sjb whiskey malt.jpg|right|thumb|Malted barley.]]\nBarley, [[yeast]] and [[water]] are the only ingredients required in the production of (barley-based) single malt whisky.\n\nThe barley used to make the whisky is \"malted\" by soaking the grain in water for two to three days and allowing it to germinate. This process releases enzymes, which convert unfermentable starch (which is insoluble in water and not available for fermentation by yeast) to fermentable sugars.\n\nTraditionally in Scotland, each distillery had its own malting floor where the germinating seeds were regularly turned. The \"pagoda roof\" (many now false) which ventilated the malt kiln can still be seen at many distilleries both in Scotland and in other countries. However, most of the distilleries now use commercial \"maltsters\" to prepare their malt.\n\n===Drying in the kiln===\nThe germination is halted (by heating) after three to five days, when the optimum amount of starch has been converted to fermentable sugars. The method for drying the germinated barley is by heating it with hot air.\n[[Image:Sjb whiskey kiln.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The distinctive \"pagoda\" chimney of a kiln at a distillery in Scotland.]]\n\nIn most cases, some level of smoke from a [[peat]]-heated fire is introduced to the [[kiln]] to add [[phenols]], a smoky aroma and flavour to the whisky. Some of the more intensely smoky malts have phenol levels between 25 and 50 parts per million (ppm).\n[[Islay]] malts have a reputation for being the peatiest.\nMore subtle malts can have phenol levels of around 2&ndash;3&nbsp;ppm.\nEntirely non-smoked (non-peated, unpeated) malts are made by the [[Glengoyne Distillery]], which only uses hot air for drying.\n\n===Mashing===\nThe malt is milled into a coarse flour (''grist'') which is made of three substances: (1) Husks (70%); (2) Grits (20%); and Flour (10%); to which three courses of hot water are added to extract the sugars.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe extraction is done in a large kettle (usually made of stainless steel) called a ''mash tun''. At first, the hot water [[solvation|dissolves]] the sugars (maltose) and enzymes (diastase) in the grist. Then the enzymes act on the starch left over from the malting stage, continuing the conversion to sugar, and producing a sugary liquid called ''[[wort (brewing)|wort]]''. Typically, each batch of grist is mashed three times or so to extract all the fermentable sugars.  The first water is injected at approximately 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, the second portion at approximately 72&nbsp;\u00b0C and the third and final portion at approximately 88&nbsp;\u00b0C.  The wort from the first two water courses is drained into \"washback\" vessels for further processing, whereas the third course is retained as the first charge in the next batch.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Fermentation===\n[[Image:Sjb whiskey wash.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yeast]] is used to ferment [[malt]]ed [[barley]] in ''washbacks''.]]\n[[Yeast]] is added to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of thousands of litres{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}) called a ''washback''. Washbacks are commonly made of [[douglas-fir|Oregon Pine]] or stainless steel.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]]. This process is called [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as [[Wash (distilling)|wash]]. Up until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of [[beer]].\n\n===Distillation===\n[[Image:Sjb whiskey still.jpg|left|thumb|The ''wash'', 5%\u20137% [[ethanol]], is distilled in [[copper]] [[pot still]]s, boosting the alcohol content to 60%&ndash;80%.]]\nThe wash is then [[distillation|distilled]]. The wash is heated, boiling off the alcohol, which has a lower [[boiling point]] than water; the vapour is collected and cooled to condense it back into a liquid form.\n\nScottish regulations require single malts to be distilled in [[pot still]]s. In other jurisdictions, [[column still]]s may be used.\n\nThe initial distilled spirit produced by a pot still, known as ''low wine'' has an alcohol content of about 20 to 40%. The low wines are then pumped into a second still, known as the ''spirit still'', and distilled a second (and sometimes a third) time. The final spirit, called \"new make spirit\", generally has an alcohol content of 60 to 70%.\n\n===Dilution prior to aging===\nMost new-make malt whisky is diluted to about 62.5% a.b.v. before it is placed in casks to mature.\n\n===Maturation===\nThe \"new-make spirit\", or unaged whisky, is then placed in oak [[cask]]s to mature. By law, all [[Scotch whisky]] must be aged for a minimum of three years in oak casks, though many single malts are matured for much longer. The whisky continues to develop and change as it spends time in the wood, and maturation periods of twenty years or more are not uncommon. During the time it spends in the wood, a significant percentage of each cask's content will evaporate. The lost product is known as the [[angel's share]].\n\n====Reused casks====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe selection of casks can affect the character of the final whisky. Outside of the United States, the most common practice is to reuse casks that previously contained [[American whiskey]], as US law requires several types of distilled spirits to be aged in new oak casks. To ensure continuity of supply of used oak casks some Scottish distilling groups own oak forests in the US and rent the new barrels to bourbon producers for first fill use. Bourbon casks impart a characteristic vanilla flavour to the whisky.\n\n[[Sherry]] casks are also commonly used. This practice arose because sherry used to be shipped to Britain from Spain in the cask rather than having been bottled, and the casks were expensive to return empty and were unwanted by the sherry cellars. In addition to imparting the flavours of their former contents, sherry casks lend maturing spirit a heavier body and a deep amber and sometimes reddish colour.\n\nStainless steel shipping containers, however, have reduced the supply of wooden sherry casks, to the extent that the [[Macallan Single Malt|Macallan]] Distillery builds casks and leases them to the sherry cellars in [[Spain]] for a time, then has them shipped back to [[Scotland]].\n\nOther casks used include those that formerly held [[port wine]], [[madeira wine|madeira]], [[rum]] or [[Cognac (drink)|cognac]].\n\n===Vatting, dilution and bottling===\nTo be called a single malt whisky in Scotland, a bottle may only contain whisky distilled from malted barley and produced at a single distillery. The regulations of other countries may allow malted rye.\n\nIf the bottle is the product of malt whiskies produced at more than one distillery, the whisky is called a [[Blended malt whisky|blended malt]] or vatted malt, or pure malt. If a single malt is mixed with [[grain whisky]], the result is a [[blended whisky]]. Single malts can be bottled by the distillery that produced them or by an [[independent bottler]].\n\nThe age statement on a bottle of single malt whisky is the age of the youngest malt in the mix, as commonly the whiskies of several years are mixed in a vat to create a more consistent house style. On occasion, the product of a single cask of whisky is bottled without being vatted with other casks, and released as a \"[[Single barrel whiskey|Single Cask]]\" offering. However, it is not always clear what the term \"single cask\" refers to. At least some producers release vattings of multiple barrels that have been matured together for one final period in a larger single cask as \"single cask\" whisky.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glendronach Confusion (or What is a \"Single Cask\"?)|url=http://www.myannoyingopinions.com/2014/02/14/glendronach-confusion-single-cask/|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[Cask strength|cask-strength]], or undiluted, whisky (sometimes having an alcohol content upwards of 60%) has recently become popular, the vast majority of whisky is diluted to its \"bottling strength\" - between 40% and 46% ABV - and bottled for sale.\n\n===Chill filtration===\nWhisky can be \"[[chill filtering|chill filtered]]\": chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as ''unchillfiltered'' or ''non chill filtered''. Unchillfiltered whisky will often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal. Unchillfiltered, cask-strength whisky is generally regarded as whisky in its ''purest form''.\n\nUnlike [[wine]], whisky does not continue to mature in the bottle.\n\n===Additives===\n[[Caramel color|E150A caramel colouring]] may be added to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling,<ref name = Caramel2/><ref name = Caramel/> to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance. No other additives are allowed in Scotch whisky. This contrasts with the rules governing [[Canadian whisky]] production, which allows the addition of other flavourings as well as caramel, and with the rules governing [[American whiskey]], which do not allow additives in \"straight\" whisky. The use of the caramel additive must be disclosed when the whisky is sold in some jurisdictions, although not in Scotland itself.<ref name = Caramel2>[http://www.whiskymag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=627 Caramel (E150) or not], ''Whisky'' Magazine forum. (Accessed January 2011.)</ref><ref name = Caramel>[http://www.whiskymag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3557 Caramel coloring discussion], ''Whisky'' Magazine forum. (Accessed January 2011.)</ref>\n\n==History==\nDistillation of whisky has been performed in Scotland and Ireland for centuries.  The first written record of whisky comes from Ireland in 1405 in the Irish ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'', where it was written that the head of a clan died after \u201ctaking a surfeit of [[aqua vitae]]\u201d at Christmas.  The production of whisky from malted barley is first mentioned in Scotland in an entry on the 1494 Exchequer Rolls:  \"Eight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor, by order of the King, wherewith to make '[[aqua vitae]]'\".<ref>Kosar, Kevin R. (2010). ''Whiskey: A Global History''. London: Reaktion Books. {{ISBN|1-86189-780-4}}</ref>\n\nSingle malt whisky is associated with the Scottish tradition, although there are also [[List_of_whisky_brands#Irish_single_malts|Irish single malts]] and others. [[Penderyn (whisky)|Penderyn]], the only whisky commercially produced in Wales, is also a single malt.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, whisky was heavily taxed in Scotland, to the point that most of the spirit was produced illegally. However, in 1823, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed an act making commercial distillation much more profitable, while imposing punishments on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. [[George Smith (distiller)|George Smith]] was the first person to take out a licence for a distillery under the new law, founding the [[Glenlivet Single Malt|Glenlivet Distillery]] in 1824.\n\nIn the 1830s, [[Aeneas Coffey]] refined a design originally created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the ''grain whisky'' distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market. In recent times, single malt has made up about 26% of the whisky exported to other countries from Scotland; bulk spirits constituted about 5% and the balance has been blended whisky.<ref>[https://bespokeunit.com/whisky/history/ A Comprehensive Yet Concise History of Scotch Whisky]</ref>\n\nSingle malt distilleries also exist in Argentina,<ref>http://whiskeyreviewer.com/2014/01/la-alazana-distillery-set-to-release-whiskey-in-2014_010214/</ref> Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Lebanon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://athyrwhisky.com/|title=The first ever Lebanese single malt whisky|last=Whisky|first=Athyr Single Malt|website=Athyr Single Malt Whisky|language=en-AE|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, USA, Wales and Norway. <ref name = Murray>Murray, Jim (2012).

In addition to imparting the flavours of their former contents, sherry casks lend maturing spirit a heavier body and a deep amber and sometimes reddish colour.\n\nStainless steel shipping containers, however, have reduced the supply of wooden sherry casks, to the extent that the [[Macallan Single Malt|Macallan]] Distillery builds casks and leases them to the sherry cellars in [[Spain]] for a time, then has them shipped back to [[Scotland]].\n\nOther casks used include those that formerly held [[port wine]], [[madeira wine|madeira]], [[rum]] or [[Cognac (drink)|cognac]].\n\n===Vatting, dilution and bottling===\nTo be called a single malt whisky in Scotland, a bottle may only contain whisky distilled from malted barley and produced at a single distillery. The regulations of other countries may allow malted rye.\n\nIf the bottle is the product of malt whiskies produced at more than one distillery, the whisky is called a [[Blended malt whisky|blended malt]] or vatted malt, or pure malt. If a single malt is mixed with [[grain whisky]], the result is a [[blended whisky]]. Single malts can be bottled by the distillery that produced them or by an [[independent bottler]].\n\nThe age statement on a bottle of single malt whisky is the age of the youngest malt in the mix, as commonly the whiskies of several years are mixed in a vat to create a more consistent house style. On occasion, the product of a single cask of whisky is bottled without being vatted with other casks, and released as a \"[[Single barrel whiskey|Single Cask]]\" offering. However, it is not always clear what the term \"single cask\" refers to. At least some producers release vattings of multiple barrels that have been matured together for one final period in a larger single cask as \"single cask\" whisky.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glendronach Confusion (or What is a \"Single Cask\"?)|url=http://www.myannoyingopinions.com/2014/02/14/glendronach-confusion-single-cask/|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[Cask strength|cask-strength]], or undiluted, whisky (sometimes having an alcohol content upwards of 60%) has recently become popular, the vast majority of whisky is diluted to its \"bottling strength\" - between 40% and 46% ABV - and bottled for sale.\n\n===Chill filtration===\nWhisky can be \"[[chill filtering|chill filtered]]\": chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as ''unchillfiltered'' or ''non chill filtered''. Unchillfiltered whisky will often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal. Unchillfiltered, cask-strength whisky is generally regarded as whisky in its ''purest form''.\n\nUnlike [[wine]], whisky does not continue to mature in the bottle.\n\n===Additives===\n[[Caramel color|E150A caramel colouring]] may be added to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling,<ref name = Caramel2/><ref name = Caramel/> to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance. No other additives are allowed in Scotch whisky. This contrasts with the rules governing [[Canadian whisky]] production, which allow the addition of other flavourings as well as caramel, and with the rules governing [[American whiskey]], which do not allow additives in \"straight\" whisky. The use of the caramel additive must be disclosed when the whisky is sold in some jurisdictions, although not in Scotland itself.<ref name = Caramel2>[http://www.whiskymag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=627 Caramel (E150) or not], ''Whisky'' Magazine forum.

The first written record of whisky comes from Ireland in 1405 in the Irish ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'', where it was written that the head of a clan died after \u201ctaking a surfeit of [[aqua vitae]]\u201d at Christmas.  The production of whisky from malted barley is first mentioned in Scotland in an entry on the 1494 Exchequer Rolls:  \"Eight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor, by order of the King, wherewith to make '[[aqua vitae]]'\".<ref>Kosar, Kevin R. (2010). ''Whiskey: A Global History''. London: Reaktion Books. {{ISBN|1-86189-780-4}}</ref>\n\nSingle malt whisky is associated with the Scottish tradition, although there are also [[List_of_whisky_brands#Irish_single_malts|Irish single malts]] and others. [[Penderyn (whisky)|Penderyn]], the only whisky commercially produced in Wales, is also a single malt.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, whisky was heavily taxed in Scotland, to the point that most of the spirit was produced illegally. However, in 1823, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed an act making commercial distillation much more profitable, while imposing punishments on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. [[George Smith (distiller)|George Smith]] was the first person to take out a licence for a distillery under the new law, founding the [[Glenlivet Single Malt|Glenlivet Distillery]] in 1824.\n\nIn the 1830s, [[Aeneas Coffey]] refined a design originally created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the ''grain whisky'' distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market. In recent times, single malt has made up about 26% of the whisky exported to other countries from Scotland; bulk spirits constituted about 5% and the balance has been blended whisky.<ref>[https://bespokeunit.com/whisky/history/ A Comprehensive Yet Concise History of Scotch Whisky]</ref>\n\nSingle malt distilleries also exist in Argentina,<ref>http://whiskeyreviewer.com/2014/01/la-alazana-distillery-set-to-release-whiskey-in-2014_010214/</ref> Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Lebanon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://athyrwhisky.com/|title=The first ever Lebanese single malt whisky|last=Whisky|first=Athyr Single Malt|website=Athyr Single Malt Whisky|language=en-AE|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, USA, Wales and Norway. <ref name = Murray>Murray, Jim (2012).
