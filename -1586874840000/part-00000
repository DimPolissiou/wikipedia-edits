The tunnel carries the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] (serving the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}}) under the [[East River]] in New York City, connecting the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] station in Brooklyn and the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nTwo options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a [[14th Street busway]] would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie|time=nolink}} and people living along or near [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced.<ref name=\"L Project\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canarsie (8168179049).jpg|thumb|Damaged tunnels after draining]]\nIn October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused [[Hurricane Sandy in New York|severe damage to New York City]], and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the [[IND Rockaway Line|Rockaway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Rockaway}}) in [[Queens]], as well as much of the [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] terminal at [[Manhattan]]'s southern tip.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed repairs, which were staggered over several years starting in 2013. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boissoneault |first1=Lorraine |title=Superstorm Sandy Anniversary \u2013 How the Subway Survived |url=http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/devastating-effects-water-how-superstorm-sandy-shut-down-subway-swamped-city |website=The Weather Channel |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}</ref>  Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the [[IND Crosstown Line|Greenpoint Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}), [[Montague Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Fourth Montague header}}), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station.

The other option would allow the MTA to operate two segments of track for three years: a [[Single-track railway|single-track]] segment between Bedford and Eighth Avenues with a capacity of 5 trains per hour per direction, and regular service between Lorimer Street and Rockaway Parkway. For both options, the [[Third Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Third Avenue]] station would be closed and new exits and elevators at the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] and Bedford Avenue stations would be added.

The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence.

The tunnel carries the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] (serving the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}}) under the [[East River]] in New York City, connecting the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] station in Brooklyn and the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nTwo options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a [[14th Street busway]] would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie|time=nolink}} and people living along or near [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced.<ref name=\"L Project\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canarsie (8168179049).jpg|thumb|Damaged tunnels after draining]]\nIn October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused [[Hurricane Sandy in New York|severe damage to New York City]], and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the [[IND Rockaway Line|Rockaway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Rockaway}}) in [[Queens]], as well as much of the [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] terminal at [[Manhattan]]'s southern tip.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed repairs, which were staggered over several years starting in 2013. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boissoneault |first1=Lorraine |title=Superstorm Sandy Anniversary \u2013 How the Subway Survived |url=http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/devastating-effects-water-how-superstorm-sandy-shut-down-subway-swamped-city |website=The Weather Channel |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}</ref>  Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the [[IND Crosstown Line|Greenpoint Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}), [[Montague Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Fourth Montague header}}), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station.

The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence. The tracks within the tunnels were also be replaced.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\" /> These repairs would be able to last up to eighty years.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nFollowing the January 2019 announcement that the shutdown would instead be a partial closure, Cuomo and the MTA board unveiled some new details about the project.
