Formation of the [[European Union]] (EU) and in 1999, the introduction of a unified currency \u2013 the [[euro]] brings participating European countries closer through the convenience of a shared currency and has led to a stronger European cash flow. The difference in wealth across Europe can be seen roughly in former Cold War divide, with some countries breaching the divide ([[Greece]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]). Whilst most European states have a [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] higher than the world's average and are [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very highly developed]] ([[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Andorra]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]]), some European economies, despite their position over the world's average in the [[Human Development Index]], are poorer.\n\nThroughout this article \"Europe\" and derivatives of the word are taken to include selected states whose territory is only partly in Europe \u2013 such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia, \u2013 and states that are geographically in Asia, bordering Europe and culturally adherent to the continent \u2013 such as Armenia, and Cyprus.\n\nEurope in 2018 had a nominal GDP of $23&nbsp;trillion<ref name=\"imf\">[https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/index.aspx]. Last accessed April 2019.</ref> (1/4 of the world).  Europe's largest national economies with GDP (nominal) of more than $1 trillion are:\n*[[Germany]] (about $10.9 trillion), \n*[[United Kingdom]] (about $2.8 trillion),\n*[[France]] (about $2.8 trillion), \n*[[Italy]] (about $2.0 trillion), \n*[[Russia]] (about $1.6 trillion), \n*[[Spain]] (about $1.4 trillion),\n\nOther large European economies are that of [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], [[Austria]], [[Ireland]] and [[Denmark]]. [[European Union]] (about $16 trillion GDP) generates about 4/5 of [[Europe]]'s GDP.\n\nThe EU as a whole is the second wealthiest and second largest economy in the world, below the US by about $5 trillion.\n\nOf the top 500 largest corporations measured by revenue ([[Fortune Global 500]] in 2010), 184 have their headquarters in Europe. 161 are located in the EU, 15 in Switzerland, 6 in Russia, 1 in Turkey, 1 in Norway.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2010/countries/Australia.html|title=Global 500 2010: Countries \u2013 Australia|work=Fortune|accessdate=8 July 2010}} Number of companies data taken from the \"Pick a country\" box.</ref>\n\nAs noted in 2010 by the Spanish sociologist [[Manuel Castells]], the average standard of living in [[Western Europe]] is very high: \"The bulk of the population in Western Europe still enjoys the highest living standards in the world, and in the world's history.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wDLJAGDRGYC&pg=PA69 |title=End of Millennium|isbn=9781444323443|last1=Castells|first1=Manuel|date=26 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Economic development ==\n{{Main|Economic history of Europe}}\n\n=== Pre\u20131945: Industrial growth ===\nPrior to [[World War II]], Europe's major financial and industrial states were the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain, had spread rapidly across Europe, and before long the entire continent was at a high level of industry. World War I had briefly led to the industries of some European states stalling, but in the run-up to World War II Europe had recovered well, and was competing with the ever-increasing economic might of the United States of America.\n\nHowever, World War II caused the destruction of most of Europe's industrial centres, and much of the continent's infrastructure was laid to waste.\n\n=== 1945\u20131992: The Cold War era ===\nFollowing World War II, European governments were in tatters.\nMany non-Socialist European governments moved to link their economies, laying the foundation for what would become the [[European Union]]. This meant a huge increase in shared infrastructure and cross-border trade. Whilst these European states rapidly improved their economies, by the 1980s, the economy of the [[COMECON]] was struggling, mainly due to the massive cost of the [[Cold War]]. The GDP and the living standards of Central and Eastern European states were lower than in other parts of Europe.\n\nThe European Community grew from 6 original members following World War II, to 12 in this period.\n\nAverage living standards in Europe rose significantly during the post-war period, as characterised by these findings:<ref>Responses to poverty: lessons from Europe by Robert Walker, Roger Lawson, and Peter Townsend</ref>\n\n'''Per capita private consumption (PPSs) in 1980'''\n\n* Luxembourg: 5495\n* France: 5395\n* Germany, Federal Republic: 5319\n* Belgium: 5143\n* Denmark: 4802\n* Netherlands: 4792\n* United Kingdom: 4343\n* Italy: 4288\n* Ireland: 3029\n\n'''Per capita personal disposable income (PPSs) in 1980'''\n\n* Belgium: 6202\n* France: 6044\n* Germany, Federal Republic: 5661\n* Netherlands: 5490\n* Italy: 5378\n* Denmark: 4878\n* United Kingdom (UK): 4698\n\n=== Rise of the European Union ===\nWhen the '[[Eastern Bloc]]' dissolved around 1992, these states struggled to adapt to free-market systems. There was, however, a huge variation in degrees of success, with Central European states such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland adapting reasonably quickly, whilst states that used to form the [[USSR]] such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine struggled to reform their crumbling infrastructures.\n\nMany developed European countries were quick to develop economic ties with fellow European states, where democracy was reintroduced. After the Revolutions of 1989, states in Central Europe and the [[Baltic states]] dealt with change, former Yugoslavian republics descended into war and Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are still struggling with their old systems.\n\nEurope's largest economy, Germany, struggled upon unification in 1991 with former communist [[German Democratic Republic]], or [[East Germany]], influenced by the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[GDR]] had much of its industrial infrastructure removed during the Cold War, and for many years unified Germany struggled to build infrastructure in the former East Germany up to the level of former West Germany.\n\nPeace did not come to Yugoslavia for a decade, and by 2003, there were still many [[NATO]] and EU peacekeeping troops present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Kosovo{{ref label|status|a|}} . War severely hampered economic growth, with only Slovenia making any real progress in the 1990s.\n\nThe European economy was affected by the [[September 11 Attacks]] in the United States in 2001, with Germany, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom being the worst hit. But, in 2002/2003, the economy began to recover from the attacks in US.\n\nThe economy of Europe was by this time dominated by the EU, a huge economic and political organization with then 15 of Europe's states as full members. EU membership was seen as something to aspire to, and the EU gave significant support and aid to those Central and Eastern European states willing to work towards achieving economies that met the entry criteria. During this time, 12 of the 15 members of the EU became part of the [[Eurozone]], a [[currency union]] launched in 1999, whereby each member uses a shared currency, the euro, which replaced their former national currencies. Three states chose to remain outside the Eurozone and continue with their own currencies, namely Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\n=== 2004\u20132007: EU expansion ===\nIn early 2004, 10 mostly former communist states joined the EU in its biggest ever [[Enlargement of the European Union|expansion]], enlarging the union to 25 members, with another eight making associated trade agreements. The acceding countries are bound to join the Eurozone and adopt the common currency euro in the future. The process includes the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], of which some of these countries are already part.\n\nMost European economies are in very good shape, and the continental economy reflects this. Conflict and unrest in some of the former Yugoslavia states and in the [[Caucasus]] states are hampering economic growth in those states, however.\n\nIn response to the massive EU growth, in 2005 the Russian-dominated [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) created a rival trade bloc to the EU, open to any previous USSR state, (including both the European and Asian states).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nuriyev|first=Elkhan|date=2015|title=Russia, the EU and the South Caucasus: Forging an Efficient Over-Arching Cooperative Regional Security Scheme|journal=Connections|volume=14|issue=2|pages=51\u201364|issn=1812-1098|jstor=26326397|doi=10.11610/Connections.14.2.04|doi-access=free}}</ref> 12 of the 15 signed up, with the three [[Baltic states]] deciding to align themselves with the EU.

In 2011, [[Estonia]] became the first republic from the former [[Soviet Union]] to adopt the euro, followed by [[Latvia]] in 2014, and [[Lithuania]] in 2015. Recently, [[Croatia]] became the 28th member of the European Union, which had entered on the 1st day of July 2013.\n\nIn 2008, the Global Financial Crisis, triggered by the housing bubble in the United States, caused a significant decline in the GDP of the majority of the European economies, which was a precedent to a far broader and more problematic [[Eurozone debt crisis]], which threatened the collapse of economies in the south, particularly [[Greece]], [[Italy]] recently affected by the ongoing political crisis, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. Having also been hit hard, [[Ireland]] exited the crisis in mid-2013. Meanwhile, increased bailouts of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[European Central Bank]] alleviated somehow the situation in the debt-stricken nations, with Central and East European economies led by [[Economy of Germany|Germany]] escaping the worst of the 2010s debt crisis.\n\nBy the mid 2010s, 2014\u20132015, Ireland was recovering at a steady pace having graduated from the bail out programme successfully. The Eurozone as a whole had become more stable, however problems in Greece and slow recovery in Italy and in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) continue in keeping growth in the Euro area to a minimum. Germany continues to lead Europe in stability and growth, while both the UK and Ireland are seeing strong growth of 3\u20134%. Unemployment in Ireland reducing at the fastest levels in Europe, expected to reach 8% by 2016, down from double that in 2011. The Czech Republic and Germany have constantly the lowest unemployment rate in the EU.<ref name=\"eurostatunemp16\">{{cite web|title=Unemployment statistics|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics#Recent_developments_in_unemployment_at_a_European_and_Member_State_level|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> Growth outlook in general remains optimistic for Europe in the future. With positive growth expected across the Euro area. Although uncertainty still surrounds Greece and debt payments in the Greek state, at present things appear stable.\n\nEuropean businesses have been in decline against worldwide ones since the crisis. Of the 50 most valuable global firms, only seven were European as of 2015, compared to 17 in 2006. Out of 24 economic sectors, Europe only leads in one - food, which is led by [[Nestl\u00e9]] from Switzerland. Companies like [[HSBC]], [[Vodafone]], [[Total S.A.|Total]] and [[BNP Paribas]] have all also sled in their respective industries against American and Asian competitors. In addition, former technologic heavyweights like [[Nokia]], [[Ericsson]] and [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] have also declined against evolving American companies in the [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21701480-why-european-companies-have-become-fading-force-global-business-clout-rout|title=From clout to rout|author=|date=30 June 2016|journal=The Economist|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Regional variation ==\n{{Update section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:European countries by total wealth(billions USD), Credit Suisse 2018.png|thumb|350px|European countries by [[Distribution of wealth in Europe|total wealth]] (billions USD), Credit Suisse 2018]]\nEuropean countries with a long history of trade, a free market system, and a high level of development in the previous century are generally in the north and west of the continent. They tend to be wealthier and more stable than countries congregated in the European East and South, even though the gap is converging, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, due to higher growth rates.\n\nThe poorest states are those that just emerged from communism, fascist dictatorships and civil wars, namely those of the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], excluding [[Slovenia]]. Former [[Western Bloc]] itself presents some living standards and development differences, with the greatest contrast seen between [[Scandinavia]] (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland) and Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.\n\n{{Main|List of sovereign states in Europe by GNI (nominal) per capita}}\nBelow is a map of European countries by [[gross national income]] per capita.<ref>GNI (nominal) per capita 2012, World Development Indicators database [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD/countries], World Bank, revised 12 Aug 2013, Atlas method</ref> [[High income economy|High income]] in blue ($12,616 or more, as defined by the [[World Bank]]), upper middle income in green ($4,086 \u2013 $12,615) and lower middle income ($1,036 \u2013 $4,085) in yellow.\n\n=== European Union ===\n{{Main|Economy of the European Union}}\nThe European Union has the largest economy in the world. Trade within the Union accounts for more than one-third of the world total.\n\nThe [[European Union]] or EU is a [[supranational union]] of {{EUnum}} European states, the most recent acceding member being Croatia, which became full member on 1 July 2013. It has many functions, the most important being the establishment and maintenance of a common single market, consisting of a customs union, a [[Euro|single currency]] (adopted by 18 of the {{EUnum}} member states<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/money/euro/index_en.htm|title=EUROPA \u2013 The euro|work=europa.eu|date=5 July 2016}}</ref>), a [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and a Common Fisheries Policy. The European Union also undertakes various initiatives to co-ordinate activities of the member states.\n\nThe union has evolved over time from a primarily economic union to an increasingly political one. This trend is highlighted by the increasing number of policy areas that fall within EU competence: political power has tended to shift upwards from the Member States to the EU.\n\n=== European Free Trade Association ===\nThe [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) was established on 3 May 1960 as an alternative for European states that did not wish to join the European Union, creating a [[trade bloc]] with fewer central powers.\n\nThe EFTA member states as of 1992 were Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In 2014 only four countries, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, remained members of EFTA, as the other members have gradually left to join the EU.\n\n=== European Economic Area ===\nThe [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) came into being on 1 January 1994 following an agreement between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). It was designed to enable EFTA countries to participate in the European [[Single Market]] without having to join the EU.\n\nIn a referendum, Switzerland (ever keen on neutrality) chose not to participate in the EEA (although it is linked to the European Union by bilateral agreements similar in content to the EEA agreement), so the current members are the '''EU states''' plus '''Norway''', '''Iceland''' and '''Liechtenstein'''.\n\nA Joint Committee consisting of the non EU members plus the [[European Commission]] (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant EU Law to the non EU members.\n\n=== Commonwealth of Independent States ===\nThe [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a [[confederation]] consisting of 9 of the 15 states of the former Soviet Union, (the exceptions being the three [[Baltic states]], Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine (Turkmenistan and Ukraine are participating states in the CIS)). Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization and possesses co-ordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. The most significant issue for the CIS is the establishment of a full-fledged free trade zone / economic union between the member states, to be launched in 2005. It has also promoted co-operation on democratization and cross-border crime prevention.\n\n=== Central European Free Trade Agreement ===\nThe [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) is a [[trade bloc]] of: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on behalf of Kosovo.\n\n== Currency and central banks ==\n{{update-section|date=January 2020}}\nThe most common currency within Europe is the [[Euro]] (\u20ac), the currency of the European Union. To join, each new EU member must meet certain criteria, when these are met their own currencies will be replaced by the euro. Becoming a member of the EU involves a pledge to work towards [[Eurozone]] membership, (except in the case of Denmark, which has opt-outs). Currently, 19 of the 27 EU member states use the euro. Each EU member's [[central bank]] is part of the [[European System of Central Banks]], and in addition, those that use the euro are part of the European Union's central bank, the [[European Central Bank]].\n\nThere are some non-EU members who have elected to use the euro as their national currency like [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]], either with or without specific agreements with the EU to do so, (those with agreements with the EU may mint their own [[euro coins]]). The French overseas territories and departments of Mayotte and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean and French Guiana in South America all use the euro, among many other islands in the Pacific, Caribbean and indeed around the globe that are ruled directly by European countries.\n\nSome countries while maintaining their own national currency have pegged its value to the euro.  In some of these countries, there is a fixed exchange rate between the national currency and the euro and in this case the currency is actually a submultiple of the euro. In other countries, the national currency's value fluctuates within a band (generally 15%) around a set rate. Currencies pegged to the euro include the currencies of Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cape Verde. Denmark has a foreign exchange band tied to the euro.\n\nThe CIS is also planning to introduce a single currency among its members.\n\nBelow is a '''list of the central banks and currencies of Europe'' as of 1 May 2010.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!Country !!

The process of improving Central Europe's agriculture is ongoing and is helped by the accession of Central European states to the EU. The agricultural sector in Europe is helped by the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP), which provides farmers with a minimal price for their products and subsidizes their exports, which increases competitiveness for their products. This policy is highly controversial as it hampers [[free trade]] worldwide ([[protectionism]] sparks protectionism from other countries and trade blocs: the concept of [[trade war]]s) and is violating the concept of ''fair trade''.\n\nThis means because of the protectionist nature of the CAP, agricultural products from [[developing country|developing countries]] are rendered incompetitive in both Europe (an important export market for developing countries) and on their home markets (as European agricultural products are [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumped]] on developing countries' markets with help from European [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]). This controversy surrounds every system of agricultural subsidies (the United States' policy of subsidizing farmers is also controversial). The CAP is also controversial because 40% of the EU's budget is spent on it, and because of the [[overproduction]] caused by it.\n\nThe [[Common Fisheries Policy]] is surrounded by an extensive system of rules (mainly consisting of [[Individual Fishing Quota|quotas]]) to protect the environment from [[overfishing]]. Despite these rules, the [[cod]] is becoming increasingly rare in the [[North Sea]] resulting in drastic shortages in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. Strict fishing rules are the main reason for Norway and Iceland to stay out of the European Union (and out of the Common Fisheries Policy). Price guarantees and subsidizations of fishermen are implemented in the same way as agricultural subsidies are. Bluefin tuna is also a problem. Global stocks of the species are overfished with extinction in the wild a possibility in the near future. This also has the negative effect of threatening their traditional, natural predators.\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nEurope has a thriving manufacturing sector, with a large part of the world's industrial production taking place in Europe. Most of the continent's industries are concentrated in the '[[Blue Banana]]' (covering Southern [[England]], the [[Benelux]], western Germany, eastern France, Switzerland, and northern Italy). However, because of the higher wage level and hence production costs, Europe is suffering from [[deindustrialization]] and [[offshoring]] in the labour-intensive manufacturing sectors. This means that manufacturing has become less important and that jobs are moved to regions with cheaper labour costs (mainly China and Central and Eastern Europe).\n\nCentral Europe (Berlin, Saxony, the Czech Republic and Little Poland) was largely industrialised by 1850 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbbnet.umn.edu/scmap/industrymap.html|title=Industrialization Map - 1850|author=|date=|website=mbbnet.umn.edu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> but Eastern Europe (European Russia) begun industrialisation between 1890\u20131900 and intensified it during the communist regime (as the USSR), but it suffered from contraction in the 1990s when the inefficient heavy-industry-based manufacturing sector was crippled after the collapse of communism and the introduction of the market economy.\n\nIn the 21st century the manufacturing sector in Central and Eastern Europe picked up because of the accession of ten formerly Communist European states to the EU and their resulting accession to the European Common Market. This caused firms within the European Union to move jobs from their manufacturing sector to Central European countries such as Poland (see above), which sparked both Central and Eastern European industrial growth and employment.\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]], 195 of the top 500 companies are headquartered in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reports-and-materials.org/Ruggie-survey-Govts-and-Fortune-500.pdf|title=PDF-Human Rights Policies and Management Practices: Results from questionnaire surveys of Governments and Fortune Global 500 firms|accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref> The main products in European industry are automobiles, bicycles, rail, machinery, marine, aerospace equipment, food, chemical and pharmaceutical goods, software and electronics.\n\n=== Investing and banking ===\nEurope has a well-developed [[financial sector]].

UK-located banks underwrite around half of the debt and equity issued by EU companies.

As many as 30 million EEA policyholders are insured through a UK-based insurer. Central counterparties (CCPs) located in the United Kingdom provide services to EU clients in a range of markets.  UK-located asset managers account for 37% of all assets managed in Europe.}}</ref> The financial sector of the [[Eurozone]] is helped by the introduction of the euro as common currency. This has made it easier for European households and firms to invest in companies and deposit money in banks in other European countries. Exchange rate fluctuations are now non-existent in the Eurozone. The financial sector in Central and Eastern Europe is helped by economic growth in the region, [[European Regional Development Fund]] and the commitment of Central and Eastern European governments to achieve high standards.\n\nAccording to the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], {{asof|2019|September|19|lc=y}}, four European cities rank among the 20 largest financial centres in the world: London (2nd), Zurich (14th), Frankfurt (15th), and Paris (17th).<ref name=GFCI>{{cite web|url=https://www.zyen.com/media/documents/GFCI_26_Report_v1.0.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 26|date=September 2019|publisher=Long Finance|accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nEuropean banks are amongst the largest and most profitable in the world, such as [[Barclays]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Cr\u00e9dit Agricole]], [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[UBS]], [[HSBC]], [[Grupo Santander]], [[BBVA]], [[HBOS]], and [[UniCredit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankersalmanac.com/addcon/infobank/bank-rankings.aspx |title=Bank List \u2013 Top Banks in the World |publisher=Bankersalmanac.com |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in Europe}}\n\n'''Transport in Europe''' provides for the movement needs of over 700 million people<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp |title=World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision |date=11 March 2009 |publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] |accessdate=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012190153/http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp |archivedate=12 October 2009 }}</ref> and associated freight. The political geography of Europe divides the continent into over 50 sovereign states and territories. This fragmentation, along with increased movement of people since the [[industrial revolution]], has led to a high level of cooperation between European countries in developing and maintaining transport networks. [[Supranational union|Supranational]] and intergovernmental organisations such as the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] have led to the development of international standards and agreements that allow people and freight to cross the borders of Europe, largely with unique levels of freedom and ease.\n\n==== Rail transport ====\n{{Main|Rail transport in Europe}}\n\nRail networks in Western and Central Europe are often well maintained and well developed, whilst Eastern, Northern and Southern Europe often have less coverage and/or infrastructure problems. Electrified railway networks operate at a plethora of different voltages AC and DC varying from 750 to 25,000 volts, and signalling systems vary from country to country, hindering cross-border traffic. EU rail subsidies amounted to \u20ac73 billion in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_3/download |title=EU Technical Report 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Air transport ====\nDespite an extensive road and rail network, most long distance travel within Europe is by air. A large tourism industry also attracts many visitors to Europe, most of whom arrive into one of Europe's many large international airports.  London is the second busiest airport in the world by number of international passengers, only trailing Dubai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/aviation/worlds-busiest-airports/index.html|title=World's busiest airports announced|author=|date=4 April 2016|website=cnn.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> The advent of [[low cost carriers]] in recent years has led to a large increase in air travel within Europe.

Formation of the [[European Union]] (EU) and in 1999, the introduction of a unified currency \u2013 the [[euro]] brings participating European countries closer through the convenience of a shared currency and has led to a stronger European cash flow. The difference in wealth across Europe can be seen roughly in former Cold War divide, with some countries breaching the divide ([[Greece]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]). Whilst most European states have a [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] higher than the world's average and are [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very highly developed]] ([[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Andorra]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]]), some European economies, despite their position over the world's average in the [[Human Development Index]], are poorer.\n\nThroughout this article \"Europe\" and derivatives of the word are taken to include selected states whose territory is only partly in Europe \u2013 such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia, \u2013 and states that are geographically in Asia, bordering Europe and culturally adherent to the continent \u2013 such as Armenia, and Cyprus.\n\nEurope in 2018 had a nominal GDP of $23&nbsp;trillion<ref name=\"imf\">[https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/index.aspx].

The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain, had spread rapidly across Europe, and before long the entire continent was at a high level of industry. World War I had briefly led to the industries of some European states stalling, but in the run-up to World War II Europe had recovered well, and was competing with the ever-increasing economic might of the United States of America.\n\nHowever, World War II caused the destruction of most of Europe's industrial centres, and much of the continent's infrastructure was laid to waste.\n\n=== 1945\u20131992: The Cold War era ===\nFollowing World War II, European governments were in tatters.\nMany non-Socialist European governments moved to link their economies, laying the foundation for what would become the [[European Union]]. This meant a huge increase in shared infrastructure and cross-border trade. Whilst these European states rapidly improved their economies, by the 1980s, the economy of the [[COMECON]] was struggling, mainly due to the massive cost of the [[Cold War]]. The GDP and the living standards of Central and Eastern European states were lower than in other parts of Europe.\n\nThe European Community grew from 6 original members following World War II, to 12 in this period.\n\nAverage living standards in Europe rose significantly during the post-war period, as characterised by these findings:<ref>Responses to poverty: lessons from Europe by Robert Walker, Roger Lawson, and Peter Townsend</ref>\n\n'''Per capita private consumption (PPSs) in 1980'''\n\n* Luxembourg: 5495\n* France: 5395\n* Germany, Federal Republic: 5319\n* Belgium: 5143\n* Denmark: 4802\n* Netherlands: 4792\n* United Kingdom: 4343\n* Italy: 4288\n* Ireland: 3029\n\n'''Per capita personal disposable income (PPSs) in 1980'''\n\n* Belgium: 6202\n* France: 6044\n* Germany, Federal Republic: 5661\n* Netherlands: 5490\n* Italy: 5378\n* Denmark: 4878\n* United Kingdom (UK): 4698\n\n=== Rise of the European Union ===\nWhen the '[[Eastern Bloc]]' dissolved around 1992, these states struggled to adapt to free-market systems. There was, however, a huge variation in degrees of success, with Central European states such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland adapting reasonably quickly, whilst states that used to form the [[USSR]] such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine struggled to reform their crumbling infrastructures.\n\nMany developed European countries were quick to develop economic ties with fellow European states, where democracy was reintroduced. After the Revolutions of 1989, states in Central Europe and the [[Baltic states]] dealt with change, former Yugoslavian republics descended into war and Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are still struggling with their old systems.\n\nEurope's largest economy, Germany, struggled upon unification in 1991 with former communist [[German Democratic Republic]], or [[East Germany]], influenced by the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[GDR]] had much of its industrial infrastructure removed during the Cold War, and for many years unified Germany struggled to build infrastructure in the former East Germany up to the level of former West Germany.\n\nPeace did not come to Yugoslavia for a decade, and by 2003, there were still many [[NATO]] and EU peacekeeping troops present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Kosovo{{ref label|status|a|}} . War severely hampered economic growth, with only Slovenia making any real progress in the 1990s.\n\nThe European economy was affected by the [[September 11 Attacks]] in the United States in 2001, with Germany, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom being the worst hit. But, in 2002/2003, the economy began to recover from the attacks in US.\n\nThe economy of Europe was by this time dominated by the EU, a huge economic and political organization with then 15 of Europe's states as full members. EU membership was seen as something to aspire to, and the EU gave significant support and aid to those Central and Eastern European states willing to work towards achieving economies that met the entry criteria. During this time, 12 of the 15 members of the EU became part of the [[Eurozone]], a [[currency union]] launched in 1999, whereby each member uses a shared currency, the euro, which replaced their former national currencies. Three states chose to remain outside the Eurozone and continue with their own currencies, namely Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\n=== 2004\u20132007: EU expansion ===\nIn early 2004, 10 mostly former communist states joined the EU in its biggest ever [[Enlargement of the European Union|expansion]], enlarging the union to 25 members, with another eight making associated trade agreements. The acceding countries are bound to join the Eurozone and adopt the common currency euro in the future. The process includes the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], of which some of these countries are already part.\n\nMost European economies are in very good shape, and the continental economy reflects this. Conflict and unrest in some of the former Yugoslavia states and in the [[Caucasus]] states are hampering economic growth in those states, however.\n\nIn response to the massive EU growth, in 2005 the Russian-dominated [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) created a rival trade bloc to the EU, open to any previous USSR state, (including both the European and Asian states).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nuriyev|first=Elkhan|date=2015|title=Russia, the EU and the South Caucasus: Forging an Efficient Over-Arching Cooperative Regional Security Scheme|journal=Connections|volume=14|issue=2|pages=51\u201364|issn=1812-1098|jstor=26326397|doi=10.11610/Connections.14.2.04|doi-access=free}}</ref> 12 of the 15 signed up, with the three [[Baltic states]] deciding to align themselves with the EU.

In 2011, [[Estonia]] became the first republic from the former [[Soviet Union]] to adopt the euro, followed by [[Latvia]] in 2014, and [[Lithuania]] in 2015. Recently, [[Croatia]] became the 28th member of the European Union, which had entered on the 1st day of July 2013.\n\nIn 2008, the Global Financial Crisis, triggered by the housing bubble in the United States, caused a significant decline in the GDP of the majority of the European economies, which was a precedent to a far broader and more problematic [[Eurozone debt crisis]], which threatened the collapse of economies in the south, particularly [[Greece]], [[Italy]] recently affected by the ongoing political crisis, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. Having also been hit hard, [[Ireland]] exited the crisis in mid-2013. Meanwhile, increased bailouts of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[European Central Bank]] alleviated somehow the situation in the debt-stricken nations, with Central and East European economies led by [[Economy of Germany|Germany]] escaping the worst of the 2010s debt crisis.\n\nBy the mid 2010s, 2014\u20132015, Ireland was recovering at a steady pace having graduated from the bail out programme successfully. The Eurozone as a whole had become more stable, however problems in Greece and slow recovery in Italy and in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) continue in keeping growth in the Euro area to a minimum. Germany continues to lead Europe in stability and growth, while both the UK and Ireland are seeing strong growth of 3\u20134%. Unemployment in Ireland reducing at the fastest levels in Europe, expected to reach 8% by 2016, down from double that in 2011. The Czech Republic and Germany have constantly the lowest unemployment rate in the EU.<ref name=\"eurostatunemp16\">{{cite web|title=Unemployment statistics|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics#Recent_developments_in_unemployment_at_a_European_and_Member_State_level|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> Growth outlook in general remains optimistic for Europe in the future. With positive growth expected across the Euro area. Although uncertainty still surrounds Greece and debt payments in the Greek state, at present things appear stable.\n\nEuropean businesses have been in decline against worldwide ones since the crisis. Of the 50 most valuable global firms, only seven were European as of 2015, compared to 17 in 2006. Out of 24 economic sectors, Europe only leads in one - food, which is led by [[Nestl\u00e9]] from Switzerland. Companies like [[HSBC]], [[Vodafone]], [[Total S.A.|Total]] and [[BNP Paribas]] have all also sled in their respective industries against American and Asian competitors. In addition, former technologic heavyweights like [[Nokia]], [[Ericsson]] and [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] have also declined against evolving American companies in the [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21701480-why-european-companies-have-become-fading-force-global-business-clout-rout|title=From clout to rout|author=|date=30 June 2016|journal=The Economist|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Regional variation ==\n{{Update section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:European countries by total wealth(billions USD), Credit Suisse 2018.png|thumb|350px|European countries by [[Distribution of wealth in Europe|total wealth]] (billions USD), Credit Suisse 2018]]\nEuropean countries with a long history of trade, a free market system, and a high level of development in the previous century are generally in the north and west of the continent. They tend to be wealthier and more stable than countries congregated in the European East and South, even though the gap is converging, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, due to higher growth rates.\n\nThe poorest states are those that just emerged from communism, fascist dictatorships and civil wars, namely those of the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], excluding [[Slovenia]]. Former [[Western Bloc]] itself presents some living standards and development differences, with the greatest contrast seen between [[Scandinavia]] (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland) and Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.\n\n{{Main|List of sovereign states in Europe by GNI (nominal) per capita}}\nBelow is a map of European countries by [[gross national income]] per capita.<ref>GNI (nominal) per capita 2012, World Development Indicators database [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD/countries], World Bank, revised 12 Aug 2013, Atlas method</ref> [[High income economy|High income]] in blue ($12,616 or more, as defined by the [[World Bank]]), upper middle income in green ($4,086 \u2013 $12,615) and lower middle income ($1,036 \u2013 $4,085) in yellow.\n\n=== European Union ===\n{{Main|Economy of the European Union}}\nThe European Union has the largest economy in the world. Trade within the Union accounts for more than one-third of the world total.\n\nThe [[European Union]] or EU is a [[supranational union]] of {{EUnum}} European states, the most recent acceding member being Croatia, which became full member on 1 July 2013. It has many functions, the most important being the establishment and maintenance of a common single market, consisting of a customs union, a [[Euro|single currency]] (adopted by 18 of the {{EUnum}} member states<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/money/euro/index_en.htm|title=EUROPA \u2013 The euro|work=europa.eu|date=5 July 2016}}</ref>), a [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and a Common Fisheries Policy. The European Union also undertakes various initiatives to co-ordinate activities of the member states.\n\nThe union has evolved over time from a primarily economic union to an increasingly political one. This trend is highlighted by the increasing number of policy areas that fall within EU competence: political power has tended to shift upwards from the Member States to the EU.\n\n=== European Free Trade Association ===\nThe [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) was established on 3 May 1960 as an alternative for European states that did not wish to join the European Union, creating a [[trade bloc]] with fewer central powers.\n\nThe EFTA member states as of 1992 were Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In 2014 only four countries, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, remained members of EFTA, as the other members have gradually left to join the EU.\n\n=== European Economic Area ===\nThe [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) came into being on 1 January 1994 following an agreement between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). It was designed to enable EFTA countries to participate in the European [[Single Market]] without having to join the EU.\n\nIn a referendum, Switzerland (ever keen on neutrality) chose not to participate in the EEA (although it is linked to the European Union by bilateral agreements similar in content to the EEA agreement), so the current members are the '''EU states''' plus '''Norway''', '''Iceland''' and '''Liechtenstein'''.\n\nA Joint Committee consisting of the non EU members plus the [[European Commission]] (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant EU Law to the non EU members.\n\n=== Commonwealth of Independent States ===\nThe [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a [[confederation]] consisting of 9 of the 15 states of the former Soviet Union, (the exceptions being the three [[Baltic states]], Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine (Turkmenistan and Ukraine are participating states in the CIS)). Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization and possesses co-ordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. The most significant issue for the CIS is the establishment of a full-fledged free trade zone / economic union between the member states, to be launched in 2005. It has also promoted co-operation on democratization and cross-border crime prevention.\n\n=== Central European Free Trade Agreement ===\nThe [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) is a [[trade bloc]] of: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on behalf of Kosovo.\n\n== Currency and central banks ==\n{{update-section|date=January 2020}}\nThe most common currency within Europe is the [[Euro]] (\u20ac), the currency of the European Union. To join, each new EU member must meet certain criteria, when these are met their own currencies will be replaced by the euro. Becoming a member of the EU involves a pledge to work towards [[Eurozone]] membership, (except in the case of Denmark, which has opt-outs). Currently, 19 of the 27 EU member states use the euro. Each EU member's [[central bank]] is part of the [[European System of Central Banks]], and in addition, those that use the euro are part of the European Union's central bank, the [[European Central Bank]].\n\nThere are some non-EU members who have elected to use the euro as their national currency like [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]], either with or without specific agreements with the EU to do so, (those with agreements with the EU may mint their own [[euro coins]]). The French overseas territories and departments of Mayotte and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean and French Guiana in South America all use the euro, among many other islands in the Pacific, Caribbean and indeed around the globe that are ruled directly by European countries.\n\nSome countries while maintaining their own national currency have pegged its value to the euro.  In some of these countries, there is a fixed exchange rate between the national currency and the euro and in this case the currency is actually a submultiple of the euro. In other countries, the national currency's value fluctuates within a band (generally 15%) around a set rate. Currencies pegged to the euro include the currencies of Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cape Verde. Denmark has a foreign exchange band tied to the euro.\n\nThe CIS is also planning to introduce a single currency among its members.\n\nBelow is a '''list of the central banks and currencies of Europe'' as of 1 May 2010.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!Country !!

The process of improving Central Europe's agriculture is ongoing and is helped by the accession of Central European states to the EU. The agricultural sector in Europe is helped by the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP), which provides farmers with a minimal price for their products and subsidizes their exports, which increases competitiveness for their products. This policy is highly controversial as it hampers [[free trade]] worldwide ([[protectionism]] sparks protectionism from other countries and trade blocs: the concept of [[trade war]]s) and is violating the concept of ''fair trade''.\n\nThis means because of the protectionist nature of the CAP, agricultural products from [[developing country|developing countries]] are rendered incompetitive in both Europe (an important export market for developing countries) and on their home markets (as European agricultural products are [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumped]] on developing countries' markets with help from European [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]). This controversy surrounds every system of agricultural subsidies (the United States' policy of subsidizing farmers is also controversial). The CAP is also controversial because 40% of the EU's budget is spent on it, and because of the [[overproduction]] caused by it.\n\nThe [[Common Fisheries Policy]] is surrounded by an extensive system of rules (mainly consisting of [[Individual Fishing Quota|quotas]]) to protect the environment from [[overfishing]]. Despite these rules, the [[cod]] is becoming increasingly rare in the [[North Sea]] resulting in drastic shortages in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. Strict fishing rules are the main reason for Norway and Iceland to stay out of the European Union (and out of the Common Fisheries Policy). Price guarantees and subsidizations of fishermen are implemented in the same way as agricultural subsidies are. Bluefin tuna is also a problem. Global stocks of the species are overfished with extinction in the wild a possibility in the near future. This also has the negative effect of threatening their traditional, natural predators.\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nEurope has a thriving manufacturing sector, with a large part of the world's industrial production taking place in Europe. Most of the continent's industries are concentrated in the '[[Blue Banana]]' (covering Southern [[England]], the [[Benelux]], western Germany, eastern France, Switzerland, and northern Italy). However, because of the higher wage level and hence production costs, Europe is suffering from [[deindustrialization]] and [[offshoring]] in the labour-intensive manufacturing sectors. This means that manufacturing has become less important and that jobs are moved to regions with cheaper labour costs (mainly China and Central and Eastern Europe).\n\nCentral Europe (Berlin, Saxony, the Czech Republic and Little Poland) was largely industrialised by 1850 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbbnet.umn.edu/scmap/industrymap.html|title=Industrialization Map - 1850|author=|date=|website=mbbnet.umn.edu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> but Eastern Europe (European Russia) begun industrialisation between 1890\u20131900 and intensified it during the communist regime (as the USSR), but it suffered from contraction in the 1990s when the inefficient heavy-industry-based manufacturing sector was crippled after the collapse of communism and the introduction of the market economy.\n\nIn the 21st century the manufacturing sector in Central and Eastern Europe picked up because of the accession of ten formerly Communist European states to the EU and their resulting accession to the European Common Market. This caused firms within the European Union to move jobs from their manufacturing sector to Central European countries such as Poland (see above), which sparked both Central and Eastern European industrial growth and employment.\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]], 195 of the top 500 companies are headquartered in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reports-and-materials.org/Ruggie-survey-Govts-and-Fortune-500.pdf|title=PDF-Human Rights Policies and Management Practices: Results from questionnaire surveys of Governments and Fortune Global 500 firms|accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref> The main products in European industry are automobiles, bicycles, rail, machinery, marine, aerospace equipment, food, chemical and pharmaceutical goods, software and electronics.\n\n=== Investing and banking ===\nEurope has a well-developed [[financial sector]]. Many European cities are [[financial centre]]s with London being the largest.<ref>{{cite web|title=The value of Europe's international financial centres to the EU economy|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Pages/value-europes-international-financial-centres-to-eu.aspx|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=City of London and TheCityUK|author=Europe Economics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525100706/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Pages/value-europes-international-financial-centres-to-eu.aspx|archive-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite paper|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/587384/IPOL_BRI(2016)587384_EN.pdf|title=Brexit: the United-Kingdom and EU financial services|last=|first=|date=9 December 2016|website=|publisher=Economic Governance Support Unit of the European Parliament|access-date=2 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2017/december/approach-to-authorisation-and-supervision-of-international-banks-insurers-central-counterparties|title=The Bank of England's approach to the authorisation and supervision of international banks, insurers and central counterparties|publisher=Bank of England|access-date=2018-03-02|quote=The UK\u2019s financial sector also brings substantial benefits to EU households and firms, allowing them to access a broad range of services efficiently and reliably.

This has made it easier for European households and firms to invest in companies and deposit money in banks in other European countries. Exchange rate fluctuations are now non-existent in the Eurozone.

The political geography of Europe divides the continent into over 50 sovereign states and territories. This fragmentation, along with increased movement of people since the [[industrial revolution]], has led to a high level of cooperation between European countries in developing and maintaining transport networks. [[Supranational union|Supranational]] and intergovernmental organisations such as the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] have led to the development of international standards and agreements that allow people and freight to cross the borders of Europe, largely with unique levels of freedom and ease.\n\n==== Rail transport ====\n{{Main|Rail transport in Europe}}\n\nRail networks in Western and Central Europe are often well maintained and well developed, whilst Eastern, Northern and Southern Europe often have less coverage and/or infrastructure problems. Electrified railway networks operate at a plethora of different voltages AC and DC varying from 750 to 25,000 volts, and signalling systems vary from country to country, hindering cross-border traffic. EU rail subsidies amounted to \u20ac73 billion in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_3/download |title=EU Technical Report 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Air transport ====\nDespite an extensive road and rail network, most long distance travel within Europe is by air. A large tourism industry also attracts many visitors to Europe, most of whom arrive into one of Europe's many large international airports.  London is the second busiest airport in the world by number of international passengers, only trailing Dubai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/aviation/worlds-busiest-airports/index.html|title=World's busiest airports announced|author=|date=4 April 2016|website=cnn.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> The advent of [[low cost carriers]] in recent years has led to a large increase in air travel within Europe. Air transportation is now often the cheapest way of travelling between cities. This increase in air travel has led to problems of airspace overcrowding and environmental concerns. The [[Single European Sky]] is one initiative aimed at solving these problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/ses/public/standard_page/sk_ses.html|title=The Single European Sky|date=13 January 2009|publisher=[[European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation]]|accessdate=18 February 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729121951/www.eurocontrol.int/ses/public/standard_page/sk_ses.html|archive-date=29 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Global trade relations ==\nThe bulk of the EU's external trade is done with China, [[Mercosur]] and the United States,<ref>As regards the EU-China trade relations, see [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=629289 Paolo Farah] (2006) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=916768 Five Years of China's WTO Membership.

Ararat. It is the principal national symbol of Armenia and has been considered a sacred mountain by Armenians.

It is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Armenia]] along with Noah's Ark.\n\n==Political borders==\nMount Ararat forms a near-[[quadripoint]] between [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], [[Iran]], and the Nakhchivan enclave of [[Azerbaijan]]. Its summit is located some {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of both the [[Iran]]ian border and the border of the  [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] exclave of Azerbaijan, and  {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of the Armenian border. The Turkish\u2013Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani and Turkish\u2013Iranian\u2013Azerbaijani [[tripoint]]s are some 8&nbsp;km apart, separated by a narrow strip of Turkish territory containing the [[European route E99|E99]] road which enters Nakhchivan at {{coord|39.6553|N|44.8034|E}}.\n\nFrom the 16th century until 1828 the range was part of the Ottoman-Persian border; Great Ararat's summit and the northern slopes, along with the eastern slopes of Little Ararat were controlled by Persia. Following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u201328)|1826\u201328 Russo-Persian War]] and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], the Persian controlled territory was ceded to the Russian Empire. Little Ararat became the point where the Turkish, Persian, and Russian imperial frontiers converged.<ref name=\"iranicaonline\"/> The current international boundaries were formed throughout the 20th century.

This would in fact point in the direction of a true Ararat elevation around 5125 meter.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ararat 3d version 1.gif|300px|thumb|right|Mount Ararat 3D]]\n\n===Summit ice cap===\nThe [[ice cap]] on the summit of Mount Ararat has been shrinking since at least 1957.

Covering an area of {{convert|1100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is the largest volcanic edifice within the region. Along its northwest\u2013southeast trending long axis, Mount Ararat is about {{convert|45|km|mi|sp=us}} long and is about {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} long along its short axis. It consists of about {{convert|1150|km3|abbr=on}} of [[dacite|dacitic]] and [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] debris and dacitic, rhyolitic, and [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\nMount Ararat consists of two distinct volcanic cones, Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat ([[Little Ararat]]). The western volcanic cone, Greater Ararat, is a steep-sided volcanic cone that is larger and higher than the eastern volcanic cone. Greater Ararat is about {{convert|25|km|mi|sp=us}} wide at the base and rises about {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} above the adjacent floors of the I\u011fdir and Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t basins. The eastern volcanic cone, Lesser Ararat, is {{convert|3896|m|ft|sp=us}} high and {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} across. These volcanic cones, which lie {{convert|13|km|mi|sp=us}} apart, are separated by a wide north\u2013south-trending crack. This crack is the surface expression of an extensional [[Fault (geology)|fault]]. Numerous [[parasitic cone]]s and [[lava dome]]s have been built by flank eruptions along this fault and on the flanks of both of the main volcanic cones.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\nMount Ararat lies within a complex, sinistral [[pull-apart basin]] that originally was a single, continuous depression. The growth of Mount Ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins, the I\u011fdir and Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t basins. This pull-apart basin is the result of [[Strike slip fault|strike-slip]] movement along two en-echelon fault segments, the [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t\u2013G\u00fcrbulak Fault|Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t\u2013G\u00fcrbulak]] and [[I\u011fdir Fault]]s, of a sinistral strike\u2013slip fault system. Tension between these faults not only formed the original pull-apart basin, but created a system of faults, exhibiting a horsetail splay pattern, that control the position of the principal volcanic eruption centers of Mount Ararat and associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones. The strike-slip fault system within which Mount Ararat is located is the result of north\u2013south convergence and [[Tectonism|tectonic]] compression between the Arabian Platform and [[Laurasia]] that continued after the [[Tethys Ocean]] closed during the [[Eocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] along the Bitlis\u2013Zagros [[Suture (geology)|suture]].<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/><ref name=DeweyOther1986a>{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=J.

The closure of these masses of [[continental crust]] collapsed this [[ocean basin]] by middle Eocene and resulted in a progressive shallowing of the remnant seas, until the end of the early Miocene. Post-collisional tectonic convergence within the collision zone resulted in the total elimination of the remaining seas from East Anatolia at the end of early Miocene, crustal shortening and thickening across the collision zone, and uplift of the East Anatolian\u2013Iranian plateau. Accompanying this uplift was extensive deformation by faulting and folding, which resulted in the creation of numerous local basins. The north\u2013south compressional deformation continues today as evidenced by ongoing faulting, volcanism, and seismicity.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/><ref name=DeweyOther1986a/><ref name=KarakhanianOther2004a/>\n\nWithin Anatolia, regional volcanism started in the middle-late Miocene. During the late Miocene\u2013[[Pliocene]] period, widespread volcanism blanketed the entire East Anatolian\u2013Iranian plateau under thick volcanic rocks. This volcanic activity has continued uninterrupted until historical times. Apparently, it reached a climax during the latest Miocene\u2013Pliocene, 6 to 3 Ma. During the [[Quaternary]], the volcanism became restricted to a few local volcanoes such as Mount Ararat. These volcanoes are typically associated with north\u2013south tensional fractures formed by the continuing north\u2013south shortening deformation of Anatolia.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\nIn their detailed study and summary of the Quaternary volcanism of Anatolia, Yilmaz et al. recognized four phases to the construction of Mount Ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into its flanks.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/> First, they recognized a ''fissure eruption phase'' of [[Plinian eruption|Plinian-subPlinian]] [[Fissure vent|fissure eruptions]] that deposited more than {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic [[lava flow]]s. These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest\u2013south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a ''cone-building phase'' began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to {{convert|150|m|ft|sp=us}} thick and [[pyroclastic flow]]s of [[andesite]] and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low conical profile. Third, during a ''climatic phase'', copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a ''flank eruption phase'', during which a major north\u2013south-trending fault offset the two cones that developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano's flanks. Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t plain and along the southerly flowing Sar\u0131su River. These lava flows formed black [[\u02bba\u02bb\u0101]] and [[p\u0101hoehoe]] lava flows that contain well preserved [[lava tube]]s.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/> The [[radiometric dating]] of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma.<ref name=AllenOther2011a>{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Mark B.|last2=Mark|first2=Darren F.|last3=Kheirkhah|first3=Monireh|last4=Barfod|first4=Dan|last5=Emami|first5=Mohammad H.|last6=Saville|first6=Christopher|title=40Ar/39Ar dating of Quaternary lavas in northwest Iran: constraints on the landscape evolution and incision rates of the Turkish\u2013Iranian plateau|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|date=2011|volume=185|issue=3|pages=1175\u20131188|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246x.2011.05022.x|bibcode=2011GeoJI.185.1175A|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13575/1/13575.pdf}}</ref> Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\n===Recent volcanic and seismic activity===\nThe chronology of [[Holocene]] volcanic activity associated with Mount Ararat is documented by either archaeological excavations, oral history, historical records, or a combination of these data, which provide evidence that volcanic eruptions of Mount Ararat occurred in 2500\u20132400 BC, 550 BC, possibly in 1450 AD and 1783 AD, and definitely in 1840 AD.

Ararat. It is the principal national symbol of Armenia and has been considered a sacred mountain by Armenians. It is featured prominently in Armenian literature and art and is an icon for [[United Armenia|Armenian irredentism]]. It is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Armenia]] along with Noah's Ark.\n\n==Political borders==\nMount Ararat forms a near-[[quadripoint]] between [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], [[Iran]], and the Nakhchivan enclave of [[Azerbaijan]]. Its summit is located some {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of both the [[Iran]]ian border and the border of the  [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] exclave of Azerbaijan, and  {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of the Armenian border. The Turkish\u2013Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani and Turkish\u2013Iranian\u2013Azerbaijani [[tripoint]]s are some 8&nbsp;km apart, separated by a narrow strip of Turkish territory containing the [[European route E99|E99]] road which enters Nakhchivan at {{coord|39.6553|N|44.8034|E}}.\n\nFrom the 16th century until 1828 the range was part of the Ottoman-Persian border; Great Ararat's summit and the northern slopes, along with the eastern slopes of Little Ararat were controlled by Persia. Following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u201328)|1826\u201328 Russo-Persian War]] and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], the Persian controlled territory was ceded to the Russian Empire. Little Ararat became the point where the Turkish, Persian, and Russian imperial frontiers converged.<ref name=\"iranicaonline\"/> The current international boundaries were formed throughout the 20th century.

This would in fact point in the direction of a true Ararat elevation around 5125 meter.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ararat 3d version 1.gif|300px|thumb|right|Mount Ararat 3D]]\n\n===Summit ice cap===\nThe [[ice cap]] on the summit of Mount Ararat has been shrinking since at least 1957.

Covering an area of {{convert|1100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is the largest volcanic edifice within the region. Along its northwest\u2013southeast trending long axis, Mount Ararat is about {{convert|45|km|mi|sp=us}} long and is about {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} long along its short axis. It consists of about {{convert|1150|km3|abbr=on}} of [[dacite|dacitic]] and [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] debris and dacitic, rhyolitic, and [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\nMount Ararat consists of two distinct volcanic cones, Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat ([[Little Ararat]]). The western volcanic cone, Greater Ararat, is a steep-sided volcanic cone that is larger and higher than the eastern volcanic cone. Greater Ararat is about {{convert|25|km|mi|sp=us}} wide at the base and rises about {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} above the adjacent floors of the I\u011fdir and Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t basins. The eastern volcanic cone, Lesser Ararat, is {{convert|3896|m|ft|sp=us}} high and {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} across. These volcanic cones, which lie {{convert|13|km|mi|sp=us}} apart, are separated by a wide north\u2013south-trending crack. This crack is the surface expression of an extensional [[Fault (geology)|fault]]. Numerous [[parasitic cone]]s and [[lava dome]]s have been built by flank eruptions along this fault and on the flanks of both of the main volcanic cones.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\nMount Ararat lies within a complex, sinistral [[pull-apart basin]] that originally was a single, continuous depression. The growth of Mount Ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins, the I\u011fdir and Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t basins. This pull-apart basin is the result of [[Strike slip fault|strike-slip]] movement along two en-echelon fault segments, the [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t\u2013G\u00fcrbulak Fault|Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t\u2013G\u00fcrbulak]] and [[I\u011fdir Fault]]s, of a sinistral strike\u2013slip fault system. Tension between these faults not only formed the original pull-apart basin, but created a system of faults, exhibiting a horsetail splay pattern, that control the position of the principal volcanic eruption centers of Mount Ararat and associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones. The strike-slip fault system within which Mount Ararat is located is the result of north\u2013south convergence and [[Tectonism|tectonic]] compression between the Arabian Platform and [[Laurasia]] that continued after the [[Tethys Ocean]] closed during the [[Eocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] along the Bitlis\u2013Zagros [[Suture (geology)|suture]].<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/><ref name=DeweyOther1986a>{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=J.

The closure of these masses of [[continental crust]] collapsed this [[ocean basin]] by middle Eocene and resulted in a progressive shallowing of the remnant seas, until the end of the early Miocene. Post-collisional tectonic convergence within the collision zone resulted in the total elimination of the remaining seas from East Anatolia at the end of early Miocene, crustal shortening and thickening across the collision zone, and uplift of the East Anatolian\u2013Iranian plateau. Accompanying this uplift was extensive deformation by faulting and folding, which resulted in the creation of numerous local basins. The north\u2013south compressional deformation continues today as evidenced by ongoing faulting, volcanism, and seismicity.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/><ref name=DeweyOther1986a/><ref name=KarakhanianOther2004a/>\n\nWithin Anatolia, regional volcanism started in the middle-late Miocene. During the late Miocene\u2013[[Pliocene]] period, widespread volcanism blanketed the entire East Anatolian\u2013Iranian plateau under thick volcanic rocks. This volcanic activity has continued uninterrupted until historical times. Apparently, it reached a climax during the latest Miocene\u2013Pliocene, 6 to 3 Ma. During the [[Quaternary]], the volcanism became restricted to a few local volcanoes such as Mount Ararat. These volcanoes are typically associated with north\u2013south tensional fractures formed by the continuing north\u2013south shortening deformation of Anatolia.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\nIn their detailed study and summary of the Quaternary volcanism of Anatolia, Yilmaz et al. recognized four phases to the construction of Mount Ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into its flanks.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/> First, they recognized a ''fissure eruption phase'' of [[Plinian eruption|Plinian-subPlinian]] [[Fissure vent|fissure eruptions]] that deposited more than {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic [[lava flow]]s. These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest\u2013south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a ''cone-building phase'' began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to {{convert|150|m|ft|sp=us}} thick and [[pyroclastic flow]]s of [[andesite]] and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low conical profile. Third, during a ''climatic phase'', copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a ''flank eruption phase'', during which a major north\u2013south-trending fault offset the two cones that developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano's flanks. Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t plain and along the southerly flowing Sar\u0131su River. These lava flows formed black [[\u02bba\u02bb\u0101]] and [[p\u0101hoehoe]] lava flows that contain well preserved [[lava tube]]s.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/> The [[radiometric dating]] of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma.<ref name=AllenOther2011a>{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Mark B.|last2=Mark|first2=Darren F.|last3=Kheirkhah|first3=Monireh|last4=Barfod|first4=Dan|last5=Emami|first5=Mohammad H.|last6=Saville|first6=Christopher|title=40Ar/39Ar dating of Quaternary lavas in northwest Iran: constraints on the landscape evolution and incision rates of the Turkish\u2013Iranian plateau|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|date=2011|volume=185|issue=3|pages=1175\u20131188|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246x.2011.05022.x|bibcode=2011GeoJI.185.1175A|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13575/1/13575.pdf}}</ref> Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.<ref name=YilmazOther1998a/>\n\n===Recent volcanic and seismic activity===\nThe chronology of [[Holocene]] volcanic activity associated with Mount Ararat is documented by either archaeological excavations, oral history, historical records, or a combination of these data, which provide evidence that volcanic eruptions of Mount Ararat occurred in 2500\u20132400 BC, 550 BC, possibly in 1450 AD and 1783 AD, and definitely in 1840 AD.
