{"title_page": "Danish phonology", "text_new": "{{selfref|For assistance with IPA transcriptions of Danish for Wikipedia articles, see [[Help:IPA/Danish]]. For the transcription system based on the Danish orthography, see [[Dania transcription]].}}\n{{IPA notice}}\n\nThe [[phonology]] of [[Danish language|Danish]] is similar to that of the other closely related [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but it also has distinct features setting it apart. For example, Danish has a [[suprasegmental]] feature known as [[st\u00f8d]] which is a kind of laryngeal phonation that is used phonemically. It also exhibits extensive [[lenition]] of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages. Because of that and a few other things, spoken Danish is rather hard to understand for Norwegians and Swedes, although they can easily read it.\n\n== Consonants ==\nDanish has at least 17 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

Long vowels may have [[Danish phonology#St.C3.B8d|st\u00f8d]],{{cn|date=January 2020}} thus making it possible to distinguish 30 different vowels in stressed syllables. However, vowel length and st\u00f8d are most likely features of the syllable rather than of the vowel.\n\nThese [[allophone]]s can be analyzed into 11 distinctive vowels, where allophonic alternation mainly depends on whether the vowel occurs before or after {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|unrounded}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|rounded}}\n|-\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n|-\n!

It also exhibits extensive [[lenition]] of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages.

These vowels are shown here in a narrow transcription.\n\n{{IPA|/\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u0250/}} occur only in unstressed syllables and thus can only be short. With the exception of {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u028c/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} all stressed vowels may be either long and short, including {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} (only phonetically, it is mostly long though as its phonemic short counterpart is {{IPA|/a/}}). {{IPA|/\u028c/}} is always short, whereas its phonemic long counterpart {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} is mostly long, except before {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} (the short {{IPA|[\u0254\u031d]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/o/}}). Long vowels may have [[Danish phonology#St.C3.B8d|st\u00f8d]],{{cn|date=January 2020}} thus making it possible to distinguish 30 different vowels in stressed syllables. However, vowel length and st\u00f8d are most likely features of the syllable rather than of the vowel.\n\nThese [[allophone]]s can be analyzed into 11 distinctive vowels, where allophonic alternation mainly depends on whether the vowel occurs before or after {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|unrounded}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|rounded}}\n|-\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n|-\n!

[[Education City]], a large campus where U.S. and European universities reside, hosted a series of religious prayers and lectures as part of a month-long annual Ramadan program in 2015. The prayers and lectures were held at [[Education City]]'s new lavish mosque in Doha. [[Education City]] also affords campus space to other American universities such as [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]].\n\nAmong those who have attended [[Education City]] lectures is a Saudi preacher who described the ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' massacre in Paris as \"the sequel to the comedy film of 9/11\", and another cleric who wrote, \"Jews and their helpers must be destroyed.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/24/qatar-s-foundation-for-hypocrisy.html|title=Qatar's Foundation for Hypocrisy|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|date=24 June 2015|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> The mosque in [[Education City]] has hosted extremist Anti-Semitic Wahhabi preachers speaking against \"Zionist aggressors\" in their sermons, and calling upon Allah \"to count them in number and kill them completely, do not spare a [single] one of them.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Qatar has reportedly sent Jewish professors back to America,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510701773-houston-community-college-scales-back-operation-in-qatar|title=Houston Community College scales back operation in Qatar|last=Nakano|first=Hanna|website=gulfnewsjournal.com|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> and students attending American universities in Qatar are reportedly required to dress in a manner respectful to Wahhabism.<ref>{{cite news|title=While U.S. universities see dollar signs in Qatari partnerships, some cry foul|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510639673-while-u-s-universities-see-dollar-signs-in-qatari-partnerships-some-cry-foul|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Gulf News Journal|date=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===European expansion===\nThere has been much concern, expressed in both American and European media and scholarship, over the fact that Wahhabi countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been financing mosques and buying up land all over Europe.

In 2016, the citizens of Brussels, Belgium overturned a 2015 decision to build a 600-person mosque next to the Qatari embassy. Fear largely emanates from the fact that Belgian citizens see the mosque as an opportunity for a Wahhabi country to exert control over Muslims in Europe, thus spreading the more extreme sect of Islam.<ref name=\"petrodollar\" />\n \nSeveral articles have been written that list the [[Cork Islamic Cultural Center]] as an example of one of many properties throughout Europe, paid for by the Qatari government, in an effort to spread an extreme and intolerant form of Islam known as Wahhabism.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe [[Assalam Mosque]] is located in Nantes, France was also a source on some controversy. Construction on the mosque began in 2009 and was completed in 2012. It is the largest mosque in its region in France.

These activists expressed fear that the Qatari government aimed to build Mosques all over Europe to spread Wahhabism. But the government quashed the lawsuit.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

In middle to low-income countries, water should be boiled before consumption. In high income countries, water could be treated with ultraviolet light for those at risk of contracting melioidosis. Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work.

The time taken for fever to be resolved can be more than 10 days in those with deep-seated infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosage for intravenous ceftazidime is 2g 6-hourly in adults (50&nbsp;mg/kg up to 2g in children less than 15 years old). The dosage for meropenem is 1g 8-hourly in adults (25&nbsp;mg/kg up to 1g in children).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to ceftazidime, carbapenems, and co-amoxiclav are rare in the intensive phase but are more prominent during eradication therapy. There are no differences between using cefoperazone/sulbactam or ceftazidime to treat melioidosis as both show similar death rates and disease progression following treatment.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> For those with kidney impairment, the dosage of ceftazidime, meropenem, and co-trimoxazole should be lowered.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Once the clinical condition improved, meropenem can be switched back to ceftazidime.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Eradication phase===\nFollowing the treatment of the acute disease, eradication (or maintenance) treatment with [[co-trimoxazole]] is the drug of choice and should be used for at least 3 months. For those with neurological melioidosis and [[osteomyelitis]], drugs should be given for more than 6 months. Co-amoxiclav and [[doxycycline]] are drugs of second choice. Co-trimoxazole should not be used in those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] deficiency as it can cause [[haemolytic anemia]]. Other side effects such as rash, [[hyperkalemia]], renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt the reduction of co-trimoxazole doses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Chloramphenicol]] is no longer routinely recommended for this purpose.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, co-amoxiclav is the drug of choice for children and pregnant women. However, ''B. pseudomallei'' often acquires resistance when this drug is used.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosing regimen for co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in eradication phase is 6/30&nbsp;mg/kg, up to maximum 240/1200&nbsp;mg in children, 240/1200&nbsp;mg in adults weighing 40 to 60&nbsp;kg, and 320/1600&nbsp;mg in adults weighing more than 60&nbsp;kg, taken orally every 12 hours. In children, co-trimoxazole is taken together with [[folic acid]] (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg up to 5&nbsp;mg in children). There are also cases where melioidosis is successfully treated with co-trimoxazole for 3 months without going through intensive therapy provided that there is only skin manifestations without involvement of internal organs or sepsis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to cotrimoxazole is rare in Australia.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nSurgical drainage is indicated for single, large abscesses in the liver, muscle, and prostate. However, for multiple abscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney, surgical drainage may not be possible or necessary. For septic arthritis, [[arthrotomy]] washout and drainage is required. Surgical [[debridement]] may be necessary. For those with [[mycotic aneurysm]], urgent surgery is required for prosthetic vascular grafts. Life-long therapy with co-trimoxazole may be needed for those with prosthetic vascular grafts. Other abscesses rarely need to be drained because the majority of them can resolve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In Australia, prostate abscess may require routine imaging and drainage.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\n===Others===\nImmunomodulating therapies such as [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[Interleukin 7]], and anti-PDI ([[programmed cell death]]) could be useful in melioidosis treatment especially for those with septic shock. This is because these drugs could help to boost the human body immune function against the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nIn well-resourced settings, where the disease can be detected and treated early, the risk of death is 10%. In resource-poor settings, the risk of death from the disease is more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nFor those with incomplete treatment, reppearance of symptoms after a period of disease [[cure|remission]] (\"[[recrudescence]]\") can occur. Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin.

The earliest conclusively human remains found in Australia are those of [[Lake Mungo remains|Mungo Man LM3 and Mungo Lady]], which have been dated to around 50,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Bowler|Johnston|Olley|Prescott|2003}} Recent archaeological evidence from the analysis of charcoal and artefacts revealing human use suggests a date as early as 65,000 BP.{{sfn|Davidson|Wahlquist|2017}}{{sfn|Wright|2017}} [[Luminescence dating]] has suggested habitation in [[Arnhem Land]] as far back as 60,000 years BP.{{sfn|Bird|Turney|Fifield|Jones|2002|p=1074}} Evidence of fires in South-West Australia suggest \"human presence in Australia 120,000 years ago\", although more research is required.{{sfn|Carey|Sherwood|Price|Bowler|2018|pp=71\u201393}} Genetic research has inferred a date of habitation as early as 80,000 years BP.

In present-day Australia these groups are further divided into local communities.{{sfn|Hodge|1990}} At the time of initial European settlement, over 250 [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] were spoken; it is currently estimated that 120 to 145 of these remain in use, but only 13 of these are not considered endangered.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}{{sfn|AIATSIS|2014}} Aboriginal people today mostly speak English, with Aboriginal phrases and words being added to create [[Australian Aboriginal English]] (which also has a tangible influence of Indigenous languages in the phonology and grammatical structure).\n\nThe [[Australian Census]] includes counts of Indigenous peoples, based on questions relating to individuals' self-identification as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, or of both origins. {{As of|2016|6|30}}, the count was 798,365, or 3.3% of Australia's population.{{sfn|ABoS|2016}} Since 1995, the [[Australian Aboriginal flag]] and the [[Torres Strait Islander flag]] have been among the official [[List of Australian flags|flags of Australia]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Australian Aboriginal Flag.svg|thumb|Harold Thomas' Australian Aboriginal Flag]]\n\n===Variations===\nThere is a number of appropriate terms to use when referring to Indigenous peoples of Australia, but there is general agreement that it is important to respect the \"preferences of individuals, families, or communities, and allow them to define what they are most comfortable with\" when referring to Indigenous people.{{sfn|Common Ground}}\n\nThe word [[wikt:aboriginal|aboriginal]] has been in the English language since at least the 16th century to mean, \"first or earliest known, indigenous\". It comes from the Latin word ''aborigines'', derived from ''ab'' (from) and ''origo'' (origin, beginning).{{sfn|Aborigine \u2013 Definition|2012}} The term was used in Australia to describe its [[Indigenous peoples]] as early as 1789. It became capitalised and was employed as the common name to refer to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, although today the latter are not included in the term. The term \"Aborigine\" is deprecated, being regarded as outdated and inappropriate, having connotations of [[colonial Australia]].{{sfn|Common Ground}}{{sfn|Appropriate words & terminology}}\n\nWhile the term \"Indigenous Australians\" has grown since the 1980s,{{sfn|Flinders University|1996}} many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples dislike it, feeling that it is too generic and removes their identity. However, the term has a practical application and can be used where appropriate.{{sfn|Common Ground}}\n\nIn recent years, \"First Nations\",{{sfn|Media RING|2018}} \"First Peoples\"{{sfn|MCA}} and \"First Australians\" have become more common. First Nations is considered the most acceptable by most people.{{sfn|Common Ground}}\n\nBeing as specific as possible, for example naming the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|language group]] (such as [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]]), [[demonym]] relating to geographic area (such as [[Nunga]]), is considered best practice and most respectful. (See also below under [[Indigenous Australians#Regional groups|Regional groups]] section.) The abbreviation \"ATSI\" (for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) is considered disrespectful.{{sfn|Appropriate words & terminology}}\n\n==== Terms \"black\" and \"blackfella\" ====\nThe term \"black\" has been used to refer to Indigenous Australians since European settlement.{{sfn|''Hobart Town Courier''|1828|p=1}} While originally related to [[skin colour]] and often used pejoratively,{{sfn|Common Ground}} the term is used today to indicate Aboriginal heritage or culture in general and refers to any people of such heritage regardless of their level of skin pigmentation.{{sfn|Bird|2011}} In the 1970s, many Aboriginal activists, such as [[Gary Foley]], proudly embraced the term \"black\", and writer [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]]'s book from the time was entitled ''Living Black''. The book included interviews with several members of the Aboriginal community, including [[Robert Jabanungga]], reflecting on contemporary Aboriginal culture.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Use of this term varies depending on context and its use needs care as it may be deemed inappropriate.{{sfn|Common Ground}}\n\nA less formal term, used by Indigenous Australians and not normally derogatory, is \"[[blackfella]]s\", as distinguished from \"whitefellas\". Some people consider its use by white people offensive.{{sfn|Common Ground}}\n\n=== Regional groups ===\n====Aboriginal groups====\n[[File:Men and boys playing a game of gorri - NMA-11726.jpg|thumb|Men and boys playing a game of [[gorri]], 1922]]\n{{Main|Aboriginal Australians|List of Australian Aboriginal group names|Aboriginal Australians#Aboriginal Australian peoples}}\n\nAboriginal peoples of Australia are the various peoples indigenous to mainland Australia and associated islands, excluding the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nThe broad term Aboriginal Australians includes many regional groups that may be identified under names based on local language, locality, or what they are called by neighbouring groups. Some communities, cultures or groups may be inclusive of others and alter or overlap; significant changes have occurred in the generations after colonisation. The word \"community\" is often used to describe groups identifying by [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship]], [[Australian Aboriginal language|language]] or belonging to a particular place or \"country\". A community may draw on separate cultural values and individuals can conceivably belong to a number of communities within Australia; identification within them may be adopted or rejected. An individual community may identify itself by many names, each of which can have alternative English spellings.\n[[File:Aboriginal farmers at Franklinford 1858.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal farmers in Victoria, 1858]]\nThe naming of peoples is complex and multi-layered, but a few examples are [[Anangu]] in northern [[South Australia]], and neighbouring parts of Western Australia and [[Northern Territory]]; [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] in central Australia; [[Koori]] (or Koorie) in New South Wales and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] ([[Aboriginal Victorians]]); Goorie (variant pronunciation and spelling of Koori) in South East Queensland and some parts of northern New South Wales; [[Murri people|Murri]] used in parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales where specific collective names are not used; [[Tiwi people]] of the [[Tiwi Islands]] off NT, and [[Palawah]] in [[Tasmania]].

Settlements were subsequently established in [[Tasmania]] (1803), [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (1803), [[Queensland]] (1824), [[Western Australia]] (1826), and the [[Colony of South Australia]] (1836).{{sfn|Broome|2010|p=18}}\n\nThe first settlement in the [[Northern Territory]] was built after Captain [[Gordon Bremer]] took possession of the [[Tiwi Islands]] of [[Bathurst Island (Australia)|Bathurst]] and [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville]], claiming them for the [[colony of New South Wales]], although that settlement failed after a few years,{{sfn|Morris|2001|p=245}} along with a couple of later attempts; permanent settlement was only finally achieved at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1869.\n\nAustralia was the exception to British imperial colonisation practices, in that no treaty was drawn up setting out terms of agreement between the settlers and native proprietors, as was the case in North America, and [[Treaty of Waitangi|New Zealand]].{{sfn|Broome|2010|p=18}} Many of the men on the First Fleet had had military experience among Native American tribes in North America, and tended to attribute to the Aboriginal people alien and misleading systems or concepts like [[Tribal chief|chieftainship]] and [[tribe]] with which they had become acquainted in the northern hemisphere.{{sfn|Foley|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\nBritish administrative control began in the Torres Strait Islands in 1862, with the appointment of John Jardine, police magistrate at [[Rockhampton]], as Government Resident in the Torres Straits. He originally established a small settlement on [[Albany Island]], but on 1 August 1864 he went to Somerset Island.{{sfn|Lack|1963|pp=132\u2013153}} English missionaries arrived on [[Darnley Island, Torres Strait|Erub (Darnley Island)]] on 1 July 1871.{{sfn|TSRA - history}} In 1872 the boundary of Queensland was extended to include [[Thursday Island]] and some other islands in Torres Strait within {{convert|60| miles|km}} of the Queensland coast, and in 1879 Queensland [[Annexation|annexed]] the other islands, which became part of the British [[colony of Queensland]].{{sfn|Lack|1963|pp=132\u2013153}}\n\n====Impact====\nOne immediate consequence was a series of epidemics of European diseases such as [[measles]], [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. In the 19th century, smallpox was the principal cause of Aboriginal deaths, and vaccinations of the \"native inhabitants\" had begun in earnest by the 1840s.{{sfn|Glynn|Jenifer|2004|pp=145\u2013146}} This smallpox epidemic in 1789 is estimated to have killed up to 90% of the [[Darug people]]. The cause of the outbreak is disputed. Some scholars have attributed it to European settlers,{{sfn|Heiss|Melodie-Jane|2013}}{{sfn|Blackwell Public School|n.d.}} but it is also argued that [[Makassar|Macassan]] fishermen from [[South Sulawesi]] and nearby islands may have introduced smallpox to Australia before the arrival of Europeans.{{sfn|Campbell|2007}} A third suggestion is that the outbreak was caused by contact with members of the [[First Fleet]].{{sfn|Mear|2008|pp=1\u201322}} A fourth theory is that the epidemic was of [[chickenpox]], not smallpox, carried by members of the First Fleet, and to which the Aboriginal people also had no immunity.{{sfn|McIlroy|2013}}{{sfn|Carmody|2013}}{{sfn|Kociumbas|2004|pp=79ff}}{{sfn|''United Service''|2014|p=7}}\n\nAnother consequence of British colonisation was European seizure of land and water resources, with the decimation of kangaroo and other indigenous foodstuffs which continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries as rural lands were converted for sheep and cattle grazing.{{sfn|Pascoe|2007|pp=182\u2013185}} Settlers also participated in the rape and forcible prostitution of Aboriginal women.{{sfn|Connor|2016}} Despite this a number of Europeans, including convicts, formed favourable impressions of Aboriginal life through living with Aboriginal Groups.{{sfn|Maynard|Haskins|2016}}\n\nIn 1834 there occurred the first recorded use of [[Aboriginal tracker]]s, who proved very adept at navigating their way through the Australian landscape and finding people.{{sfn|Spooner|Firman|Yalmambirra|2013|p=329}}\n\nDuring the 1860s, [[Tasmanian Aboriginal]] skulls were particularly sought internationally for studies into [[craniofacial anthropometry]]. The skeleton of [[Truganini]], a Tasmanian Aboriginal who died in 1876, was exhumed within two years of her death despite her pleas to the contrary by the [[Royal Society of Tasmania]], and later placed on display. Campaigns continue to have Aboriginal body parts returned to Australia for burial; Truganini's body was returned in 1976 and cremated, and her ashes were scattered according to her wishes.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}<!--in her article linked above--><!---yes, but still needs citations in this article--->\n\nPlace names sometimes reveal discrimination, such as Mount Jim Crow in [[Rockhampton, Queensland]] (now [[Mount Baga]]), as well as racist policies, like Brisbane's Boundary Streets which used to indicate boundaries where Aboriginal people were not allowed to cross during certain times of the day.{{sfn|Condon|2011}} There is ongoing discussion about changing many of these names.{{sfn|McMah|2016}}{{sfn|Terzon|Robinson|2018}}\n\n[[File:Indigenous-wages-graph.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the destination of Indigenous wages in Queensland in the 19th and 20th centuries]]\nThroughout most of the 19th and 20th centuries, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had their lives under the jurisdiction of various state-based protection laws. These [[Acts of Parliament]] appointed [[Protectors of Aborigines]] and [[Aboriginal Protection Board]]s, whose role was to ensure the safety of Indigenous Australians as well as controlling their lives in matters of employment and marriage. Wages were controlled by the Protectors, and Indigenous Australians received less income than their non-Indigenous counterparts in employment.{{sfn|GoQ}}{{sfn|GoQ|2016}}\n\nDuring this time, many Aboriginal people were victims of slavery by colonists alongside [[Pacific Islander]] peoples who were kidnapped from their homes, in a practice known as [[blackbirding]]. Between 1860 and 1970, under the guise of protectionist policies, people, including children as young as 12, were forced to work on properties where they worked under horrific conditions and most did not receive any wages.{{sfn|Simmonds|2015}} In the [[pearl hunting|pearling]] industry, Aboriginal peoples were bought for about 5 pounds, with pregnant Aboriginal women \"prized because their lungs were believed to have greater air capacity\"{{sfn|Korff|2018b}} Aboriginal prisoners in the Aboriginal-only prison on [[Rottnest Island]], many of whom were there on trumped up charges, were chained up and forced to work.{{sfn|Murphy|2017}} In 1971, 373 Aboriginal men were found buried in unmarked graves on the island.{{sfn|Melville|2016}} Up until June 2018, the former prison was being used as holiday accommodation.{{sfn|Wynne|2018}}\n\nFrom 1810, Aboriginal peoples were moved onto mission stations, run by churches and the state.{{sfn|Korff|2018a}} While they provided food and shelter, their purpose was to \"civilise\" Aboriginal communities by teaching western values. After this period of protectionist policies that aimed to segregate and control Aboriginal populations, in 1937 the Commonwealth government agreed to move towards assimilation policies. These policies aimed to integrate Aboriginal persons who were \"not of full blood\" into the white community in an effort to eliminate the \"Aboriginal problem\". As part of this, there was an increase in the number of children forcibly removed from their homes and placed with white people, either in institutions or foster homes.{{sfn|''Face the Facts''|2005}}\n\n====Frontier Wars====\n{{main|Australian frontier wars|List of massacres of Indigenous Australians}}\nAs part of the colonisation process, there were many small-scale conflicts and clashes between colonists and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across the continent and islands. In Queensland, the killing of Aboriginal peoples was largely perpetrated by civilian \"hunting\" parties and the Native Police, armed groups of Aboriginal men who were recruited at gunpoint and led by colonialist to eliminate Aboriginal resistance.{{sfn|Richards|2014|pp=147\u2013161}} There is evidence that massacres of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, which began with arrival of British colonists, continued until the 1930s.

After losing a significant number of their social unit in one blow, the survivors were left very vulnerable \u2013 with reduced ability to gather food, reproduce, or fulfill their ceremonial obligations, as well as defend themselves against further attack.{{sfn|Colonial frontier massacres - C21CH}}\n\nEstimating the total number of deaths during the frontier wars is difficult due to lack of records and the fact that many massacres of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander were kept secret.{{sfn|University of Newcastle|2017b}} It is often quoted that 20,000 Aboriginal Australians and 2000 colonists died in the frontier wars;{{sfn|First encounters and frontier conflict|2015}} however, recent research indicates at least 40,000 Aboriginal dead and 2,000 to 2,500 settlers dead.{{sfn|Reynolds|2013|pp=121\u2013134}} Other research indicates a minimum of 65,000 Aboriginal peoples may have been killed in Queensland alone.{{sfn|Daley|2014}} There have been arguments over whether deaths of Aboriginal peoples, particularly in Tasmania, as well as the forcible removal of children from Aboriginal communities, constitutes [[genocide]].{{sfn|Harman|2018}}{{sfn|Dirk Moses|2017}}{{sfn|Rogers|Bain|2016|pp=83\u2013100}} Many place names in Australia mark places of frontier massacres, for example [[Murdering Gully massacre|Murdering Gully]] in Newcastle.{{sfn|Cronshaw|2018}}\n\n====Resistance====\nThere has always been Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander resistance, from the arrival of colonists through to now.{{sfn|''Resistance''}}\n* In 1938, over 100 Aboriginal peoples protested one of the first [[Australia Day]] celebrations by gathering for an \"Aborigines Conference\" in Sydney and marking the day as the \"Day of Protest and Mourning\";{{sfn|Darian-Smith|2017}} the day is now often referred to as \"Survival Day\" or \"Invasion Day\" by Indigenous peoples.\n* In 1963 the [[Yolngu people]] of [[Yirrkala]] in [[Arnhem Land]] sent two bark petitions to the Australian government to protest the granting of mining rights on their lands. The Yirrkala Bark petitions were traditional Aboriginal documents to be recognised under Commonwealth law.{{sfn|indigenous.gov.au|2013}}\n* On Australia day in 1972, 34 years after the first \"Day of Protest and Mourning\", Indigenous activists set up the [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] on the lawn of [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]] to protest the state of [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia|Aboriginal land rights]].

In 1998, a Constitutional Convention which selected a Republican model for a referendum included just six Indigenous participants, leading Monarchist delegate [[Neville Bonner]] to end his contribution to the Convention with his Jagera tribal \"Sorry Chant\" in sadness at the low number of Indigenous representatives.{{sfn|McKenna|2000}}\n\nAn inquiry into the [[Stolen Generations]] was launched in 1995 by the [[Keating Government|Keating government]], and the final report delivered in 1997 \u2013 the ''Bringing Them Home'' report \u2013 estimated that around 10% to 33% of all Aboriginal children had been separated from their families for the duration of the policies.{{sfn|Australians Together}} The succeeding [[Howard government]] largely ignored the recommendations provided by the report, one of which was a formal apology to Aboriginal Australians for the Stolen Generations.{{sfn|Australians Together}}\n\nThe republican model, as well as a proposal for a new Constitutional preamble which would have included the \"honouring\" of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, was put to [[1999 Australian republic referendum|referendum]] but did not succeed.{{sfn|McKenna|2000}} In 1999, the Australian Parliament passed a [[Motion of Reconciliation]] drafted by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] in consultation with Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] naming mistreatment of Indigenous Australians as the most \"blemished chapter in our national history\", although Howard refused to offer any formal apology.{{sfn|Brennan|2008}}\n\nOn 13 February 2008 Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] issued a formal [[apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples]], on behalf of the federal government of Australia, for the suffering caused by the Stolen Generations.{{sfn|Welch|2008}}\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2001, the Federal Government dedicated [[Reconciliation Place]] in Canberra.

The government banned alcohol in prescribed communities in the Territory; quarantined a percentage of [[Social security in Australia|welfare payments]] for essential goods purchasing; dispatched additional police and medical personnel to the region; and suspended the permit system for access to Aboriginal communities.{{sfn|Gibson|2007}} In addition to these measures, the [[Australian Army|army]] were released into communities{{sfn|McCallum|Waller|2012|pp=33\u201334}} and there were increased police powers, which were later further increased with the so-called \"paperless arrests\" legislation.<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|NT|act|paa227|Police Administration Act}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, United Nations Special Rapporteur James Anaya found the Emergency Response to be racially discriminatory, and said that aspects of it represented a limitation on \"individual autonomy\".{{sfn|Anaya|2010}}{{sfn|ABC|1980}} These findings were criticised by the government's Indigenous Affairs Minister [[Jenny Macklin]], the Opposition and Indigenous leaders like [[Warren Mundine]] and [[Bess Price]].{{sfn|Hawley|2009}}{{sfn|ABC|2011}}\n\nIn 2011, the Australian government enacted legislation to implement the [[Stronger Futures policy]], which is intended to address key issues that exist within Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory such as unemployment, school attendance and enrolment, [[alcohol abuse]], community safety and child protection, food security and housing and land reforms. The policy has been criticised by organisations such as [[Amnesty International]] and other groups, including on the basis that it maintains \"racially-discriminatory\" elements of the ''Emergency Response Act'' and continues control by the federal government over \"Aboriginal people and their lands\".{{sfn|''Stand for Freedom''|2012}}\n\n====Constitutional change proposed====\nIn 2010, the federal government appointed a panel comprising Indigenous leaders, other legal experts and some members of parliament (including Ken Wyatt) to provide advice on how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the [[Australian Constitution|federal Constitution]]. The panel's recommendations, reported to the federal government in January 2012,{{sfn|CoA|2012}} included deletion of provisions of the Constitution referencing race ([[Section 25 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 25]] and [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution|Section 51(xxvi)]]), and new provisions on meaningful recognition and further protection from discrimination.{{efn|For a discussion of the recommendations, see: {{harvnb|Wood|2012|p=156}}}} Subsequently, a [[Proposed 2013 Australian constitutional referendum|proposed referendum on Constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians]] was ultimately abandoned in 2013.\n\nThe ''[[Uluru Statement from the Heart]]''{{sfn|Uluru Statement from the Heart}} was released 26 May 2017 by delegates to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Referendum Convention, held near [[Uluru]] in Central Australia. The statement calls for a \"First Nations Voice\" in the Australian Constitution and a \"Makarrata Commission\" to supervise a process of \"agreement-making\" and \"truth-telling\" between government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.{{sfn|Uluru Statement: a quick guide}} The statement references the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] which brought about changes to the Constitution to include Indigenous Australians.\n\n== Population ==\n===Pre-colonisation===\nIt has been variously estimated that before the arrival of British settlers, the population of Indigenous (probably Aboriginal only) Australians was approximately 318,000\u20131,000,000{{sfn|Gough|2011}} with the distribution being similar to that of the current Australian population, the majority living in the south-east, centred along the [[Murray River]].{{sfn|Pardoe|2006|pp=1\u201321}}\n\n=== Definition ===\n{{see also|Australian Aboriginal  identity}}\nOver time Australia has used various means to determine membership of ethnic groups such as [[Lineage (genetic)|lineage]], [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]], birth and [[self-determination]]. From 1869 until well into the 1970s, children under 12 years of age with 25% or less Aboriginal blood were considered \"white\" and were often [[Stolen generations|removed from their families]] by the Australian [[Australian government|Federal]] and [[Australian states and territories|State]] government agencies and [[Mission (Christian)|church missions]], under [[act of parliament|acts]] of their respective parliaments in order that they would have \"a reasonable chance of absorption into the white community to which they rightly belong\".{{sfn|Bleakley|1929|p=17}} Grey areas in determination of ethnicity led to people of mixed ancestry being caught in the middle of divisive policies which often led to absurd situations:{{sfn|Spencer|2006|pp=33\u201334}} <blockquote>In 1935, an Australian of part Indigenous descent left his home on a reserve to visit a nearby hotel where he was ejected for being Aboriginal. He returned home but was refused entry to the reserve because he was not Aboriginal. He attempted to remove his children from the reserve but was told he could not because they were Aboriginal. He then walked to the next town where he was arrested for being an Aboriginal vagrant and sent to the reserve there. During [[World War II]] he tried to enlist but was rejected because he was an Aborigine so he moved to another state where he enlisted as a non-Aborigine. After the end of the war he applied for a passport but was rejected as he was an Aborigine, he obtained an exemption under the Aborigines Protection Act but was now told he could no longer visit his relatives as he was not an Aborigine. He was later told he could not join the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Servicemens Club]] because he was an Aborigine.{{sfn|Spencer|2006|pp=33\u201334}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1983 the [[High Court of Australia]] (in the ''[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]'' or \"''Tasmanian dam(s) case''\"){{sfn|AustLII|1983}} defined an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander as \"a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives\". The ruling was a three-part definition comprising descent, self-identification and community identification. The first part \u2013 descent \u2013 was genetic descent and unambiguous, but led to cases where a lack of records to prove ancestry excluded some. Self- and community identification were more problematic as they meant that an Indigenous person separated from her or his community due to a family dispute could no longer identify as Aboriginal.{{sfn|ALRC|2010}}{{sfn|Connell|1998}}\n\nAs a result, there arose court cases throughout the 1990s where excluded people demanded that their Aboriginality be recognised. As a result, lower courts refined the High Court test when subsequently applying it. In 1995, Justice Drummond in the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] held in ''Gibbs v Capewell'' \"...either genuine self-identification as Aboriginal alone or Aboriginal communal recognition as such by itself may suffice, according to the circumstances.\" This contributed to an increase of 31% in the number of people identifying as Indigenous Australians in the 1996 census when compared to the 1991 census.{{sfn|Greg Gardiner|2002}} In 1998 [[Ron Merkel|Justice Merkel]] held in ''Shaw v Wolf'' that Aboriginal descent is \"technical\" rather than \"real\" \u2013 thereby eliminating a genetic requirement.{{sfn|Connell|1998}} This decision established that anyone can classify him or herself legally as an Aboriginal, provided he or she is accepted as such by his or her community.{{sfn|ALRC|2010}}\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{Main|Demography of Australia}}\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 0054 Indigenous Persons Total Persons.svg\n | caption1  = Indigenous Australians as a percentage of the population, 2011\n | image2    = Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 0045 Indigenous Persons Aboriginal Persons.svg\n | caption2  = Aboriginal Australians as a percentage of the population, 2011\n | image3    = Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 0048 Indigenous Persons Torres Strait Islander Persons.svg\n | caption3  = Torres Strait Islanders as a percentage of the population, 2011\n | image4    = Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 0051 Indigenous Persons Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Persons.svg\n | caption4  = Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as a percentage of the population, 2011\n}}\n\n==== Inclusion in the National Census ====\n[[File:Aboriginal boys and men in front of a bush shelter - NTL PH0731-0022.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Aboriginal boys and men in front of a bush shelter, [[Groote Eylandt]], c. 1933]]\n\nUntil the [[1967 Australian referendum (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], official Australian population statistics excluded \"full-blood aboriginal natives\" in accordance with section 127 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], even though many such people were actually counted. The size of the excluded population was generally separately estimated. \"Half-caste aboriginal natives\" were shown separately up to the 1966 census, but since 1971 there has been no provision on the forms to differentiate \"full\" from \"part\" Indigenous or to identify non-Indigenous persons who are accepted by Indigenous communities but have no genetic descent.{{sfn|Gardiner-Garden|2000}}\n\nAs there is no formal procedure for any community to record acceptance, the primary method of determining Indigenous population is from self-identification on census forms.\nThe [[Australian Census]] includes counts based on questions relating to individuals' self-identification as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, or of both origins.{{sfn|ABoS|2016}} Owing to various difficulties which lead to under-counting, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) follows a set method to estimate total numbers.{{sfn|ABS tech note|2018}}\n\n==== Distribution and growth ====\n{{see also|Australian Aboriginal identity}}{{hatnote|See Infobox above for Distribution by state & territory}}\nThe 2006 [[Australian census]] showed growth in the Indigenous population (recorded as 517,000) at twice the rate of overall population growth since 1996, when the Indigenous population stood at 283,000.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In the [[2011 Australian Census|2011 census]], there was a 20% rise in people who identify as Aboriginal.{{sfn|SBS|2012}} In the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], there was another 18.4% rise on the 2011 figure. 590,056 respondents identified themselves as Aboriginal, 32,345 [[Torres Strait Islander]], and a further 26,767 both Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].{{sfn|ABoS Census|2017}}\n\nGrowth was mainly in major cities and along the eastern coast of Australia. The ABS published a report exploring the reasons for these findings, with some of the factors behind the increase being higher fertility rates of Indigenous women; people entering the population through migration; variation in census coverage and response rates; and people changing how they self-identify between census years.{{sfn|ABS increase|2018}} Another factor might be the children of mixed marriages: the proportion of Aboriginal adults married (''de facto'' or ''[[de jure]]'') to non-Aboriginal spouses increased to 78.2% in the 2016 census,{{sfn|ABoS 2077.0|2018}} (up from 74% in 2011,{{sfn|ABoS 2077.0}} 64% in 1996, 51% in 1991 and 46% in 1986); it was reported in 2002 that up to 88% of the offspring of mixed marriages subsequently self-identify as Indigenous Australians.{{sfn|Greg Gardiner|2002}}\n\nIn the 2016, over 33% of the Indigenous population lived in major cities, compared with about 75% of the non-Indigenous population, with a further 24% in \"inner regional\" areas (compared with 18%), 20% in \"outer regional\" (8%), while nearly 18% lived in \"remote\" or \"very remote\" areas (2%).{{sfn|ABoS 3238.0|2018}} (Ten years earlier, 31% were living in major cities and 24% in remote areas.{{sfn|ABoS \u2013 population|2006}})\n\n== Languages ==\n===Aboriginal languages===\n{{Main|Australian Aboriginal English|Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal sign languages}}\nAccording to the 2005 National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS), at the time the Australian continent was colonised, there were around 250 different Indigenous languages, with the larger language groups each having up to 100 related dialects.{{sfn|AIATSIS & FATSIL|2005}} Some of these languages were only ever spoken by perhaps 50 to 100 people. Indigenous languages are divided into language groups with from ten to twenty-four language families identified.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}} It is currently estimated that up to 145 Indigenous languages remain in use, of which fewer than 20 are considered to be strong in the sense that they are still spoken by all age groups.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}{{sfn|Zuckermann|2009}} All but 13 Indigenous languages are considered to be endangered.{{sfn|AIATSIS|2014}} Several extinct Indigenous languages are being reconstructed. For example, the last fluent speaker of the [[Ngarrindjeri language]] died in the late 1960s; using recordings and written records as a guide, a Ngarrindjeri dictionary was published in 2009,{{sfn|UniSA|2008}} and the Ngarrindjeri language is today being spoken in complete sentences.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}\n\nLinguists classify many of the mainland Australian languages into one large group, the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages]]. The rest are sometimes lumped under the term \"non-Pama\u2013Nyungan\". The Pama\u2013Nyungan languages comprise the majority, covering most of Australia, and are generally thought to be a family of related languages. In the north, stretching from the Western [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], are found a number of non-Pama\u2013Nyungan groups of languages which have not been shown to be related to the Pama\u2013Nyungan family nor to each other.{{sfn|Evans|2003}} While it has sometimes proven difficult to work out familial relationships within the Pama\u2013Nyungan language family, many Australian linguists feel there has been substantial success.{{sfn|Bowern|Harold|2004}} Against this, some linguists, such as [[R. M. W. Dixon]], suggest that the Pama\u2013Nyungan group \u2013 and indeed the entire Australian linguistic area \u2013 is rather a ''[[sprachbund]]'', or group of languages having very long and intimate contact, rather than a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] language family.{{sfn|Dixon|1997}}\n\nIt has been suggested that, given their long presence in Australia, Aboriginal languages form one specific sub-grouping. The position of Tasmanian languages is unknown, and it is also unknown whether they comprised one or more than one specific language family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Cross-cultural communications====\nCross-cultural miscommunication can sometimes occur between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Western conversational interaction is typically \"[[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]]\", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and \"contained\" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Aboriginal conversational interaction is \"communal\", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and \"continuous\", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.{{sfn|Zuckermann|2015|p=12}}{{sfn|Walsh|1997|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n===Torres Strait Island languages===\n{{main|Torres Strait Island languages}}\nThere are three languages spoken in the [[Torres Strait Islands]], two indigenous languages and an English-based creole.  The indigenous language spoken mainly in the western and central islands is [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]], a language related to the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages]] of the Australian mainland. The other indigenous language spoken mainly in the eastern islands is [[Meriam language|Meriam Mir]]: a member of the [[Trans-Fly languages]] spoken on the nearby south coast of New Guinea and the only [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken on Australian territory. Both languages are [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]]; however Kalaw Lagaw Ya appears to be undergoing a transition into a [[declension]]al language while Meriam M\u00ecr is more clearly agglutinative. [[Torres Strait Creole|Yumplatok]], or Torres Strait Creole, the third language, is a non-typical Pacific English Creole and is the main language of communication on the islands.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Belief systems ==\n[[File:William BARAK - Wurundjeri people - Corroboree - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a [[corroboree]] by 19th century Indigenous activist [[William Barak]]]]\n\n===Traditional beliefs===\n====Aboriginal====\n{{further|Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology}}\nWithin Aboriginal belief systems, a formative epoch known as \"the [[Dreamtime]]\" or \"the Dreaming\" stretches back into the distant past when the creator ancestors known as the First Peoples travelled across the land, and naming as they went. Indigenous Australia's [[oral tradition]] and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this Dreamtime.{{sfn|Andrews|2004|p=424}} The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. Different language and cultural groups each had their own belief structures; these cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. Major [[ancestral]] spirits include the [[Rainbow Serpent]], [[Baiame]], [[Dirawong]] and [[Bunjil]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Knowledge contained in the Dreaming has been passed down through different stories, [[songline]]s, dances and ceremonies, and even today provides a framework for ongoing relationships, [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship responsibilities]] and looking after country.{{sfn|WVA - 8 interesting facts}}\n\nTraditional healers (known as [[Ngangkari]] in the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western desert]] areas of Central Australia) were highly respected men and women who not only acted as healers or doctors, but were generally also custodians of important Dreaming stories.{{sfn|Traditional Healers|2013|pp=15\u201319}}\n\n====Torres Strait Islander====\n{{further||Torres Strait Islanders#Religion and beliefs}}\nTorres Strait Islander people have their own traditional belief systems.

As in many [[colonialism|colonial]] situations, the churches both facilitated the loss of Indigenous culture and religion and also facilitated its maintenance.{{sfn|Mundine|2005}} In some cases, such as at [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory]] and [[Piltawodli]] in Adelaide, the work of missionaries laid the foundations for later [[language revival]]. The German missionaries [[Christian Teichelmann]] and [[Clamor Sch\u00fcrmann|Sch\u00fcrmann]] went to [[Adelaide]] and taught the local [[Kaurna]] people only in [[Kaurna language|their own language]] and created textbooks in the language.{{sfn|Lockwood|2017|pp=65\u201381}}{{sfn|Amery}} However, some [[missionaries]] taught only in English, and some [[Christian mission]]s were involved in the placement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children after they were removed from their parents upon orders of the government, and are therefore implicated in the [[Stolen Generations]].\n\n====Aboriginal peoples====\nThe involvement of Christians in Aboriginal affairs has evolved significantly since 1788.{{sfn|Mundine|2005}} The Churches became involved in mission work among Aboriginal peoples in the 19th century as Europeans came to control much of the continent, and the majority of the population was eventually converted. Colonial clergy such as Sydney's first Catholic archbishop, [[John Bede Polding]], strongly advocated for Aboriginal rights and dignity.{{sfn|O'Sullivan}} Around the year 2000, many churches and church organisations officially apologised for past failures to adequately respect Indigenous cultures and address the injustices of the dispossession of Indigenous people.{{sfn|Mundine|2005}}{{sfn|Anglican Church|2005}}\n\nA small minority of Aboriginal people are [[Islam in Australia#Aboriginal Muslims|followers of Islam]]<!--see Talk#Religious beliefs \u2013 Islam?--> as a result of intermarriage with [[Afghan cameleers in Australia|\"Afghan\" camel drivers]] brought to Australia in the late 19th and early 20th century to help explore and open up the interior.{{sfn|Mercer|2003}}\n\n====Torres Strait Islander peoples====\nFrom the 1870s, [[Christianity]] spread throughout the Torres Strait Islands, and it remains strong today among Torres Strait Islander people everywhere. The [[London Missionary Society]] mission led by Rev. Samuel Macfarlane arrived on [[Darnley Island, Torres Strait|Erub (Darnley Island)]] on 1 July 1871, establishing its first base in the region there. The Islanders refer to this as \"The Coming of the Light\", or \"Coming of Light\"{{sfn|Korff|2019b}} and all Island communities celebrate the occasion annually on 1 July.{{sfn|TSRA - history}} However the coming of Christianity did not spell the end of the people's traditional beliefs; their culture informed their understanding of the new religion, as the [[Christian God]] was welcomed and the new religion was integrated into every aspect of their everyday lives.{{sfn|Korff|2019b}}\n\n===Recent census figures===\nIn the 2016 Census, Australia's Indigenous and non-Indigenous population were broadly similar with 54% (vs 55%) reporting a [[Christianity in Australia|Christian]] affiliation, while less than 2% reported traditional beliefs as their religion, and 36% reported no religion. The proportion of Indigenous people who reported no religion has increased gradually since 2001, standing at 36% in 2016. According to \"Table 8: Religious Affiliation by Indigenous Status\", 347,572 Indigenous people (out of the total 649,171 in Australia) declared an affiliation to some form of Christianity, with a higher proportion of Torres Strait Islander than Aboriginal people in this number. 7,773 reported traditional beliefs; 1,511 Islam; other religions numbered less than 1,000 each.

Not only were many of the [[child abuse|children abused]] \u2013 [[psychological abuse|psychologically]], [[physical abuse|physically]], or [[sexual abuse|sexually]] \u2013 after being removed and while living in group homes or adoptive families, but were also deprived of their culture alongside their families.{{sfn|Australians Together}} This has resulted in the disruption of [[oral history|oral culture]], as parents were unable to communicate their knowledge to their children, and thus much has been lost.{{sfn|Australians Together}}\n\nThere are many issues facing Indigenous people in Australia today when compared with the non-Indigenous population, despite some improvements. Several of these are interrelated, and include health (including shorter [[life expectancy]] and higher rates of [[infant mortality]]), lower levels of education and employment, inter-generational trauma, high [[Indigenous Australians and crime|imprisonment rates]], [[substance abuse]] and lack of political representation.{{sfn|Australians Together}}\n\nSome demographic facts are related to these issues, as cause and/or result:\n\n* In the [[2016 Australian Census]], over 33% of the Indigenous population lived in major cities, compared with about 75% of the non-Indigenous population, with a further 24% in \"inner regional\" areas (compared with 18%), 20% in \"outer regional\" (8%), while nearly 18% lived in \"remote\" or \"very remote\" areas (2%).{{sfn|ABoS 3238.0|2018}}\n* The Indigenous population of Australia is much younger than the non-Indigenous population, with an estimated [[median age]] of 21 years (37 years for non-Indigenous), due to higher rates of birth and death.{{sfn|ABoS|2008}} For this reason, [[age adjustment|age standardisation]] is often used when comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous statistics.{{sfn|ABoS|2005a}}\n\nThe federal government's [[Closing the Gap]] strategy, created in 2008 and coordinated by the [[National Indigenous Australians Agency]] since July 2019, aims to address multiple areas to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples. Draft targets for 2019 were created by the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG) in December 2018. These were in the following areas:{{sfn|NIAA|2018}}\n* families, children and youth\n* health\n* education\n* economic development\n* housing\n* justice (including [[Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory|youth justice]])\n* land and water, \"where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' land, water and cultural rights are realised\"\n* cross-system priorities, which \"addresses racism, discrimination and social inclusion, healing and trauma, and the promotion of culture and language for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\"\n\n=== Health ===\n{{see also|Indigenous health in Australia}}\n\nSocial and cultural determinants such as [[racism|discrimination]], lack of education or employment (and therefore [[income]]), and cultural disconnection can impact both physical and mental health, and contemporary disadvantage is related to colonisation and its ongoing impact.{{sfn|Australians Together|2014}}{{sfn|Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|2019}}\n\nSuccessive censuses have shown, that (after adjusting for demographic structures) Indigenous Australians experience greater rates of [[renal disease]], several [[communicable diseases]] (such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[hepatitis C virus]]), [[type 2 diabetes]], [[respiratory disease]], poor [[mental health]] and other illnesses than the general population.{{sfn|Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|2019}}{{sfn|ABoS|2005a}}\n\n====Life expectancy====\nThe life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is difficult to quantify accurately. Indigenous deaths are poorly identified, and the official figures for the size of the population at risk include large adjustment factors. Two estimates of Indigenous life expectancy in 2008 differed by as much as five years.{{sfn|''National Indigenous Times''|2008}} The ABS introduced a new method in 2009,{{sfn|ABoS 3302.0.55.003 \u2013 Life Tables|2009}} but problems remained.

This presents significant issues for employment. {{as of|2018}}, Indigenous students or adults, when compared with non-Indigenous peers:{{sfn|CtG Report|2019}}\n* Have a lower school attendance rate, with these rates at 82% and 93% respectively (in remote areas, as low as 63%)\n* Have lower literacy and numeracy, although rates had improved significantly on some [[NAPLAN]] (standardised school testing) measures\n* Reach [[Year 12]] at a lower rate, with improvement from 59% to 74% between 2006 and 2016, with the gap at 24% in 2016\n* Are underrepresented in [[higher education]] and have lower completion rates\n\nClosing the Gap has focused on improving education for Indigenous people, with some success. Attainment of Year 12 or equivalent for ages 20\u201324 has increased from 47.4% in 2006 to 65.3% in 2016. This has led to more Indigenous people undertaking higher or [[vocational education]] courses. According to the ''Closing the Gap'' report, Indigenous students in higher education award courses more than doubled in number over the decade from 2006 (9,329) to 2017 (19,237).{{sfn|CtG Report|2019}}\n\nHowever, most of the Closing the Gap targets for education are not on track. In general, the gaps have improved (such as in NAPLAN results) or not devolved (school attendance rate remaining stable for several years) have not met targets. Remoteness seems to be a factor; students in isolated or remote communities do not perform or attend as well as students in urban areas.{{sfn|OPMC Closing the Gap}} The ''Closing the Gap Report 2019'' reported that of the seven targets, only two \u2013 early childhood education and Year 12 attainment \u2013 had been met. Only Year 9 numeracy was on track in all states and territories, with variations among them.{{sfn|CtG Report|2019}}\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts]] was established as a training centre by the state and federal governments in 1997.\n\n=== Employment ===\nCompared to the national average, Indigenous people experience high unemployment and poverty rates. As of the ''2018 Closing the Gap Report'', the Indigenous employment rate had decreased from 48% to 46.6% between 2006 and 2016, while the non-Indigenous employment rate remained steady at around 72% (a 25.4% gap). The employment rate for Indigenous women, however, increased from 39% to 44.8% in the same period.{{sfn|IAA|2018}}\n\nA 2016 ABS report on labour force characteristics show low employment rates.{{sfn|ABoS 4714.0|2016}} An analysis of the figures suggested significant barriers to Indigenous people gaining employment, possibly including job location, employer discrimination, and lack of education and others. A big factor is education. Those with a [[academic degree|degree]] had an employment probability of 85% (for males) and 74% (for females) for gaining employment, decreasing along with qualifications, so that those who have completed Year 9 and below have a 43% (male) and 32% (female) probability of gaining employment. Other factors, unlike education, are not covered by government policy, such as discrimination and unfair treatment. Employed Indigenous Australians were more likely to experience discrimination than those who are unemployed, and it has been found that the second most common source of unfair treatment (after members of the public) is at work or applying for work. There was also a significant lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples on the methods they think best to tackle issues like unemployment.{{sfn|Biddle|Hunter|Yap|Gray}}\n\n=== Crime ===\n{{Main|Indigenous Australians and crime}}\n\nIndigenous Australians are over-represented in Australia's criminal justice system. {{As of| September 2019}}, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners represented 28% of the total adult prisoner population,{{sfn|ABoS|2019}} while accounting for 3.3% of the general population.{{sfn|ABoS|2016}} In May 2018, Indigenous women made up 34% of the prison population.{{sfn|AHRC|2018}} A 2017\u20132018 report into youth justice undertaken by the [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] reported that about half (a total of 2,339) of the young people aged 10\u201317 under supervision in 2016\u201317 were Indigenous, although of that age group, Indigenous youth represent 5% of the general population. It concludes from the data that there is a clear issue occurring not only within Australia's [[criminal justice system]], but within communities as a whole.{{sfn|AIHW Youth Justice|2018}}\n\nExplanations for this over-representation reflect the effect [[systemic racism]] has on the individual and the community, both historical (Stolen Generation) and recent. Whole communities have been traumatised, and other issues such as [[police brutality]], disconnection from land, and poor [[socioeconomic]] situation have contributed to the crime rate.{{sfn|Korff|2019a}}\n\nIndigenous Australians are also over-represented as [[victims of crime]], in particular, [[assault]]. Indigenous women are highly over-represented in this figure, accounting for a higher proportion of assault victims than the non-Indigenous category.{{sfn|ABoS Victims of Crime|2017}}\n\nIn 2007, the [[Northern Territory Government]] commissioned a [[Board of Inquiry]] into the Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse, which produced a report known as the ''[[Little Children are Sacred]]'' report. This suggested, based largely on [[anecdotal evidence]], that children in remote Aboriginal communities in NT were suffering from widespread [[sexual abuse]].{{sfn|Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle|2007}} The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]]'s ''Social Justice Report 2008''  said that the 2005\u22122006 ABS statistics did not appear to support the \"allegations of endemic child abuse...that was the rationale for the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response|NTER]]\" (\"The Intervention\" by the [[Howard government]]) that followed.{{sfn|AHRC|2008}}\n\n==Political issues==\n{{split section|Indigenous Australian politics|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Timeline===\nSince the 20th century there have been a number of individuals and organisations who have instigated significant events in the struggle for political representation, land rights and other political issues affecting the lives of Indigenous Australians:<ref name=smh2019>{{cite news | last=Chrysanthos | first=Natassia | title=What is the Uluru statement? | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=26 May 2019 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/what-is-the-uluru-statement-from-the-heart-20190523-p51qlj.html | access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref>\n*1937: [[Yorta Yorta]] man [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]] collects 1800 signatures to petition [[King George VI]] for representation of the original occupants of Australia in federal Parliament.\n*26 January ([[Australia Day]]) 1938: The [[Aborigines Progressive Association]] holds a [[Day of Mourning (Australia)|Day of Mourning]], to protest 150 years of callous treatment and the seizure of land.\n\n=== Political representation ===\n{{see also|Uluru Statement from the Heart|List of Indigenous Australian politicians|List of Indigenous Australians in politics and public service}}\n\nUnder Section 41 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], Aboriginal Australians always had the legal right to vote in Australian Commonwealth elections if their State granted them that right.

The 2012 Territory election saw large swings to the conservative Country Liberal Party in remote Territory electorates, and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly, along with one Labor candidate, in a chamber of 25 members. Among those elected for the CLP were high-profile activists [[Bess Price]] and [[Alison Anderson]].{{sfn|''The Australian''|2012}}\n\n40 people identifying themselves as of Indigenous Australian ancestry have been members of the ten Australian legislatures.

One suggestion for achieving this is to introduce [[Reserved political positions|seat quotas]], as in the [[Maori electorates]] in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn October 2007, just before the calling of a [[2007 Australian general election|federal election]], the then Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], revisited the idea of bringing a referendum to seek recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution (his government having previously sought to include recognition of Indigenous peoples in the [[Preamble]] to the Constitution in the [[1999 Australian republic referendum]]). His announcement was seen by some as a surprising adoption of the importance of the symbolic aspects of the reconciliation process, and reaction was mixed. The [[Australian Labor Party]] initially supported the idea; however [[Kevin Rudd]] withdrew this support just before the election, earning a rebuke from activist [[Noel Pearson]].{{sfn|''The Australian''|2007}}\n\nThe [[Gillard Government]] (2010\u20132013), with bi-partisan support, convened an expert panel to consider changes to the [[Australian Constitution]] that would see recognition for Indigenous Australians. The Government promised to hold a referendum on the constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians on or before the federal election due for 2013.{{sfn|Karvelas|2012}} The plan was abandoned in September 2012, with Minister [[Jenny Macklin]] citing insufficient community awareness for the decision.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn December 2015, the 16-member Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Referendum Council was jointly appointed by the Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and Leader of the Opposition, [[Bill Shorten]]. After six months of consultation, the First Nations National Constitutional Convention met over four days from 23 to 26 May 2017, and ratified the ''[[Uluru Statement from the Heart]]'' by a [[standing ovation]] from the gathering of 250 Indigenous leaders. The ''Statement'' calls for a \"First Nations Voice\" in the Australian Constitution and a \"Makarrata Commission\"<ref name=smh2019/> (''Makarrata'' is a [[Yolngu language|Yolngu]] word \"describing a process of conflict resolution, peacemaking and justice\").<ref>{{cite web |title=What is a Makarrata?

The majority in the High Court rejected the doctrine of ''terra nullius'', in favour of the concept of native title.{{sfn|ALII|1992}}\n\nIn 2013 an Indigenous group describing itself as the [[Murrawarri Republic]] declared independence from Australia, claiming territory straddling the border between the states of New South Wales and Queensland.{{sfn|Neubauer|2013}} Australia's Attorney General's Department indicated it did not consider the declaration to have any meaning in law.{{sfn|Neubauer|2013}}\n\nIn 2014 another Indigenous group describing itself as the [[Sovereign Yidindji Government]] declared independence from Australia.{{sfn|Howden|2015}}\n\nUnlike in other parts of the former [[British Empire]], like the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in New Zealand, no treaty has ever been concluded between Indigenous Australians and an Australian government. However, although there is still no move toward a treaty at federal level, it is contended that the Noongar Settlement (South West Native Title Settlement) in Western Australia in 2016 constitutes a treaty, and at the state and territory levels there are currently (early 2018) other negotiations and preparatory legislation.{{sfn|Hobbs|Williams|2018}} In [[South Australia]], however, following the [[2018 South Australian state election|2018 state election]] negotiations have been \"paused\".{{sfn|Wahlquist|2018}} In June 2018, the [[Parliament of Victoria]] passed a bill to advance the process of establishing a treaty with Aboriginal Victorians.{{sfn|Offer|2018}}\n\n== Prominent Indigenous Australians ==\n{{Main|Lists of Indigenous Australians}}\n\n[[File:Cathy400 mediafrenzy.jpg|thumb|[[Cathy Freeman]] surrounded by world media and carrying the [[Aboriginal flag|Aboriginal]] and [[Australian flag]]s following her victory in the 400&nbsp;m final of the [[Sydney Olympics]], 2000.]]\n[[File:ABC Sydney Olympics Freeman.ogv|thumb|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] footage and interviews of Australians celebrating Freeman's Olympics win \u2013 many noting how it brought the country together \"as one\".]]\n\nAfter the arrival of European settlers in New South Wales, some Indigenous Australians became translators and go-betweens; the best-known was [[Bennelong]], who eventually adopted European dress and customs and travelled to England where he was presented to [[King George III]]. Others, such as [[Pemulwuy]], [[Yagan]], and [[Windradyne]], became famous for armed resistance to the European settlers.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, as social attitudes shifted and interest in Indigenous culture increased, there were more opportunities for Indigenous Australians to gain recognition. [[Albert Namatjira]] became a painter, and actors such as [[David Gulpilil]], [[Ernie Dingo]], and [[Deborah Mailman]] became well known. Bands such as [[Yothu Yindi]], and singers [[Christine Anu]], [[Jessica Mauboy]] and [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]], have combined Indigenous musical styles and instruments with pop/rock, gaining appreciation amongst non-Indigenous audiences. Polymath [[David Unaipon]] is commemorated on the [[Banknotes of the Australian dollar|Australian $50 note]].\n\nWhile relatively few [[List of Indigenous Australian politicians|Indigenous Australians have been elected to political office]] ([[Neville Bonner]], [[Aden Ridgeway]], [[Ken Wyatt]], [[Nova Peris]], [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Linda Burney]] remain the only Indigenous Australians to have been elected to the [[Australian Federal Parliament]]), Aboriginal rights campaigner Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed Governor of the State of [[South Australia]] in 1976, and many others have become famous through political activism \u2013 for instance, [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]]' involvement in the [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|Freedom Ride]] of 1965 and subsequent work; or Torres Strait Islander [[Eddie Mabo]]'s part in the landmark [[native title]] decision that bears his name. The voices of Cape York activists [[Noel Pearson]] and [[Jean Aileen Little|Jean Little]], and academics [[Marcia Langton]] and [[Mick Dodson]], today loom large in national debates. Some Indigenous people who initially became famous in other spheres \u2013 for instance, poet [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] \u2013 have used their celebrity to draw attention to Indigenous issues.\n\nIn health services, [[Kelvin Kong]] became the first Indigenous surgeon in 2006 and is an advocate of Indigenous health issues.{{sfn|''The Australian''|2008}}{{sfn|ABC|2008}}{{sfn|ABC|2003}}{{sfn|''The Sydney Morning Herald''|2003}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Aboriginal deaths in custody]]\n* [[Aboriginal sites of New South Wales]]\n* [[Australian Aboriginal sacred sites]]\n* [[Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet]]\n* [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]]\n* [[Australian outback literature of the 20th century]]\n* [[Australo-Melanesian]]\n* [[Customary law in Australia]]\n* [[Indigenous Protected Area]]\n* [[IndigenousX]], media platform for Indigenous Australians \n* [[List of Indigenous Australian firsts]]\n* [[List of laws concerning Indigenous Australians]]\n* [[NAIDOC Week]]\n* [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]\n* [[Welcome to country]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=35em}}\n*{{Cite web| title = 1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia, 2002\n | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument\n | date = 25 January 2002\n | ref = {{harvid|ABoS|2002}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia, 2005\n | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/00000000000000000000000000000000/294322bc5648ead8ca256f7200833040!OpenDocument\n | date = 21 January 2005a\n | ref = {{harvid|ABoS|2005a}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 1370.0 \u2013 Measures of Australia's Progress, 2004\n | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/A03CAD8F1C3F813BCA256E7D00002641\n | date = 21 April 2004b | access-date = 12 October 2009\n | ref = {{harvid|ABoS|2004b}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 2020 Summiteer Dr Kelvin Kong \u2013 Life Matters\n | publisher = ABC | location = Australia\n | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/stories/2008/2176627.htm\n | date = 3 March 2008 | access-date = 27 June 2010\n | ref = {{harvid|ABC|2008}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 2071.0 -

They include the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples of Australia. The term '''Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people''' is preferred by many;{{efn|The use of Indigenous or Indigenous Australian is considered offensive by many, as being too generic; they prefer more specific terms for their unique cultural origins, or \"Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander\". {{harv|AIATSIS|2015}}}} '''First Nations of Australia''', '''First Peoples of Australia''' and '''First Australians''' are also increasingly common terms.\n\nThe time of arrival of the first peoples on the continent and nearby islands is a matter of debate among researchers. The earliest conclusively human remains found in Australia are those of [[Lake Mungo remains|Mungo Man LM3 and Mungo Lady]], which have been dated to around 50,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Bowler|Johnston|Olley|Prescott|2003}} Recent archaeological evidence from the analysis of charcoal and artefacts revealing human use suggests a date as early as 65,000 BP.{{sfn|Davidson|Wahlquist|2017}}{{sfn|Wright|2017}} [[Luminescence dating]] has suggested habitation in [[Arnhem Land]] as far back as 60,000 years BP.{{sfn|Bird|Turney|Fifield|Jones|2002|p=1074}} Evidence of fires in South-West Australia suggest \"human presence in Australia 120,000 years ago\", although more research is required.{{sfn|Carey|Sherwood|Price|Bowler|2018|pp=71\u201393}} Genetic research has inferred a date of habitation as early as 80,000 years BP. Other estimates have ranged up to 100,000 years{{sfn|Reyes-Centeno|Ghirotto|D\u00e9troit|Grimaud-Herv\u00e9|2014}} and 125,000 years BP.{{sfn|Bindon|1997|pp=173\u2013179}}\n\nThe population of Indigenous Australians at the time of permanent European settlement is contentious and has been estimated at between 318,000{{sfn|ABoS|2002}} and 1,000,000{{sfn|Gough|2011}} with the distribution being similar to that of the current Australian population, the majority living in the south-east, centred along the [[Murray River]].{{sfn|Pardoe|2006|pp=1\u201321}} A population collapse principally from disease followed European settlement,{{sfn|Ballyn|2011}}{{sfn|Glynn|Jenifer|2004|pp=145\u2013146}} beginning with a [[smallpox]] epidemic spreading three years after the arrival of Europeans. [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|Massacres]] and [[Australian frontier wars|frontier conflicts]] involving European settlers also contributed to depopulation.{{sfn|Evans|\u00d8rsted-Jensen|2014|p=28}}{{sfn|ABC News|2017}} The characterisation of this violence as [[genocide]] is controversial and disputed.{{sfn|Levene|2005|p=344 n.105}}\n\nAlthough there are a number of commonalities among the various Aboriginal peoples, there is also a great diversity among different communities and societies in Australia, each with its own mixture of cultures, customs and languages. In present-day Australia these groups are further divided into local communities.{{sfn|Hodge|1990}} At the time of initial European settlement, over 250 [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] were spoken; it is currently estimated that 120 to 145 of these remain in use, but only 13 of these are not considered endangered.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}{{sfn|AIATSIS|2014}} Aboriginal people today mostly speak English, with Aboriginal phrases and words being added to create [[Australian Aboriginal English]] (which also has a tangible influence of Indigenous languages in the phonology and grammatical structure).\n\nThe [[Australian Census]] includes counts of Indigenous peoples, based on questions relating to individuals' self-identification as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, or of both origins. {{As of|2016|6|30}}, the count was 798,365, or 3.3% of Australia's population.{{sfn|ABoS|2016}} Since 1995, the [[Australian Aboriginal flag]] and the [[Torres Strait Islander flag]] have been among the official [[List of Australian flags|flags of Australia]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Australian Aboriginal Flag.svg|thumb|Harold Thomas' Australian Aboriginal Flag]]\n\n===Variations===\nThere is a number of appropriate terms to use when referring to Indigenous peoples of Australia, but there is general agreement that it is important to respect the \"preferences of individuals, families, or communities, and allow them to define what they are most comfortable with\" when referring to Indigenous people.{{sfn|Common Ground}}\n\nThe word [[wikt:aboriginal|aboriginal]] has been in the English language since at least the 16th century to mean, \"first or earliest known, indigenous\". It comes from the Latin word ''aborigines'', derived from ''ab'' (from) and ''origo'' (origin, beginning).{{sfn|Aborigine \u2013 Definition|2012}} The term was used in Australia to describe its [[Indigenous peoples]] as early as 1789. It became capitalised and was employed as the common name to refer to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, although today the latter are not included in the term. The term \"Aborigine\" is deprecated, being regarded as outdated and inappropriate, having connotations of [[colonial Australia]].{{sfn|Common Ground}}{{sfn|Appropriate words & terminology}}\n\nWhile the term \"Indigenous Australians\" has grown since the 1980s,{{sfn|Flinders University|1996}} many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples dislike it, feeling that it is too generic and removes their identity.

Between 1860 and 1970, under the guise of protectionist policies, people, including children as young as 12, were forced to work on properties where they worked under horrific conditions and most did not receive any wages.{{sfn|Simmonds|2015}} In the [[pearl hunting|pearling]] industry, Aboriginal peoples were bought for about 5 pounds, with pregnant Aboriginal women \"prized because their lungs were believed to have greater air capacity\"{{sfn|Korff|2018b}} Aboriginal prisoners in the Aboriginal-only prison on [[Rottnest Island]], many of whom were there on trumped up charges, were chained up and forced to work.{{sfn|Murphy|2017}} In 1971, 373 Aboriginal men were found buried in unmarked graves on the island.{{sfn|Melville|2016}} Up until June 2018, the former prison was being used as holiday accommodation.{{sfn|Wynne|2018}}\n\nFrom 1810, Aboriginal peoples were moved onto mission stations, run by churches and the state.{{sfn|Korff|2018a}} While they provided food and shelter, their purpose was to \"civilise\" Aboriginal communities by teaching western values. After this period of protectionist policies that aimed to segregate and control Aboriginal populations, in 1937 the Commonwealth government agreed to move towards assimilation policies. These policies aimed to integrate Aboriginal persons who were \"not of full blood\" into the white community in an effort to eliminate the \"Aboriginal problem\". As part of this, there was an increase in the number of children forcibly removed from their homes and placed with white people, either in institutions or foster homes.{{sfn|''Face the Facts''|2005}}\n\n====Frontier Wars====\n{{main|Australian frontier wars|List of massacres of Indigenous Australians}}\nAs part of the colonisation process, there were many small-scale conflicts and clashes between colonists and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across the continent and islands. In Queensland, the killing of Aboriginal peoples was largely perpetrated by civilian \"hunting\" parties and the Native Police, armed groups of Aboriginal men who were recruited at gunpoint and led by colonialist to eliminate Aboriginal resistance.{{sfn|Richards|2014|pp=147\u2013161}} There is evidence that massacres of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, which began with arrival of British colonists, continued until the 1930s.

The ruling was a three-part definition comprising descent, self-identification and community identification. The first part \u2013 descent \u2013 was genetic descent and unambiguous, but led to cases where a lack of records to prove ancestry excluded some.

The size of the excluded population was generally separately estimated. \"Half-caste aboriginal natives\" were shown separately up to the 1966 census, but since 1971 there has been no provision on the forms to differentiate \"full\" from \"part\" Indigenous or to identify non-Indigenous persons who are accepted by Indigenous communities but have no genetic descent.{{sfn|Gardiner-Garden|2000}}\n\nAs there is no formal procedure for any community to record acceptance, the primary method of determining Indigenous population is from self-identification on census forms.\nThe [[Australian Census]] includes counts based on questions relating to individuals' self-identification as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, or of both origins.{{sfn|ABoS|2016}} Owing to various difficulties which lead to under-counting, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) follows a set method to estimate total numbers.{{sfn|ABS tech note|2018}}\n\n==== Distribution and growth ====\n{{see also|Australian Aboriginal identity}}{{hatnote|See Infobox above for Distribution by state & territory}}\nThe 2006 [[Australian census]] showed growth in the Indigenous population (recorded as 517,000) at twice the rate of overall population growth since 1996, when the Indigenous population stood at 283,000.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In the [[2011 Australian Census|2011 census]], there was a 20% rise in people who identify as Aboriginal.{{sfn|SBS|2012}} In the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], there was another 18.4% rise on the 2011 figure. 590,056 respondents identified themselves as Aboriginal, 32,345 [[Torres Strait Islander]], and a further 26,767 both Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].{{sfn|ABoS Census|2017}}\n\nGrowth was mainly in major cities and along the eastern coast of Australia. The ABS published a report exploring the reasons for these findings, with some of the factors behind the increase being higher fertility rates of Indigenous women; people entering the population through migration; variation in census coverage and response rates; and people changing how they self-identify between census years.{{sfn|ABS increase|2018}} Another factor might be the children of mixed marriages: the proportion of Aboriginal adults married (''de facto'' or ''[[de jure]]'') to non-Aboriginal spouses increased to 78.2% in the 2016 census,{{sfn|ABoS 2077.0|2018}} (up from 74% in 2011,{{sfn|ABoS 2077.0}} 64% in 1996, 51% in 1991 and 46% in 1986); it was reported in 2002 that up to 88% of the offspring of mixed marriages subsequently self-identify as Indigenous Australians.{{sfn|Greg Gardiner|2002}}\n\nIn the 2016, over 33% of the Indigenous population lived in major cities, compared with about 75% of the non-Indigenous population, with a further 24% in \"inner regional\" areas (compared with 18%), 20% in \"outer regional\" (8%), while nearly 18% lived in \"remote\" or \"very remote\" areas (2%).{{sfn|ABoS 3238.0|2018}} (Ten years earlier, 31% were living in major cities and 24% in remote areas.{{sfn|ABoS \u2013 population|2006}})\n\n== Languages ==\n===Aboriginal languages===\n{{Main|Australian Aboriginal English|Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal sign languages}}\nAccording to the 2005 National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS), at the time the Australian continent was colonised, there were around 250 different Indigenous languages, with the larger language groups each having up to 100 related dialects.{{sfn|AIATSIS & FATSIL|2005}} Some of these languages were only ever spoken by perhaps 50 to 100 people. Indigenous languages are divided into language groups with from ten to twenty-four language families identified.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}} It is currently estimated that up to 145 Indigenous languages remain in use, of which fewer than 20 are considered to be strong in the sense that they are still spoken by all age groups.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}{{sfn|Zuckermann|2009}} All but 13 Indigenous languages are considered to be endangered.{{sfn|AIATSIS|2014}} Several extinct Indigenous languages are being reconstructed. For example, the last fluent speaker of the [[Ngarrindjeri language]] died in the late 1960s; using recordings and written records as a guide, a Ngarrindjeri dictionary was published in 2009,{{sfn|UniSA|2008}} and the Ngarrindjeri language is today being spoken in complete sentences.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}\n\nLinguists classify many of the mainland Australian languages into one large group, the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages]]. The rest are sometimes lumped under the term \"non-Pama\u2013Nyungan\". The Pama\u2013Nyungan languages comprise the majority, covering most of Australia, and are generally thought to be a family of related languages. In the north, stretching from the Western [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], are found a number of non-Pama\u2013Nyungan groups of languages which have not been shown to be related to the Pama\u2013Nyungan family nor to each other.{{sfn|Evans|2003}} While it has sometimes proven difficult to work out familial relationships within the Pama\u2013Nyungan language family, many Australian linguists feel there has been substantial success.{{sfn|Bowern|Harold|2004}} Against this, some linguists, such as [[R. M. W. Dixon]], suggest that the Pama\u2013Nyungan group \u2013 and indeed the entire Australian linguistic area \u2013 is rather a ''[[sprachbund]]'', or group of languages having very long and intimate contact, rather than a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] language family.{{sfn|Dixon|1997}}\n\nIt has been suggested that, given their long presence in Australia, Aboriginal languages form one specific sub-grouping. The position of Tasmanian languages is unknown, and it is also unknown whether they comprised one or more than one specific language family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Cross-cultural communications====\nCross-cultural miscommunication can sometimes occur between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Western conversational interaction is typically \"[[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]]\", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and \"contained\" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Aboriginal conversational interaction is \"communal\", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and \"continuous\", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.{{sfn|Zuckermann|2015|p=12}}{{sfn|Walsh|1997|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n===Torres Strait Island languages===\n{{main|Torres Strait Island languages}}\nThere are three languages spoken in the [[Torres Strait Islands]], two indigenous languages and an English-based creole.  The indigenous language spoken mainly in the western and central islands is [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]], a language related to the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages]] of the Australian mainland. The other indigenous language spoken mainly in the eastern islands is [[Meriam language|Meriam Mir]]: a member of the [[Trans-Fly languages]] spoken on the nearby south coast of New Guinea and the only [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken on Australian territory. Both languages are [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]]; however Kalaw Lagaw Ya appears to be undergoing a transition into a [[declension]]al language while Meriam M\u00ecr is more clearly agglutinative. [[Torres Strait Creole|Yumplatok]], or Torres Strait Creole, the third language, is a non-typical Pacific English Creole and is the main language of communication on the islands.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Belief systems ==\n[[File:William BARAK - Wurundjeri people - Corroboree - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a [[corroboree]] by 19th century Indigenous activist [[William Barak]]]]\n\n===Traditional beliefs===\n====Aboriginal====\n{{further|Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology}}\nWithin Aboriginal belief systems, a formative epoch known as \"the [[Dreamtime]]\" or \"the Dreaming\" stretches back into the distant past when the creator ancestors known as the First Peoples travelled across the land, and naming as they went. Indigenous Australia's [[oral tradition]] and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this Dreamtime.{{sfn|Andrews|2004|p=424}} The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. Different language and cultural groups each had their own belief structures; these cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. Major [[ancestral]] spirits include the [[Rainbow Serpent]], [[Baiame]], [[Dirawong]] and [[Bunjil]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Knowledge contained in the Dreaming has been passed down through different stories, [[songline]]s, dances and ceremonies, and even today provides a framework for ongoing relationships, [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship responsibilities]] and looking after country.{{sfn|WVA - 8 interesting facts}}\n\nTraditional healers (known as [[Ngangkari]] in the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western desert]] areas of Central Australia) were highly respected men and women who not only acted as healers or doctors, but were generally also custodians of important Dreaming stories.{{sfn|Traditional Healers|2013|pp=15\u201319}}\n\n====Torres Strait Islander====\n{{further||Torres Strait Islanders#Religion and beliefs}}\nTorres Strait Islander people have their own traditional belief systems.

As in many [[colonialism|colonial]] situations, the churches both facilitated the loss of Indigenous culture and religion and also facilitated its maintenance.{{sfn|Mundine|2005}} In some cases, such as at [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory]] and [[Piltawodli]] in Adelaide, the work of missionaries laid the foundations for later [[language revival]]. The German missionaries [[Christian Teichelmann]] and [[Clamor Sch\u00fcrmann|Sch\u00fcrmann]] went to [[Adelaide]] and taught the local [[Kaurna]] people only in [[Kaurna language|their own language]] and created textbooks in the language.{{sfn|Lockwood|2017|pp=65\u201381}}{{sfn|Amery}} However, some [[missionaries]] taught only in English, and some [[Christian mission]]s were involved in the placement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children after they were removed from their parents upon orders of the government, and are therefore implicated in the [[Stolen Generations]].\n\n====Aboriginal peoples====\nThe involvement of Christians in Aboriginal affairs has evolved significantly since 1788.{{sfn|Mundine|2005}} The Churches became involved in mission work among Aboriginal peoples in the 19th century as Europeans came to control much of the continent, and the majority of the population was eventually converted. Colonial clergy such as Sydney's first Catholic archbishop, [[John Bede Polding]], strongly advocated for Aboriginal rights and dignity.{{sfn|O'Sullivan}} Around the year 2000, many churches and church organisations officially apologised for past failures to adequately respect Indigenous cultures and address the injustices of the dispossession of Indigenous people.{{sfn|Mundine|2005}}{{sfn|Anglican Church|2005}}\n\nA small minority of Aboriginal people are [[Islam in Australia#Aboriginal Muslims|followers of Islam]]<!--see Talk#Religious beliefs \u2013 Islam?--> as a result of intermarriage with [[Afghan cameleers in Australia|\"Afghan\" camel drivers]] brought to Australia in the late 19th and early 20th century to help explore and open up the interior.{{sfn|Mercer|2003}}\n\n====Torres Strait Islander peoples====\nFrom the 1870s, [[Christianity]] spread throughout the Torres Strait Islands, and it remains strong today among Torres Strait Islander people everywhere. The [[London Missionary Society]] mission led by Rev. Samuel Macfarlane arrived on [[Darnley Island, Torres Strait|Erub (Darnley Island)]] on 1 July 1871, establishing its first base in the region there. The Islanders refer to this as \"The Coming of the Light\", or \"Coming of Light\"{{sfn|Korff|2019b}} and all Island communities celebrate the occasion annually on 1 July.{{sfn|TSRA - history}} However the coming of Christianity did not spell the end of the people's traditional beliefs; their culture informed their understanding of the new religion, as the [[Christian God]] was welcomed and the new religion was integrated into every aspect of their everyday lives.{{sfn|Korff|2019b}}\n\n===Recent census figures===\nIn the 2016 Census, Australia's Indigenous and non-Indigenous population were broadly similar with 54% (vs 55%) reporting a [[Christianity in Australia|Christian]] affiliation, while less than 2% reported traditional beliefs as their religion, and 36% reported no religion. The proportion of Indigenous people who reported no religion has increased gradually since 2001, standing at 36% in 2016. According to \"Table 8: Religious Affiliation by Indigenous Status\", 347,572 Indigenous people (out of the total 649,171 in Australia) declared an affiliation to some form of Christianity, with a higher proportion of Torres Strait Islander than Aboriginal people in this number. 7,773 reported traditional beliefs; 1,511 Islam; other religions numbered less than 1,000 each.

Perhaps the most documented is a game popularly played by tribes in western [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] regions of the [[Wimmera]], [[Mallee (Victoria)|Mallee]] and [[Millewa]] by the [[Djab wurrung]], [[Jardwadjali]] and [[Jarijari]] people. Known as [[Marn Grook]], it was a type of kick and catch football game played with a ball made of [[Phalangeridae|possum]] hide.{{sfn|Farnsworth|2007}} According to some accounts, it was played as far away as the [[Yarra Valley]] by the [[Wurundjeri]] people,{{sfn|Ellender|Christiansen|2001|p=45}} [[Gippsland]] by the [[Gunai people|Gunai]] people, and the [[Riverina]] in south-western [[New South Wales]]. Some historians claim that Marn Grook had a role in the formation of [[Australian rules football]], and many Aboriginal people, from children in remote communities to professional players at the highest level, the [[Australian Football League]], play the modern game.

Not only were many of the [[child abuse|children abused]] \u2013 [[psychological abuse|psychologically]], [[physical abuse|physically]], or [[sexual abuse|sexually]] \u2013 after being removed and while living in group homes or adoptive families, but were also deprived of their culture alongside their families.{{sfn|Australians Together}} This has resulted in the disruption of [[oral history|oral culture]], as parents were unable to communicate their knowledge to their children, and thus much has been lost.{{sfn|Australians Together}}\n\nThere are many issues facing Indigenous people in Australia today when compared with the non-Indigenous population, despite some improvements. Several of these are interrelated, and include health (including shorter [[life expectancy]] and higher rates of [[infant mortality]]), lower levels of education and employment, inter-generational trauma, high [[Indigenous Australians and crime|imprisonment rates]], [[substance abuse]] and lack of political representation.{{sfn|Australians Together}}\n\nSome demographic facts are related to these issues, as cause and/or result:\n\n* In the [[2016 Australian Census]], over 33% of the Indigenous population lived in major cities, compared with about 75% of the non-Indigenous population, with a further 24% in \"inner regional\" areas (compared with 18%), 20% in \"outer regional\" (8%), while nearly 18% lived in \"remote\" or \"very remote\" areas (2%).{{sfn|ABoS 3238.0|2018}}\n* The Indigenous population of Australia is much younger than the non-Indigenous population, with an estimated [[median age]] of 21 years (37 years for non-Indigenous), due to higher rates of birth and death.{{sfn|ABoS|2008}} For this reason, [[age adjustment|age standardisation]] is often used when comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous statistics.{{sfn|ABoS|2005a}}\n\nThe federal government's [[Closing the Gap]] strategy, created in 2008 and coordinated by the [[National Indigenous Australians Agency]] since July 2019, aims to address multiple areas to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples. Draft targets for 2019 were created by the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG) in December 2018. These were in the following areas:{{sfn|NIAA|2018}}\n* families, children and youth\n* health\n* education\n* economic development\n* housing\n* justice (including [[Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory|youth justice]])\n* land and water, \"where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' land, water and cultural rights are realised\"\n* cross-system priorities, which \"addresses racism, discrimination and social inclusion, healing and trauma, and the promotion of culture and language for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\"\n\n=== Health ===\n{{see also|Indigenous health in Australia}}\n\nSocial and cultural determinants such as [[racism|discrimination]], lack of education or employment (and therefore [[income]]), and cultural disconnection can impact both physical and mental health, and contemporary disadvantage is related to colonisation and its ongoing impact.{{sfn|Australians Together|2014}}{{sfn|Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|2019}}\n\nSuccessive censuses have shown, that (after adjusting for demographic structures) Indigenous Australians experience greater rates of [[renal disease]], several [[communicable diseases]] (such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[hepatitis C virus]]), [[type 2 diabetes]], [[respiratory disease]], poor [[mental health]] and other illnesses than the general population.{{sfn|Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|2019}}{{sfn|ABoS|2005a}}\n\n====Life expectancy====\nThe life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is difficult to quantify accurately. Indigenous deaths are poorly identified, and the official figures for the size of the population at risk include large adjustment factors. Two estimates of Indigenous life expectancy in 2008 differed by as much as five years.{{sfn|''National Indigenous Times''|2008}} The ABS introduced a new method in 2009,{{sfn|ABoS 3302.0.55.003 \u2013 Life Tables|2009}} but problems remained. A 2013 study, referring to the national Indigenous reform policy, Closing the Gap, looked at the difficulties in interpreting the extent of the gap because of differing methods of estimating life expectancy between 2007 and 2012.{{efn|\"A specific estimate of the life expectancy gap has not been established among stakeholders in Indigenous health. Agreement on the magnitude of the gap is arguably needed in order to evaluate strategies aimed at improving health outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Moreover, measuring progress towards 'closing the gap' depends on the availability of comparable estimates, using the same techniques of measurement to assess changes over time.\" {{harvcol|Rosenstock|Mukandi|Zwi|Hill|2013|pp=356\u201364}}}} The 2019 report by the Close the Gap campaign reported that the gap in life expectancy was \"widening rather than closing\".{{sfn|AHRC|2019}}\n\nInfant mortality (ages 0\u20134) was twice as high as for non-Indigenous children in 2014\u20136.{{sfn|Australians Together|2014}}\n\n====Mental health====\n[[Mental health]], [[suicide]] and [[self-harm]] remain major concerns, with the suicide rate being double that of the non-Indigenous population in 2015, and young people experiencing rising mental health rates.{{sfn|Australians Together|2014}} There are high incidences of [[anxiety]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[PTSD]] and suicide amongst the [[Stolen Generations]], with this resulting in unstable parenting and family situations.{{sfn|Australians Together}}\n\n==== Substance abuse ====\nMany Indigenous communities suffer from a range of health, social and legal problems associated with [[substance abuse]] of both legal and illegal drugs, including but not limited to [[alcohol abuse]], [[petrol sniffing]], the use illegal drugs such as [[methamphetamine]] (\"ice\") and [[cannabis]] and [[smoking tobacco]].{{sfn|Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|2019}} Tobacco use has been estimated to be the \"greatest contributor (23%) to the gap in the disease burden between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians\", with Indigenous people more than 2.5% likely to smoke daily than non-Indigenous Australians.{{sfn|AG.DoH|2017}}\n\nIndigenous Australians were 1.6 times as likely to [[teetotaller|abstain completely from alcohol]] than non-Indigenous people in 2012\u20133. [[Foetal alcohol syndrome]] has been a problem, but the rate of pregnant women drinking had halved between 2008 and 2015 (from 20% to 10%).{{sfn|Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|2019}}\n\n[[Petrol sniffing in Australia|Petrol sniffing]] has been a problem among some remote communities.{{sfn|LAoNT|2004}} A 2018 [[longitudinal study]] by the [[University of Queensland]] (UQ), commissioned by the [[National Indigenous Australians Agency]],{{efn|On 1 July 2019 the Indigenous Affairs portfolio was moved through a Machinery of Government change to form the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA).}} reported that the number of people sniffing petrol in the 25 communities studied had declined by 95.2%, from 453 to just 22, related to the distribution of a new, low aromatic petrol, [[Opal (fuel)|Opal]], in NT in 2005.{{sfn|Australian Government|2006b}}{{sfn|Dovetail|2019}}{{sfn|d'Abbs|Gillick|Hodson|Kavanagh|2019}}{{sfn|Ministers Media Centre|2019}}\n\nThe 2018 UQ study also reported that alcohol and cannabis were the drugs causing most concern. Ice was reported present in 8 of the 25 communities, but nearly all only occasional use.{{sfn|d'Abbs|Gillick|Hodson|Kavanagh|2019}}{{efn|\"A report for the National Indigenous Australians Agency, Health and Wellbeing Branch\" {{harvcol|d'Abbs|Gillick|Hodson|Kavanagh|2019}}}}\n\n=== Education ===\n{{further|Closing the Gap|National Sorry Day#Close the Gap}}\nThere is a significant gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in educational attainment. This presents significant issues for employment. {{as of|2018}}, Indigenous students or adults, when compared with non-Indigenous peers:{{sfn|CtG Report|2019}}\n* Have a lower school attendance rate, with these rates at 82% and 93% respectively (in remote areas, as low as 63%)\n* Have lower literacy and numeracy, although rates had improved significantly on some [[NAPLAN]] (standardised school testing) measures\n* Reach [[Year 12]] at a lower rate, with improvement from 59% to 74% between 2006 and 2016, with the gap at 24% in 2016\n* Are underrepresented in [[higher education]] and have lower completion rates\n\nClosing the Gap has focused on improving education for Indigenous people, with some success. Attainment of Year 12 or equivalent for ages 20\u201324 has increased from 47.4% in 2006 to 65.3% in 2016. This has led to more Indigenous people undertaking higher or [[vocational education]] courses. According to the ''Closing the Gap'' report, Indigenous students in higher education award courses more than doubled in number over the decade from 2006 (9,329) to 2017 (19,237).{{sfn|CtG Report|2019}}\n\nHowever, most of the Closing the Gap targets for education are not on track. In general, the gaps have improved (such as in NAPLAN results) or not devolved (school attendance rate remaining stable for several years) have not met targets. Remoteness seems to be a factor; students in isolated or remote communities do not perform or attend as well as students in urban areas.{{sfn|OPMC Closing the Gap}} The ''Closing the Gap Report 2019'' reported that of the seven targets, only two \u2013 early childhood education and Year 12 attainment \u2013 had been met. Only Year 9 numeracy was on track in all states and territories, with variations among them.{{sfn|CtG Report|2019}}\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts]] was established as a training centre by the state and federal governments in 1997.\n\n=== Employment ===\nCompared to the national average, Indigenous people experience high unemployment and poverty rates. As of the ''2018 Closing the Gap Report'', the Indigenous employment rate had decreased from 48% to 46.6% between 2006 and 2016, while the non-Indigenous employment rate remained steady at around 72% (a 25.4% gap). The employment rate for Indigenous women, however, increased from 39% to 44.8% in the same period.{{sfn|IAA|2018}}\n\nA 2016 ABS report on labour force characteristics show low employment rates.{{sfn|ABoS 4714.0|2016}} An analysis of the figures suggested significant barriers to Indigenous people gaining employment, possibly including job location, employer discrimination, and lack of education and others. A big factor is education. Those with a [[academic degree|degree]] had an employment probability of 85% (for males) and 74% (for females) for gaining employment, decreasing along with qualifications, so that those who have completed Year 9 and below have a 43% (male) and 32% (female) probability of gaining employment. Other factors, unlike education, are not covered by government policy, such as discrimination and unfair treatment. Employed Indigenous Australians were more likely to experience discrimination than those who are unemployed, and it has been found that the second most common source of unfair treatment (after members of the public) is at work or applying for work. There was also a significant lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples on the methods they think best to tackle issues like unemployment.{{sfn|Biddle|Hunter|Yap|Gray}}\n\n=== Crime ===\n{{Main|Indigenous Australians and crime}}\n\nIndigenous Australians are over-represented in Australia's criminal justice system. {{As of| September 2019}}, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners represented 28% of the total adult prisoner population,{{sfn|ABoS|2019}} while accounting for 3.3% of the general population.{{sfn|ABoS|2016}} In May 2018, Indigenous women made up 34% of the prison population.{{sfn|AHRC|2018}} A 2017\u20132018 report into youth justice undertaken by the [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] reported that about half (a total of 2,339) of the young people aged 10\u201317 under supervision in 2016\u201317 were Indigenous, although of that age group, Indigenous youth represent 5% of the general population. It concludes from the data that there is a clear issue occurring not only within Australia's [[criminal justice system]], but within communities as a whole.{{sfn|AIHW Youth Justice|2018}}\n\nExplanations for this over-representation reflect the effect [[systemic racism]] has on the individual and the community, both historical (Stolen Generation) and recent. Whole communities have been traumatised, and other issues such as [[police brutality]], disconnection from land, and poor [[socioeconomic]] situation have contributed to the crime rate.{{sfn|Korff|2019a}}\n\nIndigenous Australians are also over-represented as [[victims of crime]], in particular, [[assault]]. Indigenous women are highly over-represented in this figure, accounting for a higher proportion of assault victims than the non-Indigenous category.{{sfn|ABoS Victims of Crime|2017}}\n\nIn 2007, the [[Northern Territory Government]] commissioned a [[Board of Inquiry]] into the Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse, which produced a report known as the ''[[Little Children are Sacred]]'' report. This suggested, based largely on [[anecdotal evidence]], that children in remote Aboriginal communities in NT were suffering from widespread [[sexual abuse]].{{sfn|Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle|2007}} The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]]'s ''Social Justice Report 2008''  said that the 2005\u22122006 ABS statistics did not appear to support the \"allegations of endemic child abuse...that was the rationale for the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response|NTER]]\" (\"The Intervention\" by the [[Howard government]]) that followed.{{sfn|AHRC|2008}}\n\n==Political issues==\n{{split section|Indigenous Australian politics|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Timeline===\nSince the 20th century there have been a number of individuals and organisations who have instigated significant events in the struggle for political representation, land rights and other political issues affecting the lives of Indigenous Australians:<ref name=smh2019>{{cite news | last=Chrysanthos | first=Natassia | title=What is the Uluru statement? | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=26 May 2019 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/what-is-the-uluru-statement-from-the-heart-20190523-p51qlj.html | access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref>\n*1937: [[Yorta Yorta]] man [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]] collects 1800 signatures to petition [[King George VI]] for representation of the original occupants of Australia in federal Parliament.\n*26 January ([[Australia Day]]) 1938: The [[Aborigines Progressive Association]] holds a [[Day of Mourning (Australia)|Day of Mourning]], to protest 150 years of callous treatment and the seizure of land.\n\n=== Political representation ===\n{{see also|Uluru Statement from the Heart|List of Indigenous Australian politicians|List of Indigenous Australians in politics and public service}}\n\nUnder Section 41 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], Aboriginal Australians always had the legal right to vote in Australian Commonwealth elections if their State granted them that right. This meant that all Aboriginal peoples outside Queensland and Western Australia had a legal right to vote. The right of Indigenous ex-servicemen to vote was affirmed in 1949 and all Indigenous Australians gained the unqualified right to vote in Federal elections in 1962.{{sfn|AEC|2007}} Unlike other Australians, however, voting was not made compulsory for Indigenous people, and it was not until the repeal of [[Section 127 of the Constitution of Australia]] following the [[1967 Australian referendum (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] that Indigenous Australians were counted in the population for the purposes of distribution of electoral seats.\n\n{{as of |January 2020}}, six Indigenous Australians have been elected to the [[Australian Senate]]: [[Neville Bonner]] (Liberal, 1971\u20131983), [[Aden Ridgeway]] (Democrat, 1999\u20132005), [[Nova Peris]] (Labor, 2013\u20132016), [[Jacqui Lambie]] (2014\u20132017, 2019\u2013''incumbent''), [[Pat Dodson]] (Labor, 2016\u2013 ''incumbent''), and former [[Northern Territory]] MLA [[Malarndirri McCarthy]] (Labor, 2016\u2013 ''incumbent'').\n\nFollowing the [[2010 Australian Federal Election]], [[Ken Wyatt]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] won the Western Australian seat of Hasluck, becoming the first Indigenous person elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Ker|2010}}{{sfn|BBC|2010}} His nephew, [[Ben Wyatt]], was concurrently serving as Shadow Treasurer in the [[Western Australian Parliament]] and in 2011 considered a challenge for the Labor Party leadership in that state.{{sfn|Lloyd|2011}} [[Linda Burney]] became the second Indigenous person, and the first woman, to serve in the federal House of Representatives.\n\nIn March 2013, [[Adam Giles]] of the [[Country Liberal Party]] became [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]] \u2013 the first Indigenous Australian to become head of government in a state or territory of Australia.{{sfn|ABC News|2013}}\n\nA number of Indigenous people represent electorates at state and territory level, and [[South Australia]] has had an Aboriginal Governor, Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]].

[[Carol Martin (politician)|Carol Martin]] was the first Aboriginal woman elected to an Australian parliament (the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]) in 2001, and the first woman minister was [[Marion Scrymgour]], who was appointed to the Northern Territory ministry in 2002 (she became Deputy Chief Minister in 2008).{{sfn|AEC|2007}} Representation in the Northern Territory has been relatively high, reflecting the high proportion of Aboriginal voters. The 2012 Territory election saw large swings to the conservative Country Liberal Party in remote Territory electorates, and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly, along with one Labor candidate, in a chamber of 25 members. Among those elected for the CLP were high-profile activists [[Bess Price]] and [[Alison Anderson]].{{sfn|''The Australian''|2012}}\n\n40 people identifying themselves as of Indigenous Australian ancestry have been members of the ten Australian legislatures. Of these, 22 have been in the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]]. The [[Northern Territory]] has an exceptionally high Indigenous proportion (about one third) of its population.

His announcement was seen by some as a surprising adoption of the importance of the symbolic aspects of the reconciliation process, and reaction was mixed. The [[Australian Labor Party]] initially supported the idea; however [[Kevin Rudd]] withdrew this support just before the election, earning a rebuke from activist [[Noel Pearson]].{{sfn|''The Australian''|2007}}\n\nThe [[Gillard Government]] (2010\u20132013), with bi-partisan support, convened an expert panel to consider changes to the [[Australian Constitution]] that would see recognition for Indigenous Australians.

The majority in the High Court rejected the doctrine of ''terra nullius'', in favour of the concept of native title.{{sfn|ALII|1992}}\n\nIn 2013 an Indigenous group describing itself as the [[Murrawarri Republic]] declared independence from Australia, claiming territory straddling the border between the states of New South Wales and Queensland.{{sfn|Neubauer|2013}} Australia's Attorney General's Department indicated it did not consider the declaration to have any meaning in law.{{sfn|Neubauer|2013}}\n\nIn 2014 another Indigenous group describing itself as the [[Sovereign Yidindji Government]] declared independence from Australia.{{sfn|Howden|2015}}\n\nUnlike in other parts of the former [[British Empire]], like the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in New Zealand, no treaty has ever been concluded between Indigenous Australians and an Australian government. However, although there is still no move toward a treaty at federal level, it is contended that the Noongar Settlement (South West Native Title Settlement) in Western Australia in 2016 constitutes a treaty, and at the state and territory levels there are currently (early 2018) other negotiations and preparatory legislation.{{sfn|Hobbs|Williams|2018}} In [[South Australia]], however, following the [[2018 South Australian state election|2018 state election]] negotiations have been \"paused\".{{sfn|Wahlquist|2018}} In June 2018, the [[Parliament of Victoria]] passed a bill to advance the process of establishing a treaty with Aboriginal Victorians.{{sfn|Offer|2018}}\n\n== Prominent Indigenous Australians ==\n{{Main|Lists of Indigenous Australians}}\n\n[[File:Cathy400 mediafrenzy.jpg|thumb|[[Cathy Freeman]] surrounded by world media and carrying the [[Aboriginal flag|Aboriginal]] and [[Australian flag]]s following her victory in the 400&nbsp;m final of the [[Sydney Olympics]], 2000.]]\n[[File:ABC Sydney Olympics Freeman.ogv|thumb|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] footage and interviews of Australians celebrating Freeman's Olympics win \u2013 many noting how it brought the country together \"as one\".]]\n\nAfter the arrival of European settlers in New South Wales, some Indigenous Australians became translators and go-betweens; the best-known was [[Bennelong]], who eventually adopted European dress and customs and travelled to England where he was presented to [[King George III]]. Others, such as [[Pemulwuy]], [[Yagan]], and [[Windradyne]], became famous for armed resistance to the European settlers.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, as social attitudes shifted and interest in Indigenous culture increased, there were more opportunities for Indigenous Australians to gain recognition. [[Albert Namatjira]] became a painter, and actors such as [[David Gulpilil]], [[Ernie Dingo]], and [[Deborah Mailman]] became well known. Bands such as [[Yothu Yindi]], and singers [[Christine Anu]], [[Jessica Mauboy]] and [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]], have combined Indigenous musical styles and instruments with pop/rock, gaining appreciation amongst non-Indigenous audiences. Polymath [[David Unaipon]] is commemorated on the [[Banknotes of the Australian dollar|Australian $50 note]].\n\nWhile relatively few [[List of Indigenous Australian politicians|Indigenous Australians have been elected to political office]] ([[Neville Bonner]], [[Aden Ridgeway]], [[Ken Wyatt]], [[Nova Peris]], [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Linda Burney]] remain the only Indigenous Australians to have been elected to the [[Australian Federal Parliament]]), Aboriginal rights campaigner Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed Governor of the State of [[South Australia]] in 1976, and many others have become famous through political activism \u2013 for instance, [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]]' involvement in the [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|Freedom Ride]] of 1965 and subsequent work; or Torres Strait Islander [[Eddie Mabo]]'s part in the landmark [[native title]] decision that bears his name. The voices of Cape York activists [[Noel Pearson]] and [[Jean Aileen Little|Jean Little]], and academics [[Marcia Langton]] and [[Mick Dodson]], today loom large in national debates. Some Indigenous people who initially became famous in other spheres \u2013 for instance, poet [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] \u2013 have used their celebrity to draw attention to Indigenous issues.\n\nIn health services, [[Kelvin Kong]] became the first Indigenous surgeon in 2006 and is an advocate of Indigenous health issues.{{sfn|''The Australian''|2008}}{{sfn|ABC|2008}}{{sfn|ABC|2003}}{{sfn|''The Sydney Morning Herald''|2003}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Aboriginal deaths in custody]]\n* [[Aboriginal sites of New South Wales]]\n* [[Australian Aboriginal sacred sites]]\n* [[Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet]]\n* [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]]\n* [[Australian outback literature of the 20th century]]\n* [[Australo-Melanesian]]\n* [[Customary law in Australia]]\n* [[Indigenous Protected Area]]\n* [[IndigenousX]], media platform for Indigenous Australians \n* [[List of Indigenous Australian firsts]]\n* [[List of laws concerning Indigenous Australians]]\n* [[NAIDOC Week]]\n* [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]\n* [[Welcome to country]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=35em}}\n*{{Cite web| title = 1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia, 2002\n | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument\n | date = 25 January 2002\n | ref = {{harvid|ABoS|2002}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia, 2005\n | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/00000000000000000000000000000000/294322bc5648ead8ca256f7200833040!OpenDocument\n | date = 21 January 2005a\n | ref = {{harvid|ABoS|2005a}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 1370.0 \u2013 Measures of Australia's Progress, 2004\n | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/A03CAD8F1C3F813BCA256E7D00002641\n | date = 21 April 2004b | access-date = 12 October 2009\n | ref = {{harvid|ABoS|2004b}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 2020 Summiteer Dr Kelvin Kong \u2013 Life Matters\n | publisher = ABC | location = Australia\n | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lifematters/stories/2008/2176627.htm\n | date = 3 March 2008 | access-date = 27 June 2010\n | ref = {{harvid|ABC|2008}}\n}}\n*{{cite web| title = 2071.0 -

An [[air compressor]] is a specific type of gas compressor.\n\nCompressors are similar to [[pump]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.\n\nMany compressors can be staged, that is, the fluid is compressed several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, to accommodate the already compressed gas. Each stage further compresses the gas and increases pressure. Those that are powered by an electric motor can also be controlled using a [[Variable-frequency drive|VFD]] or [[power inverter]], however many (hermetic and semi-hermetic) compressors can only work at certain speeds, since they may include built-in oil pumps. The oil pumps are connected to the same shaft that drives the compressor and forces oil into the compressor and motor bearings. At low speeds, insufficient quantities or no oil is forced into the bearings, eventually leading to bearing failure, while at high speeds, excessive amounts of oil may be lost from the bearings and compressor and potentially into the discharge line due to splashing. Eventually the oil runs out and the bearings are left unlubricated, again leading to failure, and the oil may contaminate the refrigerant, air or other working gas. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/learn/history/ichigoki/1981aircon/index.htm|title=Toshiba Science Museum : World's First Residential Inverter Air Conditioner|website=toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp}}</ref>\n\n==Types of compressors==\nThe main and important types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:\n[[File:Gas-compressors-types-yed.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Positive displacement===\nA positive displacement compressor is the system which compresses the air by the displacement of a mechanical linkage reducing the volume (since the reduction in volume due to a piston in thermodynamics is considered as positive displacement of the piston).{{vague|date=May 2018}}\n\nPut another way, a positive displacement compressor is one which operates by drawing in a discrete volume of gas from its inlet then forcing that gas to exit via the compressor's outlet.  The increase in the pressure of the gas is due, at least in part, to the compressor pumping it at a mass flow rate which cannot pass through the outlet at the lower pressure and density of the inlet.\n\n====Reciprocating compressors====\n\n{{main article|Reciprocating compressor}}\n[[File:ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg|right|thumb|A motor-driven six-cylinder reciprocating compressor that can operate with two, four or six cylinders.]]\n'''Reciprocating compressors''' use [[piston]]s driven by a crankshaft.

[[discharge pressure|Discharge pressures]] can range from low pressure to very high pressure (>18000 psi or 180 MPa).

Because of this, it finds use in a wide range of applications in many different industries and can be designed to a wide range of capacities, by varying size, number of cylinders, and cylinder unloading. However, it suffers from higher losses due to clearance volumes, resistance due to discharge and suction valves, weighs more, is difficult to mantain due to having a large number of moving parts, and it has inherent vibration. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\">https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SPD_VAVR-AE7T7G_EN</ref>\n\n====Ionic liquid piston compressor====\n\n{{main article|Ionic liquid piston compressor}}\nAn [[ionic liquid piston compressor]], ''ionic compressor'' or ''ionic liquid piston pump'' is a [[hydrogen compressor]] based on an [[ionic liquid]] piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal [[diaphragm compressor]].<ref>[https://www.air-compressorsdirect.co.uk/]{{|date=November 2019 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Rotary screw compressors====\n\n[[File:RotaryScrewCompressor.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of a rotary screw compressor]]\n{{main article|Rotary screw compressor}}\n'''Rotary screw compressors''' use two meshed rotating positive-displacement [[Helix|helical screws]] to force the gas into a smaller space.<ref name=Perry/><ref>[http://www.blackmer.com/tech-screw.jsp Screw Compressor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110103341/http://www.blackmer.com/tech-screw.jsp |date=2008-01-10 }} Describes how screw compressors work and include photographs.</ref><ref>[http://www.domnickhunter.com/tech_Centre.asp?chapter=1&section=3_Screw-Compressors_2_3.htm&getIndex=false Technical Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213211548/http://www.domnickhunter.com/tech_Centre.asp?chapter=1&section=3_Screw-Compressors_2_3.htm&getIndex=false |date=2007-12-13 }} Discusses oil-flooded screw compressors including a complete system flow diagram</ref> These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable.

The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing.<ref name=Perry/> Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.\n\nWith suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., {{convert|2|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about {{convert|13|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on}} in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.\n\nRotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matteicomp.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509233715/http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063|url-status=dead|title=Rotary Vane Compressors and the Vane Compressor - Compressors for stationary industrial and OEM applications - Mattei|first=Mattei Compressors|last=Inc|archivedate=May 9, 2010|website=www.matteicomp.com}}</ref>\n\n====Rolling piston====\n\n[[File:Rollkolbenverdichter.png|thumb|Rolling piston compressor]]\nThe Rolling piston in a rolling piston style compressor plays the part of a partition between the vane and the rotor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|title=Motion of Rolling Piston in Rotary Compressor|website=Purdue University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816232859/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|archive-date=2017-08-16|url-status=live|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> Rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.\n\n2 of these compressors can be mounted on the same shaft to increase capacity and reduce vibration and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/what-the-new-samsung-mini-rotary-compressor-means|title=What the New Samsung Mini Rotary Compressor Means|website=news.samsung.com}}</ref> A design without a spring is known as a swing compressor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/products/ac/lineup/skyair/|title=High Efficiency Compressor to Achieve a High COP &#124; Air Conditioning and Refrigeration &#124; Daikin Global|website=www.daikin.com}}</ref>\n\nIn refrigeration and air conditioning, this type of compressor is also known as a rotary compressor, with rotary screw compressors being also known simply as screw compressors.\n\nIt offers higher efficiency than reciprocating compressors due to less losses from the clearance volume between the piston and the compressor casing, its 40% to 50% smaller and lighter for a given capacity (which can impact material and shipping costs when used in a product), causes less vibration, has fewer components and is more reliable than a reciprocating compressor. But its structure does not allow capacities beyond 5 refrigeration tons, is less reliable than other compressor types, and is less efficient than other compressor types due to losses from the clearance volume. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Scroll compressors====\n\n[[File:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|thumb|right|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]\n{{main article|Scroll compressor}}\nA '''scroll compressor''', also known as '''scroll pump''' and '''scroll vacuum pump''', uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to [[pump]] or compress [[fluid]]s such as [[liquids]] and [[gas]]es. The vane geometry may be [[involute]], [[archimedean spiral]], or hybrid curves.<ref>Tischer, J., Utter, R: \u201cScroll Machine Using Discharge Pressure For Axial Sealing,\u201d U.S. Patent 4522575, 1985.</ref><ref>Caillat, J., Weatherston, R., Bush, J: \u201cScroll-Type Machine With Axially Compliant Mounting,\u201d U.S. Patent 4767293, 1988.</ref><ref>Richardson, Jr., Hubert: \u201cScroll Compressor With Orbiting Scroll Member Biased By Oil Pressure,\u201d U.S. Patent 4875838, 1989.</ref> They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range.\n\nOften, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.\n\nDue to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors have a very high [[volumetric efficiency]].\n\nThese compressors are extensively used in air conditioning and refrigeration because they are lighter, smaller and have fewer moving parts than reciprocating compressors and they are also more reliable. They are more expensive though, so peltier coolers or rotary and reciprocating compressors may be used in applications where cost is the most important or one of the most important factors to consider when designing a refrigeration or air conditioining system.\n\nThis type of compressor was used as the [[G-Lader|supercharger]] on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.\n\nWhen compared with reciprocating and rolling piston compressors, scroll compressors are more reliable since they have fewer components and have a simpler structure, is more efficient since they have no clearance volume nor valves, has less surging and it doesn't vibrate as much. But, when compared with screw and centrifugal compressors, scroll compressors have lower efficiencies and smaller capacities. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diaphragm compressors====\n\n{{main article|Diaphragm compressor}}\nA '''diaphragm compressor''' (also known as a '''membrane compressor''') is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nThe degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.\n\nDiaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas ([[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) as well as in a number of other applications.\n\n[[File:DiaphragmCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A three-stage diaphragm compressor]]\nThe photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to {{convert|6000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} for use in a prototype [[compressed hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling station built in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by the [[Arizona Public Service]] company (an electric utilities company). [[Reciprocating compressor]]s were used to compress the [[natural gas]]. The reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by [[Sertco]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Eric Slack | title=Sertco | date=Winter 2016 | url=http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | publisher=Phoenix Media Corporation | work=Energy and Mining International | accessdate=February 27, 2016 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304170914/http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe prototype [[alternative fuel]]ing station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety, environmental and building codes in Phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas.\n\n===Dynamic===\nDynamic compressors depend upon the [[inertia]] and [[momentum]] of a fluid.\n\n====Air bubble compressor====\nAlso known as a [[trompe]]. A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=Page 633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326071901/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archivedate=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\n====Centrifugal compressors====\n[[File:CentrifugalCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor]]\n[[File:Fan, before 1945.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor, early 1900s, G.

With multiple staging, they can achieve high output pressures greater than {{convert|1000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}.\n\nThis type of compressor, along with screw compressors, are extensively used in large refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Magnetically levitated and air bearing centrifugal compressors exist.\n\nMany large [[snowmaking]] operations (like [[ski resorts]]) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as [[supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s. Centrifugal compressors are used in small [[gas turbine]] [[engine]]s or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.\n\nCentrifugal compressors are the largest available compressors, offer higher efficiencies under partial loads, may be oil-free when using air or magnetic bearings which increases the heat transfer coefficient in evaporators and condensers, weigh up to 90% less and occupy 50% less space than reciprocating compressors, are reliable and cost less to mantain since less components are exposed to wear, and only generate minimal vibration. But, their initial cost is higher, require highly precise [[CNC]] machining, the impeller needs to rotate at high speeds making small compressors impractical, and surging becomes more likely. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> Surging is gas flow reversal, meaning that the gas goes from the discharge to the suction side, which can cause serious damage, specially in the compressor bearings and its drive shaft. It is caused by a pressure on the discharge side that is higher than the output pressure of the compressor. This can cause gases to flow back and forth between the compressor and whatever is connected to its discharge line, causing oscillations. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====\n'''Diagonal''' or '''[[mixed-flow compressor]]s''' are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor.

They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.\n\nThe arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or ''rotors'', accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as ''stators'' or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage.<ref name=Perry /> Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial [[Mach number]]. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).\n\nAxial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% [[polytropic]] at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial compressors are used in medium to large [[gas turbine]] engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.\n\n==={{Anchor|Hermetically-sealed compressor}} Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===\n[[File:Ledni\u010dka Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, kompresor s odpa\u0159ovac\u00ed miskou (002).JPG|thumb|A small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]] typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut, which seals operating gases inside the system. There is no route for gases to leak, such as around motor shaft seals. On this model, the plastic top section is part of an [[auto-defrost]] system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water.]]\n\nCompressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and [[Electric motor|motor]] drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is '''hermetically sealed compressor''', while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a '''semi-hermetic compressor'''.\n\nIn hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.\n\nThe difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers with screws that can be opened to replace motor and compressor components.\n\nThe primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. Open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure, and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties.\n\nAn open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic or semi-hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.\n\nThe disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced (This can also happen in semi hermetic compressors where the motor operates in the refrigerant). Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair and labor is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device or compressor. Semi-hermetic compressors are used in mid-sized to large refrigeration and air conditioning systems, where it is cheaper to repair the compressor rather than buying and installing a new one. A hermetic compressor is simpler and cheaper to build than a semi-hermetic compressor.\n\nAn advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources, such as an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[turbine]]. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally ''maintenance-free'' throughout the life of the system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.\n\n==Thermodynamics of gas compression==\n\n===Isentropic compressor===\nA compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and [[adiabatic]], thus an [[isentropic]] steady state device, meaning the change in [[entropy]] is 0.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\">Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A.

Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes.\n\n==Temperature==\n{{main article|Gas laws}}\nCompression of a gas increases its [[temperature]].\n: <math>W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} p dV = p_1 V_1^n \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-n} dV</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\frac { p_2 }{ p_1 }\\ = \\left( \\frac{ V_1 } { V_2 }\\ \\right) ^ n</math>\nor\n: <math>p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n = p V^n</math>\nand\n: <math>p = \\frac {p_1 V_1^n}{V^n} </math>\n\nso\n: <math>W = \\frac {{p_1} {V_1^n}} {1-n}\\ ( {V_2^{1-n}} - {V_1^{1-n}} ) </math>\n\nin which ''p'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''n'' takes different values for different compression processes (see below), and 1 & 2 refer to initial and final states.\n\n{{anchor|Adiabatic}}\n* [[Adiabatic process|Adiabatic]] - This model assumes that no energy (heat) is transferred to or from the gas during the compression, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is:<ref>''Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook'' 8th edition\nPerry, Green, page 10-45 section 10-76</ref>\n: <math> T_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac {p_2}{p_1}\\right)^{(\\kappa-1)/\\kappa} </math>\nwith ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> in degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] or [[kelvin]]s, ''p''<sub>2</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub> being absolute pressures and <math>\\kappa = </math> [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]]s (approximately 1.4 for air).  The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.\nThe relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of <math>n</math> for an adiabatic process is <math>\\kappa</math> (the ratio of specific heats).\n\n{{anchor|Isothermal}}\n* [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] - This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.\n\nFor an isothermal process, <math>n</math> is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:\n: <math>W = - {p_1} {V_1} \\ln \\left( \\frac {p_2} {p_1} \\right)</math>\n\nWhen evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.\n\n{{anchor|Polytropic}}\n* [[Polytropic process|Polytropic]] - This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of <math>n</math> between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of <math>n</math> will be between 1 and <math>\\kappa</math>.\n\n==Staged compression==\nIn the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in [[vapor-liquid separator]]s.\n\nIn the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the [[intercooler]] of a two or more stage compressor.\n\nBecause rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 343 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s). ({{convert|343|atm|MPa ksi|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out|disp=or}})\n\n==Drive motors==\nThere are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:\n* Gas [[turbine]]s power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of [[jet engine]]s.\n* [[Steam turbine]]s or [[water turbine]]s are possible for large compressors.\n* [[Electric motor]]s are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[alternating current]]. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] alternating current supply is available.\n* [[Diesel engine]]s or [[petrol engine]]s are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. \n* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a [[supercharger]]), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a [[turbocharger]]).\n\n==Applications==\nGas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:\n* In [[pipeline transport]] of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.\n* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.\n* [[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioner]] equipment use compressors to move [[heat]] in [[refrigerant]] cycles (see ''[[vapor-compression refrigeration]]'').\n* Gas turbine systems compress the intake [[combustion]] air.\n* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for [[medical]], [[welding]], and other uses.\n* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require [[compressed air]] to power [[pneumatic tools]].\n* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.\n* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain [[cabin pressurization]] at altitude.\n* Some types of [[jet engine]]s\u2014such as [[turbojet]]s and [[turbofan]]s\u2014compress the air required for fuel combustion. The jet engine's [[turbine]]s power the combustion air compressor.\n* In [[SCUBA diving]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], and other life support devices, compressors put [[breathing gas]] into small volume containers, such as [[diving cylinder]]s.<ref name=evil>{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air \u2013 the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201351 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |pmid=22692708 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 }}</ref><ref name=oxyhackers >{{cite book |author=Harlow, V |title=Oxygen Hacker's Companion |publisher=Airspeed Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-9678873-2-1}}</ref>\n* In [[surface supplied diving]], an air compressor frequently supplies low pressure air (10 to 20 bar) for breathing.\n* [[Submarine]]s use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust depth.\n* [[Turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s are compressors that increase [[internal combustion engine]] performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder, so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power.\n* [[Rail transport|Rail]] and heavy [[road transport]] vehicles use [[compressed air]] to operate [[Air brake (rail)|rail vehicle]] or [[Air brake (road vehicle)|road vehicle]] brakes\u2014and various other systems ([[door]]s, [[windscreen wiper]]s, [[engine]], [[gearbox]] control, etc.).\n* Service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic [[tire]]s and power pneumatic tools.\n* [[Fire piston]]s and [[heat pump]]s exist to heat air or other gasses, and compressing the gas is only a means to that end.\n* Rotary lobe compressors are often used to provide air in pneumatic conveying lines for powder or solids.

An [[air compressor]] is a specific type of gas compressor.\n\nCompressors are similar to [[pump]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.\n\nMany compressors can be staged, that is, the fluid is compressed several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, to accommodate the already compressed gas. Each stage further compresses the gas and increases pressure. Those that are powered by an electric motor can also be controlled using a [[Variable-frequency drive|VFD]] or [[power inverter]], however many (hermetic and semi-hermetic) compressors can only work at certain speeds, since they may include built-in oil pumps. The oil pumps are connected to the same shaft that drives the compressor and forces oil into the compressor and motor bearings. At low speeds, insufficient quantities or no oil is forced into the bearings, eventually leading to bearing failure, while at high speeds, excessive amounts of oil may be lost from the bearings and compressor and potentially into the discharge line due to splashing. Eventually the oil runs out and the bearings are left unlubricated, again leading to failure, and the oil may contaminate the refrigerant, air or other working gas. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/learn/history/ichigoki/1981aircon/index.htm|title=Toshiba Science Museum : World's First Residential Inverter Air Conditioner|website=toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp}}</ref>\n\n==Types of compressors==\nThe main and important types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:\n[[File:Gas-compressors-types-yed.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Positive displacement===\nA positive displacement compressor is the system which compresses the air by the displacement of a mechanical linkage reducing the volume (since the reduction in volume due to a piston in thermodynamics is considered as positive displacement of the piston).{{vague|date=May 2018}}\n\nPut another way, a positive displacement compressor is one which operates by drawing in a discrete volume of gas from its inlet then forcing that gas to exit via the compressor's outlet.

The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing.<ref name=Perry/> Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.\n\nWith suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., {{convert|2|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about {{convert|13|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on}} in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.\n\nRotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matteicomp.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509233715/http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063|url-status=dead|title=Rotary Vane Compressors and the Vane Compressor - Compressors for stationary industrial and OEM applications - Mattei|first=Mattei Compressors|last=Inc|archivedate=May 9, 2010|website=www.matteicomp.com}}</ref>\n\n====Rolling piston====\n\n[[File:Rollkolbenverdichter.png|thumb|Rolling piston compressor]]\nThe Rolling piston in a rolling piston style compressor plays the part of a partition between the vane and the rotor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|title=Motion of Rolling Piston in Rotary Compressor|website=Purdue University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816232859/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=icec|archive-date=2017-08-16|url-status=live|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> Rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.\n\n2 of these compressors can be mounted on the same shaft to increase capacity and reduce vibration and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/what-the-new-samsung-mini-rotary-compressor-means|title=What the New Samsung Mini Rotary Compressor Means|website=news.samsung.com}}</ref> A design without a spring is known as a swing compressor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/products/ac/lineup/skyair/|title=High Efficiency Compressor to Achieve a High COP &#124; Air Conditioning and Refrigeration &#124; Daikin Global|website=www.daikin.com}}</ref>\n\nIn refrigeration and air conditioning, this type of compressor is also known as a rotary compressor, with rotary screw compressors being also known simply as screw compressors.\n\nIt offers higher efficiency than reciprocating compressors due to less losses from the clearance volume between the piston and the compressor casing, its 40% to 50% smaller and lighter for a given capacity (which can impact material and shipping costs when used in a product), causes less vibration, has fewer components and is more reliable than a reciprocating compressor. But its structure does not allow capacities beyond 5 refrigeration tons, is less reliable than other compressor types, and is less efficient than other compressor types due to losses from the clearance volume. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Scroll compressors====\n\n[[File:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|thumb|right|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]\n{{main article|Scroll compressor}}\nA '''scroll compressor''', also known as '''scroll pump''' and '''scroll vacuum pump''', uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to [[pump]] or compress [[fluid]]s such as [[liquids]] and [[gas]]es. The vane geometry may be [[involute]], [[archimedean spiral]], or hybrid curves.<ref>Tischer, J., Utter, R: \u201cScroll Machine Using Discharge Pressure For Axial Sealing,\u201d U.S. Patent 4522575, 1985.</ref><ref>Caillat, J., Weatherston, R., Bush, J: \u201cScroll-Type Machine With Axially Compliant Mounting,\u201d U.S. Patent 4767293, 1988.</ref><ref>Richardson, Jr., Hubert: \u201cScroll Compressor With Orbiting Scroll Member Biased By Oil Pressure,\u201d U.S. Patent 4875838, 1989.</ref> They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range.\n\nOften, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.\n\nDue to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors have a very high [[volumetric efficiency]].\n\nThese compressors are extensively used in air conditioning and refrigeration because they are lighter, smaller and have fewer moving parts than reciprocating compressors and they are also more reliable. They are more expensive though, so peltier coolers or rotary and reciprocating compressors may be used in applications where cost is the most important or one of the most important factors to consider when designing a refrigeration or air conditioining system.\n\nThis type of compressor was used as the [[G-Lader|supercharger]] on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.\n\nWhen compared with reciprocating and rolling piston compressors, scroll compressors are more reliable since they have fewer components and have a simpler structure, is more efficient since they have no clearance volume nor valves, has less surging and it doesn't vibrate as much. But, when compared with screw and centrifugal compressors, scroll compressors have lower efficiencies and smaller capacities. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diaphragm compressors====\n\n{{main article|Diaphragm compressor}}\nA '''diaphragm compressor''' (also known as a '''membrane compressor''') is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nThe degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.\n\nDiaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas ([[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) as well as in a number of other applications.\n\n[[File:DiaphragmCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A three-stage diaphragm compressor]]\nThe photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to {{convert|6000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} for use in a prototype [[compressed hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling station built in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by the [[Arizona Public Service]] company (an electric utilities company).

A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=Page 633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326071901/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archivedate=2017-03-26}}</ref>\n\n====Centrifugal compressors====\n[[File:CentrifugalCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor]]\n[[File:Fan, before 1945.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor, early 1900s, G.

Magnetically levitated and air bearing centrifugal compressors exist.\n\nMany large [[snowmaking]] operations (like [[ski resorts]]) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as [[supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s. Centrifugal compressors are used in small [[gas turbine]] [[engine]]s or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.\n\nCentrifugal compressors are the largest available compressors, offer higher efficiencies under partial loads, may be oil-free when using air or magnetic bearings which increases the heat transfer coefficient in evaporators and condensers, weigh up to 90% less and occupy 50% less space than reciprocating compressors, are reliable and cost less to mantain since less components are exposed to wear, and only generate minimal vibration. But, their initial cost is higher, require highly precise [[CNC]] machining, the impeller needs to rotate at high speeds making small compressors impractical, and surging becomes more likely. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> Surging is gas flow reversal, meaning that the gas goes from the discharge to the suction side, which can cause serious damage, specially in the compressor bearings and its drive shaft. It is caused by a pressure on the discharge side that is higher than the output pressure of the compressor. This can cause gases to flow back and forth between the compressor and whatever is connected to its discharge line, causing oscillations. <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====\n'''Diagonal''' or '''[[mixed-flow compressor]]s''' are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor.

They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.\n\nThe arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or ''rotors'', accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as ''stators'' or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage.<ref name=Perry /> Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial [[Mach number]]. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).\n\nAxial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% [[polytropic]] at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial compressors are used in medium to large [[gas turbine]] engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.\n\n==={{Anchor|Hermetically-sealed compressor}} Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===\n[[File:Ledni\u010dka Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, kompresor s odpa\u0159ovac\u00ed miskou (002).JPG|thumb|A small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]] typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut, which seals operating gases inside the system. There is no route for gases to leak, such as around motor shaft seals. On this model, the plastic top section is part of an [[auto-defrost]] system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water.]]\n\nCompressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and [[Electric motor|motor]] drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is '''hermetically sealed compressor''', while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a '''semi-hermetic compressor'''.\n\nIn hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.\n\nThe difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers with screws that can be opened to replace motor and compressor components.\n\nThe primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. Open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure, and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties.\n\nAn open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic or semi-hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.\n\nThe disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced (This can also happen in semi hermetic compressors where the motor operates in the refrigerant). Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair and labor is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device or compressor. Semi-hermetic compressors are used in mid-sized to large refrigeration and air conditioning systems, where it is cheaper to repair the compressor rather than buying and installing a new one. A hermetic compressor is simpler and cheaper to build than a semi-hermetic compressor.\n\nAn advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources, such as an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[turbine]]. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally ''maintenance-free'' throughout the life of the system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.\n\n==Thermodynamics of gas compression==\n\n===Isentropic compressor===\nA compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and [[adiabatic]], thus an [[isentropic]] steady state device, meaning the change in [[entropy]] is 0.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\">Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A.

One common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\"/>\n\n===Compressors in ideal thermodynamic cycles===\nIdeal [[Rankine Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a [[pump]]\n<br />\nIdeal [[Carnot Cycle]] 4->1 [[Isentropic]] compression\n<br />\nIdeal [[Otto Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression\n<br />\nIdeal [[Diesel Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression\n<br />\nIdeal [[Brayton Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a compressor\n<br />\nIdeal [[Vapor-compression refrigeration | Vapor-compression refrigeration Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a compressor\n<br />\nNOTE: The isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes.\n\n==Temperature==\n{{main article|Gas laws}}\nCompression of a gas increases its [[temperature]].\n: <math>W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} p dV = p_1 V_1^n \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-n} dV</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\frac { p_2 }{ p_1 }\\ = \\left( \\frac{ V_1 } { V_2 }\\ \\right) ^ n</math>\nor\n: <math>p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n = p V^n</math>\nand\n: <math>p = \\frac {p_1 V_1^n}{V^n} </math>\n\nso\n: <math>W = \\frac {{p_1} {V_1^n}} {1-n}\\ ( {V_2^{1-n}} - {V_1^{1-n}} ) </math>\n\nin which ''p'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''n'' takes different values for different compression processes (see below), and 1 & 2 refer to initial and final states.\n\n{{anchor|Adiabatic}}\n* [[Adiabatic process|Adiabatic]] - This model assumes that no energy (heat) is transferred to or from the gas during the compression, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is:<ref>''Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook'' 8th edition\nPerry, Green, page 10-45 section 10-76</ref>\n: <math> T_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac {p_2}{p_1}\\right)^{(\\kappa-1)/\\kappa} </math>\nwith ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> in degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] or [[kelvin]]s, ''p''<sub>2</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub> being absolute pressures and <math>\\kappa = </math> [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]]s (approximately 1.4 for air).  The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.\nThe relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of <math>n</math> for an adiabatic process is <math>\\kappa</math> (the ratio of specific heats).\n\n{{anchor|Isothermal}}\n* [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] - This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.\n\nFor an isothermal process, <math>n</math> is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:\n: <math>W = - {p_1} {V_1} \\ln \\left( \\frac {p_2} {p_1} \\right)</math>\n\nWhen evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.\n\n{{anchor|Polytropic}}\n* [[Polytropic process|Polytropic]] - This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of <math>n</math> between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of <math>n</math> will be between 1 and <math>\\kappa</math>.\n\n==Staged compression==\nIn the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in [[vapor-liquid separator]]s.\n\nIn the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the [[intercooler]] of a two or more stage compressor.\n\nBecause rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 343 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s). ({{convert|343|atm|MPa ksi|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out|disp=or}})\n\n==Drive motors==\nThere are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:\n* Gas [[turbine]]s power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of [[jet engine]]s.\n* [[Steam turbine]]s or [[water turbine]]s are possible for large compressors.\n* [[Electric motor]]s are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[alternating current]]. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] alternating current supply is available.\n* [[Diesel engine]]s or [[petrol engine]]s are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. \n* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a [[supercharger]]), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a [[turbocharger]]).\n\n==Applications==\nGas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:\n* In [[pipeline transport]] of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.\n* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.\n* [[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioner]] equipment use compressors to move [[heat]] in [[refrigerant]] cycles (see ''[[vapor-compression refrigeration]]'').\n* Gas turbine systems compress the intake [[combustion]] air.\n* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for [[medical]], [[welding]], and other uses.\n* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require [[compressed air]] to power [[pneumatic tools]].\n* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.\n* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain [[cabin pressurization]] at altitude.\n* Some types of [[jet engine]]s\u2014such as [[turbojet]]s and [[turbofan]]s\u2014compress the air required for fuel combustion. The jet engine's [[turbine]]s power the combustion air compressor.\n* In [[SCUBA diving]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], and other life support devices, compressors put [[breathing gas]] into small volume containers, such as [[diving cylinder]]s.<ref name=evil>{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air \u2013 the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201351 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |pmid=22692708 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 }}</ref><ref name=oxyhackers >{{cite book |author=Harlow, V |title=Oxygen Hacker's Companion |publisher=Airspeed Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-9678873-2-1}}</ref>\n* In [[surface supplied diving]], an air compressor frequently supplies low pressure air (10 to 20 bar) for breathing.\n* [[Submarine]]s use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust depth.\n* [[Turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s are compressors that increase [[internal combustion engine]] performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder, so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power.\n* [[Rail transport|Rail]] and heavy [[road transport]] vehicles use [[compressed air]] to operate [[Air brake (rail)|rail vehicle]] or [[Air brake (road vehicle)|road vehicle]] brakes\u2014and various other systems ([[door]]s, [[windscreen wiper]]s, [[engine]], [[gearbox]] control, etc.).\n* Service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic [[tire]]s and power pneumatic tools.\n* [[Fire piston]]s and [[heat pump]]s exist to heat air or other gasses, and compressing the gas is only a means to that end.\n* Rotary lobe compressors are often used to provide air in pneumatic conveying lines for powder or solids.
