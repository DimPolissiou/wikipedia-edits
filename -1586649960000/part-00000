This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one who first recorded the teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.\n\nIn classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who were notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.\n\nSeparately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]  developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.\n\n===Rome===\n\nIn the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.\n\nThe Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome\u2014very wealthy and prominent members of society.\n\nThe Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking was seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a \"plain\" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.\n\n==Historical speeches==\n{{seealso|List of speeches}}\n\nDespite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied years after their delivery. Among these examples are:\n*[[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BC addressing those who died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]\n*Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863\n*Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in \"[[Ain't I a Woman?]] \n*Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.<ref>German, Kathleen M.

Members learn by observation and practice, and hone their skills by listening to constructive suggestions followed by new public speaking exercises. These include:\n* Oratory\n* The use of [[Body language|gestures]]\n* Control of the [[voice]] ([[inflection]])\n* [[Vocabulary]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], word choice\n* Speaking notes, pitches\n* Using [[humor]]\n* Developing a relationship with the audience\n* \"Show of Hands Method\" (used primarily for [[Billboard]] presentations)\n* Extemporaneous and Enthusiastic Delivery\n* Effective Introduction\n*Efforts to Reach Hearts\n*Effective use of questions\nThe new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide actual examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to effectively use humour as a communication tool, and continuously researching in their topic area of focus.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Glossophobia==\n{{seealso|Glossophobia}}\nA common fear of public speaking is called [[glossophobia]] (or, informally, \"stage fright\"), this state of response by many beginners confuse with normal nerves and anxiety with a genuine phobia.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason= Ungrammatical sentence}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.psycom.net/glossophobia-fear-of-public-speaking |title=Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking): Are You Glossophobic? |last=Black |first=Rosemary |date=2018-06-04 |website=psycom.net |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Modern==\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Ettus Ted Talk 1.png|thumb|200px|Ettus Ted Talk]]\nNew technology has also opened different forms of public speaking that are nontraditional such as TED Talks,<ref>[[TED (conference)]]</ref> which are conferences that are broadcast globally.

For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a [[public address system]] or [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]].\n\nThese new forms of public speaking, which can be considered nontraditional, have opened up debates about whether or not these forms of public speaking are actually public speaking. Many people consider TED Talks and YouTube broadcasting to not be true forms of public speaking because there is not a  real, physical audience. Others argue that public speaking is about getting a group of people together in order to educate them further regardless of how or where the audience is located {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Telecommunication===\n[[Telecommunication]] and [[videoconferencing]] are also forms of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': \"Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems.\" This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.\n\n===Notable modern theorists===\n*[[Harold Lasswell]] developed [[Lasswell's model of communication]]. There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in this theory: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question \"''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?\"\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Audience response]]\n* [[Crowd manipulation]]\n* [[Debate]]\n* [[Eloquence]]\n* [[Glossophobia]]\n* [[List of speeches]]\n* [[Public orator]]\n*[[Persuasion]] \n* [[Rhetoric]]\n* [[Speechwriter]]\n* [[Speakers' bureau]]\n* [[Thematic interpretation]]\n* [[Toastmasters International]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Public speaking}}\n* {{dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Communication/Public_Speaking}}\n* [https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen How to speak so that people want to listen]\n[[Category:Public speaking| ]]\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Political science]]\n[[Category:Performing arts]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Process and act of speaking or giving a lecture to a group of people in a structured, deliberate manner intended to inform, influence, or entertain a listening audience}}\n{{For|the 2010 HBO documentary|Public Speaking (film)}}\n{{Redirect|Public speaker|a person who delivers an oration|Orator}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|300px|The Roman orator [[Cicero]] speaks to the Roman Senate.<br />''Cicero Denounces Catiline'' (1889), fresco by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]\n{{Communication}}\n{{Performing arts}}\n'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]].

These include:\n* Oratory\n* The use of [[Body language|gestures]]\n* Control of the [[voice]] ([[inflection]])\n* [[Vocabulary]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], word choice\n* Speaking notes, pitches\n* Using [[humor]]\n* Developing a relationship with the audience\n* \"Show of Hands Method\" (used primarily for [[Billboard]] presentations)\n* Extemporaneous and Enthusiastic Delivery\n* Effective Introduction\n*Efforts to Reach Hearts\n*Effective use of questions\nThe new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide actual examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to effectively use humour as a communication tool, and continuously researching in their topic area of focus.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Glossophobia==\n{{seealso|Glossophobia}}\nA common fear of public speaking is called [[glossophobia]] (or, informally, \"stage fright\"), this state of response by many beginners confuse with normal nerves and anxiety with a genuine phobia.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason= ungrammatical sentence}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.psycom.net/glossophobia-fear-of-public-speaking |title=Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking): Are You Glossophobic? |last=Black |first=Rosemary |date=2018-06-04 |website=psycom.net |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Modern==\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Ettus Ted Talk 1.png|thumb|200px|Ettus Ted Talk]]\nNew technology has also opened different forms of public speaking that are nontraditional such as TED Talks,<ref>[[TED (conference)]]</ref> which are conferences that are broadcast globally. This form of public speaking has created a wider audience base because public speaking can now reach both physical and virtual audiences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gallo |first=Carmine |title=Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1466837270}}</ref> These audiences can be watching from all around the world. [[YouTube]] is another platform that allows public speaking to reach a larger audience. On YouTube, people can post videos of themselves.

For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a [[public address system]] or [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]].\n\nThese new forms of public speaking, which can be considered nontraditional, have opened up debates about whether or not these forms of public speaking are actually public speaking. Many people consider TED Talks and YouTube broadcasting to not be true forms of public speaking because there is not a  real, physical audience. Others argue that public speaking is about getting a group of people together in order to educate them further regardless of how or where the audience is located {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Telecommunication===\n[[Telecommunication]] and [[videoconferencing]] are also forms of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': \"Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems.\" This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.\n\n===Notable modern theorists===\n*[[Harold Lasswell]] developed [[Lasswell's model of communication]]. There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in this theory: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question \"''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?\"\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Audience response]]\n* [[Crowd manipulation]]\n* [[Debate]]\n* [[Eloquence]]\n* [[Glossophobia]]\n* [[List of speeches]]\n* [[Public orator]]\n*[[Persuasion]] \n* [[Rhetoric]]\n* [[Speechwriter]]\n* [[Speakers' bureau]]\n* [[Thematic interpretation]]\n* [[Toastmasters International]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Public speaking}}\n* {{dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Communication/Public_Speaking}}\n* [https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen How to speak so that people want to listen]\n[[Category:Public speaking| ]]\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Political science]]\n[[Category:Performing arts]]\n", "name_user": "HalMartin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGlossophobia:capitalize \"ungrammatical\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking"}

In [[South America]] in particular, the legal purchase age is 18 years, with two exceptions:\n* In [[Paraguay]], the legal drinking age and purchase age is 20 years.\n* In [[Guyana]], minors aged 16 or 17 may consume a glass of beer, wine or cider in a restaurant provided they buy a meal.\n\nIn [[North America]] the legal drinking age and legal purchase age varies from 18 to 21 years:\n* In [[Mexico]], it is 18 for each.\n* In the [[United States]], the minimum legal age to purchase any alcohol beverage from a shop, supermarket, liquor store, bar, club or any other licensed premises is 21 years of age; the two exceptions are [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] where the age is 18. The legal drinking age varies by state.\n* In [[Canada]], most provinces have a minimum age of 19 years to buy or consume alcohol, while [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Quebec]] set it at 18 years.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, much of North America changed its minimum legal drinking ages (MLDAs) as follows: {{Quote|text=In the 1970s, provincial and state policy makers in Canada and the United States moved to lower MLDAs (which were set at 21 years in most provinces/territories and states) to coincide with the jurisdictional [[age of majority]] \u2014 typically 18 years of age.... As a result, MLDAs were reduced in all Canadian provinces [and] in [[U.S. history of alcohol minimum purchase age by state|more than half of US states]]. In Canada, however, two provinces, Ontario [in 1979] and Saskatchewan [in 1976], quickly raised their subsequent MLDAs from 18 to 19 years in response to a few studies demonstrating an association between the lowered drinking age and increases in alcohol-related harms to youth and young adults, including increases in [[motor vehicle accidents]] (MVAs) and [[alcohol intoxication]] among high school students. Following MLDA reductions in the US, research in several states provided persuasive evidence of sharp increases in rates of fatal and nonfatal MVAs appearing immediately after the implementation of lower drinking ages. These scientific findings galvanized public pressure on lawmakers to raise MLDAs and, in response, the federal government introduced the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]] of 1984, which imposed a reduction of highway funds for states if they did not increase their MLDA to 21 years. All states complied and implemented an MLDA of 21 years by 1988.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Impacts of drinking-age laws on mortality in Canada, 1980\u20132009|last1=Callaghan|first1=Russell |last2=Sanches|last3=Gatley|last4=Stockwell|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|year=2014|volume=138|pages=137\u201345|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.02.019|pmid=24631002|display-authors=1}}</ref>}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:75%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:15%;\"| State/region/province\n! colspan=2 style=\"width:30%;\"| [[De jure]]\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:40%;\"| Notes\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Drinking age\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Purchase age\n|-\n| colspan=2|''{{flag|Anguilla}}''\n| align=\"center\" |None<ref name=\"L075-00-Liquor Licences Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ai/laws/L075-00-Liquor%20Licences%20Act/|title=L075-00-Liquor Licences Act - 27. |publisher=Government of Anguilla|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\" |18<ref name=\"L075-00-Liquor Licences Act\"/>\n| It is prohibited to sell or serve alcohol drinks to anyone under the age of 18 years.

In [[South America]] in particular, the legal purchase age is 18 years, with two exceptions:\n* In [[Paraguay]], the legal drinking age and purchase age is 20 years.\n* In [[Guyana]], minors aged 16 or 17 may consume a glass of beer, wine or cider in a restaurant provided they buy a meal.\n\nIn [[North America]] the legal drinking age and legal purchase age varies from 18 to 21 years:\n* In [[Mexico]], it is 18 for each.\n* In the [[United States]], the minimum legal age to purchase any alcohol beverage from a shop, supermarket, liquor store, bar, club or any other licensed premises is 21 years of age; the two exceptions are [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] where the age is 18. The legal drinking age varies by state.\n* In [[Canada]], most provinces have a minimum age of 19 years to buy or consume alcohol, while [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Quebec]] set it at 18 years.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, much of North America changed its minimum legal drinking ages (MLDAs) as follows: {{Quote|text=In the 1970s, provincial and state policy makers in Canada and the United States moved to lower MLDAs (which were set at 21 years in most provinces/territories and states) to coincide with the jurisdictional [[age of majority]] \u2014 typically 18 years of age.... As a result, MLDAs were reduced in all Canadian provinces [and] in [[U.S. history of alcohol minimum purchase age by state|more than half of US states]]. In Canada, however, two provinces, Ontario [in 1979] and Saskatchewan [in 1976], quickly raised their subsequent MLDAs from 18 to 19 years in response to a few studies demonstrating an association between the lowered drinking age and increases in alcohol-related harms to youth and young adults, including increases in [[motor vehicle accidents]] (MVAs) and [[alcohol intoxication]] among high school students. Following MLDA reductions in the US, research in several states provided persuasive evidence of sharp increases in rates of fatal and nonfatal MVAs appearing immediately after the implementation of lower drinking ages. These scientific findings galvanized public pressure on lawmakers to raise MLDAs and, in response, the federal government introduced the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]] of 1984, which imposed a reduction of highway funds for states if they did not increase their MLDA to 21 years. All states complied and implemented an MLDA of 21 years by 1988.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Impacts of drinking-age laws on mortality in Canada, 1980\u20132009|last1=Callaghan|first1=Russell |last2=Sanches|last3=Gatley|last4=Stockwell|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|year=2014|volume=138|pages=137\u201345|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.02.019|pmid=24631002|display-authors=1}}</ref>}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:75%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:15%;\"| State/region/province\n! colspan=2 style=\"width:30%;\"| [[De jure]]\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:40%;\"| Notes\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Drinking age\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Purchase age\n|-\n| colspan=2|''{{flag|Anguilla}}''\n| align=\"center\" |None<ref name=\"L075-00-Liquor Licences Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ai/laws/L075-00-Liquor%20Licences%20Act/|title=L075-00-Liquor Licences Act - 27. |publisher=Government of Anguilla|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\" |18<ref name=\"L075-00-Liquor Licences Act\"/>\n| It is prohibited to sell or serve alcohol drinks to anyone under the age of 18 years.

{"title_page": "Sport Select", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n'''Sport Select''' is a group of [[sport]]s [[betting]] games offered by [[Canada]]'s [[province|provincial]] [[government]]s.  In [[Quebec]], the program is known as '''Pari sportif'''; in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, it is known as '''Pro-Line''' while in [[British Columbia]], it is known as '''Sports Action'''.  However, the rules for the games are similar in all [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]].  Initially created to offer betting primarily on the [[North America]]n [[major professional sports league]]s, Sport Select has expanded to offer betting on competitions such as the English [[Premier League]] and [[college sports]].\n\nSport Select (or equivalent) tickets can be purchased at all lottery centres across Canada, thus creating one of the most dense sports betting networks in the world.  In addition, some provinces are now accepting wagers over the [[Internet]].\n\n==Sport Select games==\nEach province offers versions of these three games under rules similar to those described below:\n\n===Pro-Line===\nKnown as '''Oddset''' in British Columbia and '''Mise-O-Jeu''' in Quebec, '''Pro-Line''' offers [[Fixed-odds gambling|fixed-odds]] sports betting, and is the most popular Sport Select game.  It does not offer betting on individual matches, partly because betting on a single sporting event is illegal under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  Therefore, Pro-Line is a parlay game where bettors wager on the outcome of anywhere from two to six (BC and Atlantic) and three to six (Quebec, Ontario and Western Canada) of the matches offered by the lottery corporation.  [[Fixed-odds gambling|Decimal odds]] are quoted for individual matches, the odds for each selection being multiplied to calculate the potential payout of the ticket.  For the ticket to pay out, all selections must be correct.  Some provinces offer ''Combo Play'' which does not require all selections to be correct for a payout, but a Combo Play ticket is effectively nothing more than a number of similar, individual Pro-Line tickets rolled into one.  [[Overtime (sport)|Overtime]] is considered when determining results, but overtime in [[soccer]] is not.\n\n===Point spread===\n''Point Spread'' is similar to those games offered by other [[bookmaker]]s where bettors are wagering against a quoted [[point spread]].  Bettors can make predictions on the outcomes of two to twelve games, depending on the province.  The payouts offered vary by province.\n\n===Over/Under===\nAlso known as ''Total'' in Quebec, ''Over/Under'' is similar to those games offered by other [[bookmaker]]s where bettors are wagering that the number of points scored in each match are over or under the quoted total.  Bettors can make predictions on the outcomes of two to twelve games, depending on the province.  The payouts offered vary by province.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://sieukeo.com/ |title= Sieukeo.com }} Saturday, April 11, 2020 </ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n{{refimprove|date=November 2016}}\n{{npov|date=November 2016}}\n===Odds===\n\nIn recent years, Sport Select has come under increasingly heavy criticism from Canadian gamblers due to the poor odds it offers (from the gambler's perspective).  A private bookmaker licensed in the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Nevada]] generally maintains an [[overround]] (or \"vig\") of about 110%, meaning the bookmaker can expect to pay out $100 for every $110 that is wagered.  In Canada, however, the overround for an individual match in Sport Select odds often exceeds 130%.  To make matters worse for the bettor, the parlay requirement compounds the overround - the actual vigorish is a minimum of 160% but can climb to well over ''300%'' (if six selections are made).  In jurisdictions such as the [[United Kingdom]] where genuine competition is allowed, bookies often pay bonuses for winning parlay bets to help offset the compounded vig.  Sport Select does not.\n\nAnother controversial frustration for Pro-Line players in Atlantic Canada is the occurrence of Atlantic Lottery (ALC) 'capping' wagering on combinations and, on rare occasion, individual selections.  This occurs when a significant amount of wagering is placed within a short span of time, typically on a specific combination of outcomes. The reasoning behind having such caps is to dissuade professional, or 'block', bettors from attempting to take advantage of potential flaws in the posted odds, and thus limits the liability for the corporation on a given combination of outcomes.  Typical block betting behaviour involves placing large sums (often thousands of $) on a very small amount of combinations, trying to focus on perceived flaws as much as possible.  Ultimately the Pro-Line game is meant to be recreational and not for professionals.  Unlike online-only betting operations where all transactions must be submitted by identity verified accounts, Atlantic Lottery operates across a network of retailers where wagers are accepted anonymously, thus making it more susceptible to such 'block' bettors.  The capping of combinations serves to limit pro-betting while keeping all outcomes open for betting, in any other combination.  If a combination of outcomes is capped, any subsequent transaction submitted to the system attempting to wager on this particular combination is rejected.  This can be an annoyance to non-professional (casual) bettors legitimately trying to wager on a capped combination, but experienced bettors have come to understand the reasoning and adjust their wagers accordingly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atlantic Lottery}}</ref>\n\nThough most experts agree that the odds offered on Sport Select are such that even the sharpest punter would have no hope of making a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] in the long term, some have. See, for instance, the 2007 Tax Court of Canada case R. v. Leblanc, in which two brothers netted $5.5 million on $50 million in bets over five years. The Tax Court ruled the profit was not taxable.\n\n===Ties===\nWhile ties are a common in [[soccer]] and used to be common in [[ice hockey]] as well, unlike what would be the case with most bookmakers the rules of Sport Select provide for betting on \"ties\" in nearly every sport including [[gridiron football|football]], [[basketball]] and in some provinces [[baseball]], even though ties are never allowed in basketball or baseball and are rare in football.  Consequently, Sport Select mandates that any game decided by five points or less in basketball, three points or less in football or one run in baseball (where applicable) is declared a \"tie\".  Furthermore, when the NHL introduced [[shoot out|shootouts]] in for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]] the lottery corporations (in contrast to most bookmakers) quickly ruled that shootout results would ''not'' count, specifically so they could keep offering \"ties\" in hockey. In Ontario, a hockey game that goes to a shootout counts as both a Tie and a Visitor or Home win, depending on the outcome.  The rule is loathed by most Canadian gamblers because the size of the winning margin often means little to the teams on the field/court.  Many bettors believe the rule's true purpose is to confuse gamblers and allow for larger vigs.\n\n===NBA===\nWagering on [[NBA]] games was an issue when [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] were being considered for NBA expansion franchises, due to strict league rules at the time which prohibited gambling.  The [[Toronto Raptors]] and [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] began play in the league in 1995 only after the provincial lottery corporations agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games.  As part of the agreement, the Raptors paid $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate the Ontario provincial lottery corporation for its loss of revenue.\n\nWhen the [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|Grizzlies relocated to Memphis]] in 2001, British Columbia resumed allowing wagering on NBA games.  In 2010, it was revealed that the Ontario Lottery Gaming Corporation and the Raptors were in negotiations to return wagering on NBA games to the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/basketball/2010/01/26/12623001.html|title=OLG 'hopeful' of adding NBA to Pro-Line|first=Mike|last=Ganter|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=2010-01-27|accessdate=2015-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/proline-raptors-wagering/|title=Pro-Line brings back wagering on all NBA games|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2015-06-16|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2010/01/27/negotiations_to_add_nba_to_proline_tickets_in_ontario.html|title=Negotiations to add NBA to Pro-Line tickets in Ontario|date=2010-01-27|accessdate=2015-06-16|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>  In September 2016, it was announced that an agreement had been reached between the parties to allow betting on NBA games on Pro-Line in Ontario to resume beginning with the 2016-17 season.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://corporate.olg.ca/olg-adds-nba-to-pro-line/|title=OLG ADDS NBA TO PRO-LINE|date=2016-09-16|accessdate=2016-09-17|publisher=[[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]]}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/2016/09/16/nba-back-on-olgs-pro-line-after-two-decade-absence.html|title=NBA back on OLG\u2019s Pro-Line after two-decade absence|date=2016-09-16|accessdate=2016-09-17|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>  The move is projected to generate $5-10 million in profit for the province.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lotteries in Canada]]\n[[Category:Sports betting]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n'''Sport Select''' is a group of [[sport]]s [[betting]] games offered by [[Canada]]'s [[province|provincial]] [[government]]s.

The epidemic began with the introduction of the new [[raid (gaming)|raid]] Zul'Gurub and its [[boss (video gaming)|end boss]] Hakkar the Soulflayer. When confronted and attacked, Hakkar would cast a [[Health (gaming)|hit point]]-draining and highly contagious [[debuff]] spell called \"Corrupted Blood\" on players.\n\nThe spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the [[virtual world]] by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal gameplay, as players did what they could do to avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), it lasted until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally controlled the spread.\n\nThe conditions and reactions of the event attracted the attention of [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] for its implications of how human populations could react to a real-world epidemic.\n\n==History==\nThe epidemic began on September 13, 2005, when [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] introduced a new raid called Zul'Gurub into the game as part of a new update. Its end boss, Hakkar the Soulflayer, could affect players by draining their blood and using it to heal himself. By intentionally poisoning one's own blood using a debuff called Corrupted Blood, which did a significant amount of damage to the player over time, Hakkar would drain blood and apply the disease to himself, allowing him to be killed. However, Corrupted Blood could be passed on between any nearby characters, and would kill characters of lower levels in a few seconds, while higher level characters could keep themselves alive. It would disappear as time passed or when the character died.\n\nDue to a programming oversight, when hunters or warlocks dismissed their pets, those pets would keep any active debuffs when summoned again. [[Non-player character]]s could contract the debuff, and could not be killed by it but could still spread it to players; in effect, this turned them into [[asymptomatic]] disease carriers and a form of [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the debuff.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" /> At least three of the game's servers were affected. The difficulty in killing Hakkar may have limited the spread of the disease. Discussion forum posters described seeing hundreds of bodies lying in the streets of the towns and cities. Deaths in ''World of Warcraft'' are not permanent, as characters are resurrected shortly afterward.<ref name=\"BBCwow\">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Ward |title=Deadly plague hits Warcraft world |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-09-22 |access-date=2019-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331184723/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm |archive-date=2019-03-31 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, dying in such a way is disadvantageous to the player's character and incurs inconvenience.<ref name=\"ign20050922\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/22/world-of-warcraft-gets-plagued |title=World of Warcraft Gets Plagued |access-date=2019-04-13 |last=McNamara |first=Tom |date=2005-09-22 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |quote=In-game disease spreads throughout the realm. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413142432/https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/22/world-of-warcraft-gets-plagued |archive-date=2019-04-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the epidemic, normal gameplay was disrupted.

She also compared Corrupted Blood to a [[drug trial]] with mice\u2014\"a real good first step.\" She stated, \"These are my mice [and] I want this to be my new experiment setup.\" She expressed an interest in designing new diseases, perhaps non-fatal ones, to be introduced to the game so she could study how risk is viewed, how rumors would spread, and how public health notices are handled. She added that Blizzard made such notices in the original outbreak, but kept changing its position as it could not effectively deal with the problem. She commented that she did not believe it would ruin gameplay, as ''World of Warcraft'' dealt with health challenges in combat, and that games set in medieval times had such health risk. She argued that if researchers and developers worked together, it could be fun. While Blizzard was initially excited about the proposition, it became less outwardly excited over time, though never rejected it. She has been in contact with other developers, hoping to conduct the simulation in games similar to ''World of Warcraft''.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" />\n\nDr. Gary Smith, professor of Population Biology and Epidemiology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], commented that very few mathematical models of disease transmission take host behavior into account, but also questioned how representative of real life a virtual model could be. He stated that while the characteristics of the disease could be defined beforehand, the study is just as observational as one conducted on a real-life disease outbreak. However, he added that one could argue that the proposal could give an opportunity for a study that epidemiologists may never have.<ref name=\"bbcnews20070821\"/> Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College, London, felt skeptical of the idea, commenting that such a study could not properly mimic genuine behavior. Using the zombie plague used to promote ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King]]'' before its release as an example, players would intentionally become infected to gain zombie powers. He added that characters could also regenerate, meaning there was low risk in becoming infected. He felt that while online games such as ''World of Warcraft'' could be set up to help scientists study epidemics, it will always be limited as their primary use is for entertainment.<ref name=\"times20081028a\" />\n\n===Comparison to COVID-19 pandemic===\nThe [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]] has been compared to the Corrupted Blood incident, and epidemologists who studied the Corrupted Blood outbreak are using the research from the incident to better understand coronavirus' spread - primarily its sociological factors.<ref name=pcgamer /><ref name=pcgamesN /><ref name=extremetech /><ref name=arstechnica /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Krotoski |first1=Aleks |title=Corrupted Blood: what the virus that took down World of Warcraft can tell us about coronavirus |url=https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/corrupted-blood-what-the-virus-that-took-down-world-of-warcraft-can-tell-us-about-coronavirus/ |website=BBC Science Focus |publisher=Immediate Media Company |date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Dr. Eric Lofgren, an epidemologist and co-author of a research paper about Corrupted Blood, stated in an interview with ''[[PC Gamer]]'' that  \"When people react to public health emergencies, how those reactions really shape the course of things.

But really it's a virus that's spreading between people, and how people interact and behave and comply with authority figures, or don't, those are all very important things.

How griefing isn't really analogous to anything that takes place in the real world. People aren't intentionally getting people sick. And they might not be ''intentionally'' getting people sick, but wilfully ignoring your potential to get people sick is pretty close to that.

The epidemic began with the introduction of the new [[raid (gaming)|raid]] Zul'Gurub and its [[boss (video gaming)|end boss]] Hakkar the Soulflayer. When confronted and attacked, Hakkar would cast a [[Health (gaming)|hit point]]-draining and highly contagious [[debuff]] spell called \"Corrupted Blood\" on players.\n\nThe spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the [[virtual world]] by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal gameplay, as players did what they could do to avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), it lasted until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally controlled the spread.\n\nThe conditions and reactions of the event attracted the attention of [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] for its implications of how human populations could react to a real-world epidemic.\n\n==History==\nThe epidemic began on September 13, 2005, when [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] introduced a new raid called Zul'Gurub into the game as part of a new update. Its end boss, Hakkar the Soulflayer, could affect players by draining their blood and using it to heal himself. By intentionally poisoning one's own blood using a debuff called Corrupted Blood, which did a significant amount of damage to the player over time, Hakkar would drain blood and apply the disease to himself, allowing him to be killed. However, Corrupted Blood could be passed on between any nearby characters, and would kill characters of lower levels in a few seconds, while higher level characters could keep themselves alive. It would disappear as time passed or when the character died.\n\nDue to a programming oversight, when hunters or warlocks dismissed their pets, those pets would keep any active debuffs when summoned again. [[Non-player character]]s could contract the debuff, and could not be killed by it but could still spread it to players; in effect, this turned them into [[asymptomatic]] disease carriers and a form of [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the debuff.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" /> At least three of the game's servers were affected. The difficulty in killing Hakkar may have limited the spread of the disease. Discussion forum posters described seeing hundreds of bodies lying in the streets of the towns and cities.

She also compared Corrupted Blood to a [[drug trial]] with mice\u2014\"a real good first step.\" She stated, \"These are my mice [and] I want this to be my new experiment setup.\" She expressed an interest in designing new diseases, perhaps non-fatal ones, to be introduced to the game so she could study how risk is viewed, how rumors would spread, and how public health notices are handled. She added that Blizzard made such notices in the original outbreak, but kept changing its position as it could not effectively deal with the problem. She commented that she did not believe it would ruin gameplay, as ''World of Warcraft'' dealt with health challenges in combat, and that games set in medieval times had such health risk. She argued that if researchers and developers worked together, it could be fun. While Blizzard was initially excited about the proposition, it became less outwardly excited over time, though never rejected it. She has been in contact with other developers, hoping to conduct the simulation in games similar to ''World of Warcraft''.<ref name=\"gamasutra\" />\n\nDr. Gary Smith, professor of Population Biology and Epidemiology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], commented that very few mathematical models of disease transmission take host behavior into account, but also questioned how representative of real life a virtual model could be. He stated that while the characteristics of the disease could be defined beforehand, the study is just as observational as one conducted on a real-life disease outbreak. However, he added that one could argue that the proposal could give an opportunity for a study that epidemiologists may never have.<ref name=\"bbcnews20070821\"/> Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College, London, felt skeptical of the idea, commenting that such a study could not properly mimic genuine behavior. Using the zombie plague used to promote ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King]]'' before its release as an example, players would intentionally become infected to gain zombie powers. He added that characters could also regenerate, meaning there was low risk in becoming infected. He felt that while online games such as ''World of Warcraft'' could be set up to help scientists study epidemics, it will always be limited as their primary use is for entertainment.<ref name=\"times20081028a\" />\n\n===Comparison to COVID-19 pandemic===\nThe [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]] has been compared to the Corrupted Blood incident, and epidemologists who studied the Corrupted Blood outbreak are using the research from the incident to better understand coronavirus' spread - primarily its sociological factors.<ref name=pcgamer /><ref name=pcgamesN /><ref name=extremetech /><ref name=arstechnica /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Krotoski |first1=Aleks |title=Corrupted Blood: what the virus that took down World of Warcraft can tell us about coronavirus |url=https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/corrupted-blood-what-the-virus-that-took-down-world-of-warcraft-can-tell-us-about-coronavirus/ |website=BBC Science Focus |publisher=Immediate Media Company |date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Dr. Eric Lofgren, an epidemologist and co-author of a research paper about Corrupted Blood, stated in an interview with ''[[PC Gamer]]'' that  \"When people react to public health emergencies, how those reactions really shape the course of things. We often view epidemics as these things that sort of ''happen'' to people. There's a virus and it's doing things. But really it's a virus that's spreading between people, and how people interact and behave and comply with authority figures, or don't, those are all very important things.

How griefing isn't really analogous to anything that takes place in the real world. People aren't intentionally getting people sick. And they might not be ''intentionally'' getting people sick, but wilfully ignoring your potential to get people sick is pretty close to that. You start to see people like 'oh this isn't a big deal, I'm not going to change my behavior.' ... Epidemics are a social problem... Minimizing the seriousness of something is sort of real-world griefing.\"<ref name=pcgamer />\n\nThe Corrupted Blood incident was abrupt and far-reaching; Dr. Lofgren expressed that this abruptness is a property of a real pandemic, stating \"Corrupted Blood was this unexpected black swan event. We treat this [coronavirus] as if it's unexpected, but nature is really good at getting people sick\".<ref name=pcgamer /><ref name=arstechnica /> Dr. Nina Fefferman, a co-author of the Corrupted Blood study, expressed that the incident particularly exemplified \"how people perceive threats and how differences in that perception can change how they behave\", and how people discuss a threat on social media, stating that \"A lot of my work since then has been in trying to build models of the social construction of risk perception and I don't think I would have come to that as easily if I hadn't spent time thinking about the discussions ''WoW'' players had in real time about Corrupted Blood and how to act in the game based on the understanding they built from those discussions.\"<ref name=pcgamer>{{cite web |last1=Fenlon |first1=Wes |title=The researchers who once studied WoW's Corrupted Blood plague are now fighting the coronavirus |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-researchers-who-once-studied-wows-corrupted-blood-plague-are-now-fighting-the-coronavirus/ |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |date=March 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name=pcgamesN>{{cite web |last1=Maskell |first1=Ryan |title=The doctors who studied WoW\u2019s virtual blood plague warn of the reality of coronavirus |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/blood-plague-coronavirus |website=PCGamesN |publisher=Network N |date=March 14, 2020}}</ref><ref name=arstechnica>{{cite web |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=What a WoW virtual outbreak taught us about how humans behave in epidemics |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/that-time-world-of-warcraft-helped-epidemiologists-model-an-outbreak/ |website=Ars Technica |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Model for terrorism research===\nIn an analysis of the Corrupted Blood incident, [[Charles Blair (intelligence analyst)|Charles Blair]], deputy director of the Center of Terrorism and Intelligence Studies, said that ''World of Warcraft'' could provide a powerful new way to study how [[terrorist cell]]s form and operate.

Beginning in 1971, the town created [[Planned Unit Development]] (PUD) zoning to accommodate population growth related to the growth of [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby. A PUD allows a developer to plan an entire community before beginning development, thus allowing future residents to be aware of where churches, schools, commercial and industrial areas will be located well before such use begins. Kildaire Farms, a {{convert|967|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} Planned Unit Development in Cary, was North Carolina's first PUD. It was developed on the Pine State Dairy Farm by Thomas F.

This resulted in the formation of the Raleigh-Cary, NC Metro Area and the Durham-Chapel Hill, NC Metro Area.\n\nThe Research Triangle region encompasses OMB's [[Combined Statistical Area|Combined Statistical Area (CSA)]] of Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill in the central [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region of North Carolina. {{as of|2012}}, the population of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill CSA was 1,998,808.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/index.html |title=Population Estimates 2012 Combined Statistical Areas: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=2013-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317045641/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/index.html |archive-date=March 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Raleigh-Cary [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)]] as of Census 2010 was 1,130,490.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cary, North Carolina}}\n[[File:Page-WalkerHotel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Page-Walker Hotel]] (now local history museum)]]\n[[File:Prestontower.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Preston Clocktower in West Cary]]\n\nIn 1750, Cary began as a settlement called Bradford's Ordinary. About 100 years later, the [[North Carolina Railroad]] between [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and [[Hillsborough, North Carolina|Hillsborough]] was constructed through the town, linking Bradford's Ordinary to a major transportation route.\n\nAllison Francis \"Frank\" Page is credited with founding the town.

Beginning in 1971, the town created [[Planned Unit Development]] (PUD) zoning to accommodate population growth related to the growth of [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby. A PUD allows a developer to plan an entire community before beginning development, thus allowing future residents to be aware of where churches, schools, commercial and industrial areas will be located well before such use begins. Kildaire Farms, a {{convert|967|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} Planned Unit Development in Cary, was North Carolina's first PUD. It was developed on the Pine State Dairy Farm by Thomas F. Adams, Jr. Adams named a section of Kildaire Farms \"Farmington Woods\" in their honor.\n\nIn addition to the Page-Walker Hotel, the [[Carpenter Historic District (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Carpenter Historic District]], [[Cary Historic District]], [[Green Level, Wake County, North Carolina|Green Level Historic District]], [[Ivey-Ellington House]], and [[Nancy Jones House]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region of the eastern United States, Cary is near North Carolina's [[Research Triangle Park|Research Triangle]].
