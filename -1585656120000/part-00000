Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling \"Oh, Toodles!\" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atv.disney.go.com/playhouse/mickeymouseclubhouse/stories/ohtoodles/index.html|title=Oh Toodles!

Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling \"Oh, Toodles!\" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atv.disney.go.com/playhouse/mickeymouseclubhouse/stories/ohtoodles/index.html|title=Oh Toodles!

Among his innovations were a sliding theater chair (to allow spectators to slide back to admit newcomers rather than standing), the hand fire extinguisher, and greaseless potato chips.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Hobbies of the Hollywood Stars| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8twDAAAAMBAJ&q=hobbies+hollywood+stars#v=snippet&q=hobbies%20hollywood%20stars&f=false| journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]| volume=63| number=3| page=372-374| accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Juran| first=Robert A.| title=Old Familiar Faces| page=100| publisher=Movie Memories| date=September 1, 1995| isbn=978-0964634008}}</ref><ref>''Variety'', January 25, 1950{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alan Hale 1916.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Hale with [[Pauline Frederick]] in ''The Woman in the Case'' (1916)]]\n[[File:Santa Fe Trail 2.jpg |thumb|250 px|Left to right: [[Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams]], Hale, [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Errol Flynn]] in ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)| Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940)]]\nHis first film role was in the 1911 [[silent movie]] ''[[The Cowboy and the Lady (1911 film)|The Cowboy and the Lady]]''.  He became a leading man while working in 1913-1915 for the [[Biograph Company]] in their special feature film productions sponsored and controlled by [[Marc Klaw]] and [[Abraham Erlanger]]. Later, he became more of a character actor; he played \"[[Little John]]\" in the 1922 film ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'', with [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Wallace Beery]], reprised the role 16 years later in the 1938 ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' with [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Basil Rathbone]], then played him yet again in ''[[Rogues of Sherwood Forest]]'' in 1950 with [[John Derek]] as [[Robin Hood]]'s son, a unique unprecedented 28-year sing of portrayals of the same character in theatrical films. Hale played [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]], in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), featuring in a pivotal confrontation with the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], portrayed by Flynn.\n\nHis other films include the 1922 epic ''[[The Trap (1922 film)|The Trap]]'' with Lon Chaney, 1928's ''[[Skyscraper (1928 film)|Skyscraper]]''; as well as ''[[Fog Over Frisco]]'' with [[Bette Davis]]; ''[[Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen]]'' with [[Baby LeRoy]] and [[William Frawley]]; ''[[The Little Minister (1934 film)|The Little Minister]]'' with [[Katharine Hepburn]]; and ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Claudette Colbert]]; all released in 1934; the 1937 film ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' with [[Barbara Stanwyck]]; ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' with [[Irene Dunne]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]]; ''[[The Fighting 69th]]'' with [[James Cagney]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]; ''[[They Drive By Night]]'' with [[George Raft]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]; ''[[Manpower (1941 film)|Manpower]]'' with [[Edward G.

He also co-starred with Errol Flynn and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in the successful western film ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' (1939) where he played the slightly dimwitted but likeable and comical Rusty Hart, [[sidekick]] to Flynn's character, Sheriff Wade Hatton.

It was later given its present binomial name by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is taken from the [[Ancient Greek]] meaning \"colour of dried vine leaves\", ''xeros'' meaning \"dry\", and ''amp\u011blinos'' or \"of the vine\".<ref>Giovanni Pacioni1993>{{cite book | author = Giovanni Pacioni  | year = 1993 | title = The Macdonald Encyclopedia of Mushrooms and Toadstools (English version) | publisher = Little, Brown & Company Ltd | isbn = 0-316- 90625-5}}</ref><ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4}}</ref>\n\nTwo subspecies have been recognised, var.

Their [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are coloured various shades of wine-red, purple to green. Mild tasting and [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is one of the most highly regarded brittlegills for the table. It is also notable for smelling of shellfish or crab when fresh.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n''Russula xerampelina'' was originally described in 1770 as ''Agaricus xerampelina'' from a collection in [[Bavaria]] by the German mycologist [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]], who noted the colour as ''fusco-purpureus'' or \"purple-brown\". It was later given its present binomial name by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is taken from the [[Ancient Greek]] meaning \"colour of dried vine leaves\", ''xeros'' meaning \"dry\", and ''amp\u011blinos'' or \"of the vine\".<ref>Giovanni Pacioni1993>{{cite book | author = Giovanni Pacioni  | year = 1993 | title = The Macdonald Encyclopedia of Mushrooms and Toadstools (English version) | publisher = Little, Brown & Company Ltd | isbn = 0-316- 90625-5}}</ref><ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4}}</ref>\n\nTwo subspecies have been recognised, var.

Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling \"Oh, Toodles!\" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atv.disney.go.com/playhouse/mickeymouseclubhouse/stories/ohtoodles/index.html|title=Oh Toodles!

Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling \"Oh, Toodles!\" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atv.disney.go.com/playhouse/mickeymouseclubhouse/stories/ohtoodles/index.html|title=Oh Toodles!
