It was held on Tuesday, November 7, 1972. Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] from California defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota. Until the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], this was the largest margin of victory in the Electoral College for a Republican in a U.S. presidential election.\n\nNixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1972|1972 Republican primaries]] to win re-nomination. McGovern, who had played a significant role in [[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reforming]] the Democratic nomination system after the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], mobilized the anti-war movement and other liberal supporters to win his party's [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1972|nomination]]. Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner [[Edmund Muskie]], 1968 nominee [[Hubert Humphrey]], and Congresswoman [[Shirley Chisholm]], the first African-American to run for a major party's presidential nomination.\n\nNixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs, while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the [[Vietnam War]], and the institution of a [[guaranteed minimum income]]. Nixon maintained a large and consistent lead in polling. Separately, Nixon's [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President|reelection committee]] broke into the [[Watergate complex]] to [[wiretap]] the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s headquarters, a scandal that would later be known as \"[[Watergate]]\". McGovern's campaign was further damaged by the revelation that his running mate, [[Thomas Eagleton]], had undergone [[electroconvulsive therapy]] as a treatment for [[clinical depression|depression]]. Eagleton was replaced on the ballot by [[Sargent Shriver]].\n\nNixon won the election in a [[landslide victory|landslide]], taking 60.7% of the popular vote and carrying 49 states while being the first Republican to sweep the [[Southern United States|South]]. McGovern took just 37.5% of the popular vote, while [[John G. Schmitz]] of the [[American Independent Party]] won 1.4% of the vote. Nixon received almost 18&nbsp;million more votes than McGovern, and he holds the record for the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|widest popular vote margin]] in any post-World War II United States presidential election. The 1972 presidential election was the first since the ratification of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]], which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Within two years of the election, both Nixon and Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned from office: the former in August 1974, due to Watergate, the latter in October 1973, due to a separate corruption charge. [[Gerald Ford]] succeeded Agnew as Vice President, then in the following year succeeded Nixon as President.\n\n==Republican nomination==\nRepublican candidates:\n*[[Richard Nixon]], [[President of the United States]] who formed his [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]]\n*[[Pete McCloskey]], [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[California]]\n*[[John M.

Polls showed that Nixon held a strong lead in the Republican primaries. He was challenged by two candidates, [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Pete McCloskey]] from California and [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[John Ashbrook]] from Ohio. McCloskey ran as an anti-war candidate, while Ashbrook opposed Nixon's [[d\u00e9tente]] policies towards [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. In the [[New Hampshire primary]] McCloskey garnered 19.8% of the vote to Nixon's 67.6%, with Ashbrook receiving 9.7%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.primarynewhampshire.com/new-hampshire-primary-past-results.php |title=New Hampshire Primary historical past election results. 2008 Democrat & Republican past results.

His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern's campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1972 United States presidential election|led in the polls]] by large margins throughout the entire campaign. With an enormous fundraising advantage and a comfortable lead in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring to pad his own margin of victory.\n\n===Results===\n[[File:1972prescountymap2.PNG|thumb|right|400px|Election results by county.{{legend|#E32636|[[Richard Nixon]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}\n{{legend|#1560BD|[[George McGovern]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}]]\n[[File:1972 Presidential Election, Results by Congressional District.png|thumb|right|400px|Results by congressional district.]]\nNixon's percentage of the popular vote was only marginally less than Lyndon Johnson's record in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], and his margin of victory was slightly larger.

Technically, these were overvotes, and should not have counted for either the major party candidates or the Socialist Workers Party electors. Within two days of the election, the Attorney General and Pima County Attorney had agreed that all votes should count. The Socialist Workers Party had not qualified as a party, and thus did not have a presidential candidate. In the official state canvass, votes for Nixon, McGovern, or Schmitz, are shown as being for the presidential candidate, the party, and the elector slate of the party; while those for the Socialist Worker Party elector candidates were for those candidates only. In the view of the Secretary of State, the votes were not for Linda Jenness. Some tabulations count the votes for Jenness. Historically, presidential candidate names did not appear on ballots, and voters voted directly for the electors. Nonetheless, votes for the electors are attributed to the presidential candidate. Counting the votes in Arizona for Jenness is consistent with this practice. Because of the confusing ballots, Socialist Workers Party electors received votes on about 21 percent and 8 percent of ballots in Pima and Yavapai, respectively. 30,579 of the party's 30,945 Arizona votes are from those two counties.\n}}| pv_pct=0.11%| ev=0| vp_name=[[Andrew Pulley]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Benjamin Spock]]| party=[[People's Party (United States, 1970s)|People's]]| state=[[California]]| pv=78,759| pv_pct=0.10%| ev=0| vp_name=[[Julius Hobson]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]] }}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Louis Fisher]]| party=[[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor]]| state=[[Illinois]]| pv=53,814| pv_pct=0.07%| ev=0| vp_name=[[Genevieve Gunderson]]| vp_state=[[Minnesota]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Gus Hall]]| party=[[Communist Party USA|Communist]]| state=[[New York (state)|New York]]| pv=25,597| pv_pct=0.03%| ev=0| vp_name=[[Jarvis Tyner]]| vp_state=[[Pennsylvania]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evelyn Reed]]| party=[[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers]]| state=[[New York (state)|New York]]| pv=13,878| pv_pct=0.02%| ev=0| vp_name=[[Clifton DeBerry]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[E.

This represents more than twice the percent of voters who typically defected from their party in presidential elections. Specifically, in the previous five elections, the estimated defection rate among Democratic voters (i.e. the percentage who voted for the Republican presidential candidate) was 16 percent. Nixon also became the first Republican presidential candidate in American history to win the [[Roman Catholic]] vote (53-46), and the first in recent history to win the [[blue-collar]] vote, which he won by a 5-to-4 margin. McGovern narrowly won the union vote 50\u201348, though this difference was within the survey's margin of error of 2 percentage points. McGovern also narrowly won the youth vote (i.e. those aged 18 to 24) 52\u201346, a narrower margin than many of his strategists had predicted. Early on, the McGovern campaign also significantly overestimated the number of young people who would vote in the election: they predicted that 18 million would have voted in total, but exit polls indicate that the actual number was about 12 million. McGovern did win comfortably among both blacks and Jews, but by somewhat smaller margins than usual for a Democratic candidate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/09/archives/new-jersey-pages-desertion-rate-doubles-defectors-gave-nixon.html |title=Desertion Rate Doubles |last=Rosenthal |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Rosenthal (journalist) |date=1972-11-09 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2019-12-01 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Post-election investigations into the Watergate break-in==\n{{Main|Watergate scandal}}\nOn June 17, 1972, five months before election day, five men broke into the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate hotel]] in Washington, D.C.; the resulting investigation led to the revelation of attempted cover-ups of the break-in within the Nixon administration.

It was held on Tuesday, November 7, 1972. Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] from California defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota. Until the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], this was the largest margin of victory in the Electoral College for a Republican in a U.S. presidential election.\n\nNixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1972|1972 Republican primaries]] to win re-nomination. McGovern, who had played a significant role in [[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reforming]] the Democratic nomination system after the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], mobilized the anti-war movement and other liberal supporters to win his party's [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1972|nomination]]. Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner [[Edmund Muskie]], 1968 nominee [[Hubert Humphrey]], and Congresswoman [[Shirley Chisholm]], the first African-American to run for a major party's presidential nomination.\n\nNixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs, while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the [[Vietnam War]], and the institution of a [[guaranteed minimum income]]. Nixon maintained a large and consistent lead in polling. Separately, Nixon's [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President|reelection committee]] broke into the [[Watergate complex]] to [[wiretap]] the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s headquarters, a scandal that would later be known as \"[[Watergate]]\". McGovern's campaign was further damaged by the revelation that his running mate, [[Thomas Eagleton]], had undergone [[electroconvulsive therapy]] as a treatment for [[clinical depression|depression]]. Eagleton was replaced on the ballot by [[Sargent Shriver]].\n\nNixon won the election in a [[landslide victory|landslide]], taking 60.7% of the popular vote and carrying 49 states while being the first Republican to sweep the [[Southern United States|South]]. McGovern took just 37.5% of the popular vote, while [[John G. Schmitz]] of the [[American Independent Party]] won 1.4% of the vote. Nixon received almost 18&nbsp;million more votes than McGovern, and he holds the record for the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|widest popular vote margin]] in any post-World War II United States presidential election. The 1972 presidential election was the first since the ratification of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]], which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Within two years of the election, both Nixon and Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned from office: the former in August 1974, due to Watergate, the latter in October 1973, due to a separate corruption charge. [[Gerald Ford]] succeeded Agnew as Vice President, then in the following year succeeded Nixon as President.\n\n==Republican nomination==\nRepublican candidates:\n*[[Richard Nixon]], [[President of the United States]] who formed his [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]]\n*[[Pete McCloskey]], [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[California]]\n*[[John M.

His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern's campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1972 United States presidential election|led in the polls]] by large margins throughout the entire campaign. With an enormous fundraising advantage and a comfortable lead in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring to pad his own margin of victory.\n\n===Results===\n[[File:1972prescountymap2.PNG|thumb|right|400px|Election results by county.{{legend|#E32636|[[Richard Nixon]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}\n{{legend|#1560BD|[[George McGovern]]|border=1px #AAAAAA solid}}]]\n[[File:1972 Presidential Election, Results by Congressional District.png|thumb|right|400px|Results by congressional district.]]\nNixon's percentage of the popular vote was only marginally less than Lyndon Johnson's record in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], and his margin of victory was slightly larger.

Only [[Massachusetts]] and the [[District of Columbia]] voted for the challenger, resulting in an even more lopsided [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] tally.

Within two days of the election, the Attorney General and Pima County Attorney had agreed that all votes should count.

In the view of the Secretary of State, the votes were not for Linda Jenness. Some tabulations count the votes for Jenness. Historically, presidential candidate names did not appear on ballots, and voters voted directly for the electors. Nonetheless, votes for the electors are attributed to the presidential candidate.

This represents more than twice the percent of voters who typically defected from their party in presidential elections. Specifically, in the previous five elections, the estimated defection rate among Democratic voters (i.e. the percentage who voted for the Republican presidential candidate) was 16 percent. Nixon also became the first Republican presidential candidate in American history to win the [[Roman Catholic]] vote (53-46), and the first in recent history to win the [[blue-collar]] vote, which he won by a 5-to-4 margin. McGovern narrowly won the union vote 50-48, though this difference was within the survey's margin of error of 2 percentage points. McGovern also narrowly won the youth vote (i.e. those aged 18 to 24) 52-46, a narrower margin than many of his strategists had predicted. Early on, the McGovern campaign also significantly overestimated the number of young people who would vote in the election: they predicted that 18 million would have voted in total, but exit polls indicate that the actual number was about 12 million. McGovern did win comfortably among both blacks and Jews, but by somewhat smaller margins than usual for a Democratic candidate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/09/archives/new-jersey-pages-desertion-rate-doubles-defectors-gave-nixon.html |title=Desertion Rate Doubles |last=Rosenthal |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Rosenthal (journalist) |date=1972-11-09 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2019-12-01 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Post-election investigations into the Watergate break-in==\n{{Main|Watergate scandal}}\nOn June 17, 1972, five months before election day, five men broke into the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate hotel]] in Washington, D.C.; the resulting investigation led to the revelation of attempted cover-ups of the break-in within the Nixon administration. What became known as the [[Watergate scandal]] eroded President Nixon's public and political support in his second term, and he resigned on August 9, 1974, in the face of probable [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] by the House of Representatives and removal from office by the Senate.\n\nAs part of the continuing Watergate investigation in 1974\u201375, federal prosecutors offered companies that had given illegal campaign contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign lenient sentences if they came forward.<ref name=\"'70s\">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|authors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/31 31]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/31}}</ref> Many companies complied, including [[Northrop Grumman]], [[3M]], [[American Airlines]] and [[Braniff Airlines]].<ref name=\"'70s\"/> By 1976, prosecutors had convicted 18 American corporations of contributing illegally to Nixon's campaign.<ref name=\"'70s\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[1972 United States House of Representatives elections]]\n*[[1972 United States Senate elections]]\n*[[1972 United States gubernatorial elections]]\n*[[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign]]\n*[[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon]]\n*''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]'', a collection of articles by [[Hunter S.

Although the boundaries of his district changed over the years, it was always anchored in the Chicago lakefront. From the 1970s onward, Chicago's declining population resulted in the district spilling into the northern suburbs. By the time he retired, his district also included [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. \n\nYates was one of the first congressmen to speak out against age discrimination, arguing in 1951 that mandatory retirement of workers was wrong and deprived older people of their ''right to lead a proud, productive and independent life.''\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Yates called for legislation to ban automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives, proclaiming that \"Vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from the cult of the weapon, and the switchblade knife is included in this. Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget\u2014power that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violence\u2014our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime.\"<ref name=\"LEV\">Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993)</ref><ref>Knife World (August 1990)</ref><ref name=\"CON\">Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958</ref>  The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.<ref name=\"CON\"/>  Rep. Yates and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon.<ref name=\"LEV\"/><ref name=\"CON\"/><ref>Knife World Magazine (August 1990)</ref>  However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members began using firearms instead of knives.<ref>Clark, Charles S., ''Youth Gangs Worsening Violence Prompts Crackdowns and Community Mobilization'', Congressional Quarterly 1, 11 October 1991, pp. 753\u2013776</ref>\n\nYates was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[United States Senate]] in 1962 against Republican incumbent and [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Everett Dirksen]]. He briefly served at the [[United Nations]] before returning to the House after the 1964 election. Fellow Democrat [[Edward Rowan Finnegan|Edward Finnegan]] won Yates' old seat after his former district was merged with the 9th, but Chicago machine bosses persuaded him to accept a circuit judgeship in return for letting Yates take his old seat back. Yates served on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] throughout his career and chaired the Interior Subcommittee from 1975 to 1995. On this committee he supported environmental programs and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].\n\nYates remained on good terms with both liberal reformers and machine politicians in Chicago throughout his career. He also served on the Foreign Operations subcommittee and was a strong advocate of American support for [[Israel]]. He worked hand-in-hand with his chief of staff, [[Mary Anderson Bain|Mary Bain]], to preserve federal funding for the arts and for Natural Heritage Preservation programs, and to establish the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]].\n\nIn 1993, he was presented with the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and in 1997 he received the [[Four Freedoms Award]] for Freedom of Speech<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325223647/http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |archivedate=2015-03-25 }}</ref> In 1999, the Auditors Building in [[Washington, DC]], was renamed the [[Sidney Yates Building]] in his honor.<ref name=DMUSDA>[http://www.dm.usda.gov/buildings.htm#Yates%20Building Histories of the USDA Headquarters Complex Buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721071326/http://www.dm.usda.gov/buildings.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}, U.S. Department of Agriculture Departmental Management website, accessed July 28, 2011</ref>\n\nIn his closing months of service, he surpassed [[Robert L.

He holds the record as the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|10th longest-serving member]] in the history of the US Congress, and also has the longest tenure of all members whose time in Congress included a break in service.\n\n==Family==\nYates was married to Adeline Holleb (1914\u20132002) for 65 years.

Although the boundaries of his district changed over the years, it was always anchored in the Chicago lakefront. From the 1970s onward, Chicago's declining population resulted in the district spilling into the northern suburbs. By the time he retired, his district also included [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. \n\nYates was one of the first congressmen to speak out against age discrimination, arguing in 1951 that mandatory retirement of workers was wrong and deprived older people of their ''right to lead a proud, productive and independent life.''\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Yates called for legislation to ban automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives, proclaiming that \"Vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from the cult of the weapon, and the switchblade knife is included in this. Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget\u2014power that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violence\u2014our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime.\"<ref name=\"LEV\">Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993)</ref><ref>Knife World (August 1990)</ref><ref name=\"CON\">Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958</ref>  The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.<ref name=\"CON\"/>  Rep. Yates and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon.<ref name=\"LEV\"/><ref name=\"CON\"/><ref>Knife World Magazine (August 1990)</ref>  However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members began using firearms instead of knives.<ref>Clark, Charles S., ''Youth Gangs Worsening Violence Prompts Crackdowns and Community Mobilization'', Congressional Quarterly 1, 11 October 1991, pp. 753\u2013776</ref>\n\nYates was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[United States Senate]] in 1962 against Republican incumbent and [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Everett Dirksen]]. He briefly served at the [[United Nations]] before returning to the House after the 1964 election. Fellow Democrat [[Edward Rowan Finnegan|Edward Finnegan]] won Yates' old seat after his former district was merged with the 9th, but Chicago machine bosses persuaded him to accept a circuit judgeship in return for letting Yates take his old seat back. Yates served on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] throughout his career and chaired the Interior Subcommittee from 1975 to 1995. On this committee he supported environmental programs and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].\n\nYates remained on good terms with both liberal reformers and machine politicians in Chicago throughout his career. He also served on the Foreign Operations subcommittee and was a strong advocate of American support for [[Israel]]. He worked hand-in-hand with his chief of staff, [[Mary Anderson Bain|Mary Bain]], to preserve federal funding for the arts and for Natural Heritage Preservation programs, and to establish the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]].\n\nIn 1993, he was presented with the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and in 1997 he received the [[Four Freedoms Award]] for Freedom of Speech<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325223647/http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |archivedate=2015-03-25 }}</ref> In 1999, the Auditors Building in [[Washington, DC]], was renamed the [[Sidney Yates Building]] in his honor.<ref name=DMUSDA>[http://www.dm.usda.gov/buildings.htm#Yates%20Building Histories of the USDA Headquarters Complex Buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721071326/http://www.dm.usda.gov/buildings.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}, U.S. Department of Agriculture Departmental Management website, accessed July 28, 2011</ref>\n\nIn his closing months of service, he surpassed [[Robert L. Doughton]] as the oldest person ever to serve in the House (Yates was surpassed in this record by [[Ralph Hall]] (R-Texas) in 2012). He holds the record as the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|10th longest-serving member]] in the history of the US Congress, and also has the longest tenure of all members whose time in Congress included a break in service.\n\n==Family==\nYates was married to Adeline Holleb (1914\u20132002) for 65 years.  They were the parents of Stephen R. Yates (1940-2000), who served as an Illinois circuit court.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Jewish members of the United States Congress]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{CongBio|Y000013}}\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511015407/http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/papers/2000/2000_vol2_2063.pdf |date=May 11, 2010 |title=''Statement on the Death of Representative Sidney R.
